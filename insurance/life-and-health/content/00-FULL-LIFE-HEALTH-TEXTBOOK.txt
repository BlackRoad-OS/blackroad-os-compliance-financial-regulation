                                the classroom or for self-study students. There is a cram sheet, quick quizzes, and a unit quiz that will test you
                                for understanding. Answer keys are provided at the end of each unit for the quick quiz and unit quiz.

                  Does this book include state specific laws and regulations?
                      No. This book includes general information that is applicable in most states. All state and some federal
                      information can be found in the Law Supplement.

                  How long do I need to study?
                      Depending on the state that you are in, you may be required to study for a certain number of hours. In most
                      cases we recommend 40 hours of focused study time. Before you start your studies, build a customized study
                      calendar based on the number of days that you have to study before you plan to sit for your state exam. This
                      calendar can be found in your dashboard in your online tools.

                            What if I have content related questions during my studies?
                             If you purchased a package that includes online tools, you have access to our InstructorLinkTM*. These online
                             instructional resources provide important direction, references, and answers to questions, helping you to
                             prepare fully for the state exam.

                            IMPORTANT: Check for Updates
                             States sometimes revise their exam content outlines unexpectedly or on short notice. We suggest that you check
                             for updates when you first receive the course, again during your study period, upon completion of your studies,
                             and one last time just before you take your insurance license exam. Updates are located in your online tools on
                             the dashboard.

                             This book was written by industry professionals, and contains topics included in the multiple-choice questions

                              1.1   INTRODUCTION
                                    When you enter the insurance industry, regardless of your role, you will need to know many things
                                    including the purpose of each policy, the claims settlement process, and the language of insurance
                                    including important terms, definitions, and concepts. Understanding insurance is like putting a puzzle
                                    together piece by piece.

                                    Unit One introduces you to terms and insurance concepts; the border of the puzzle. The definitions
                                    in this unit represent the framework for the remainder of the course and are highly tested on the state
                                    exam. Important words and content are bolded in the text and a glossary is located in the back of this
                                    book to assist you with the learning process.

                                    Throughout this course you will study the pieces of the insurance puzzle and they will build a solid
                                    foundation for passing your insurance licensing exam. When you begin studying you might struggle
                                    with the content and the language, but like a puzzle, completing all the units will form the entire
                                    picture.

        1.3        DEFINITIONS
                   An insurance policy is a legal contract and the terminology can be confusing. This unit will address
                   common insurance terms and provide realistic examples to help you understand the definitions.

                   Insurance is a contract that transfers the risk of financial loss from an individual or business to an
                   insurer. In return the insurer agrees to cover the individual or business for certain losses if they occur.

                   Risk is uncertainty about whether a loss will occur. If a loss is certain to occur, it does not involve risk.
                   Insurance is designed to cover only losses that involve risk. In regard to life insurance, although death is
                   certain to occur to everyone, the timing of that loss is uncertain.

                              There are two types of risk: speculative risk and pure risk. Speculative risks have a possibility of a loss
                              and also hold the possibility of making a gain. Insurance companies will not insure gambling losses
                              or investments because someone could win money or you could lose money, these are examples of
                              speculative risks.

                              Pure risks, on the other hand, only involve the possibility of experiencing a loss and they can be
                              covered by insurance. The chance of being in a car accident is an example of a pure risk.

                              Loss is a reduction in the value of an asset. To determine the amount of a loss, the value of the asset is
                              measured before and after the loss.

                   Exposure is the risk assumed by an insurer and the amount that the insurer is responsible to pay out
                   at any given time. Exposure is expressed in units. For example, the unit for life insurance exposure is
                   $1,000 of death benefit and premium rates apply per unit of exposure.

                   The calculation for insurance premiums is the rate multiplied by the number of exposure units. For
                   example: if the life insurance rate is $32 per $1,000 of death benefit, the premium for a $100,000 policy
                   would be $32 x $100 = $3,200.

                   A peril is a cause of loss. The insurer agrees to cover losses caused by a specified peril. For life
                   insurance, the peril is death. For health insurance, the perils are accidents or illness. For example, if a
                   house burns down, the peril (cause of loss) is the fire. If electronics in a home are destroyed because of
                   lightning, the cause of loss (peril) is lightning. If you drive your car through a hailstorm and the car’s
                   body is damaged, the peril is hail. A peril is simply what caused the loss.

                              A hazard is anything that increases the chance that a loss will occur. Hazards do not cause the loss.
                              When you think of the term hazard, think of something that becomes more dangerous and can make
                              a loss more likely to happen. Think of hazards in the same way you parent a child. When the parent
                              says to their child, “Get down before you get hurt!” the parent recognizes a higher chance of the child
                              getting hurt based on what they are doing and, for that reason, the chance of getting hurt is increased.

                              Hazards do not cause losses, but they make a loss more likely.

                              There are three types of hazards: physical, moral, and morale. As their name implies, physical hazards
                              are physically identifiable factors that increase the chance of loss.

                              In life and health insurance, a heart condition is a physical hazard because it is physically identifiable
                              using lab equipment that produces tangible evidence of its existence.

                              Moral hazards arise from an individual’s character. Dishonesty is a moral hazard because it increases
                              the chance that an individual might lie on an insurance application or fake a loss.

                              Morale hazards are a state of mind or careless attitude. In common usage, a morale hazard is an
                              unconscious change in a person’s actions or behaviors, versus a deliberate change with the intent to
                              cheat or benefit from such circumstances. An example of a morale hazard is the insured carelessly
                              leaving the doors and windows unlocked when not at home.

        1.4        METHODS OF HANDLING RISK
                   There are a number of methods for handling risk. It is easy to remember them by thinking of the
                   acronym STARR.

                   Sharing—In risk sharing, two or more individuals agree to pay a portion of any loss incurred by any
                   member in the group. Stockholders in a corporation share the risk of profit or loss.

                   Transfer—Transfer of risk is what happens with insurance. The insurer agrees to pay if an individual or
                   business has a loss. The individual or business has a cost in the form of a premium payment. However,
                   in contrast to the loss, which is large and uncertain, the premium is a much smaller certainty.

                   Insurance companies use the risk management method of transfer to spread a risk of loss among
                   thousands if not millions of insureds. Not everyone will experience an accident while they own an
                   insurance policy. The large number of insureds who do not have an accident will be paying for the
                   losses of the few who do have an accident. This is the only way that insurance can work and make the
                   premiums affordable.

                   Avoidance—Risk avoidance means eliminating a particular risk by not engaging in a certain activity.
                   For example, an individual who does not drive avoids the risk of injuring someone in a collision and
                   being held liable for those damages (e.g., work from home if the roads are covered in ice).

                   Reduction—Risk reduction may refer to lessening the chance that a loss will occur, or to lessening the
                   extent of a loss that does occur. For example, wearing seatbelts reduces the severity of a car accident;
                   installing a smoke alarm will not prevent a fire, but it may keep individuals from serious harm.

                   Retention—Risk retention means the individual will pay for the loss if it occurs. Without health
                   insurance a person will have to pay the bill if they need hospitalization. This is an example of
                   intentionally retaining a risk.

        1.5        OTHER INSURANCE CONCEPTS

                   1.5.1 The Law of Large Numbers
                   The Law of Large Numbers is the principle that makes insurance possible. The larger the group, the
                   more accurately losses can be predicted. Insurance companies cover millions of people and businesses.
                   It is impossible to guess specifically who will suffer a loss in the future, but thanks to the law of
                   large numbers, they can be fairly certain how many losses will occur in the group as a whole. While
                   insurance companies cannot specifically name which individuals will have a loss each year; they can
                   predict fairly accurately how many dollars in claims they will have to pay out each year based on
                   the actual losses they experienced in the past. This prediction allows them to charge each insured a
                   premium that, pooled together, will cover all claims and operating costs.

                   1.5.2 Elements of Insurable Risk
                   Not all risks are insurable. Risks that can be insured have the following characteristics. It is easy to
                   remember them by thinking of the acronym CANHAM.

                         1. Calculable—Premiums must be calculable based upon prior loss statistics for that particular risk
                            in order to predict future losses.
                         2. Affordable—The premium for transferring the risk should be affordable for the average consumer.
                         3. Non-catastrophic—Insurance cannot insure events that cause widespread losses to large numbers
                            of insureds at the same time. That is why the peril of war is excluded from most policies because
                            the risk is much too large for the insurance company to pay.
                         4. Homogeneous—The individual risks that the insurer covers must all be similar, or homogeneous,
                            in regard to factors that affect the chance of loss.
                         5. Accidental—Insurance is a method of handling risk. If a loss is certain to occur, there is no risk.
                         6. Measurable—It must be possible to estimate the loss as a dollar amount. Insurance covers the
                            financial loss of unexpected death or medical bills from sickness.

                              1.5.3 Adverse Selection
                              Adverse selection is the tendency for higher-risk individuals to get and keep insurance more than
                              individuals who represent an average level of risk. The statistics insurers use to predict their losses are
                              based on average risks. Adverse selection could cause the insurance company to experience more losses
                              than predicted. It increases the chance that they have not collected enough premiums to pay for their
                              losses.

                              To avoid adverse selection, insurers make an extensive evaluation of information related to a particular
                              risk—a process called underwriting. If an underwriter determines that a risk is higher than average, the
                              insurer may charge a higher rate to insure the risk, limit the amount of coverage it will issue on the risk,
                              or refuse the application for insurance altogether.

                     1.5.4 Reinsurance
                     Reinsurance is like insurance for insurers. It transfers risk from one insurer to another insurer. To
                     reduce the total amount of loss it is liable for, one insurer may pay the other insurer a premium to
                     assume a portion of its risk. The company reducing its risk is called the ceding insurer. The company
                     assuming the risk is called the reinsurer.

                     Example: Insuring risks in certain geographical areas may expose the insurer to the potential of having
                     to pay for a large number of losses at one time. This may happen due to such things as earthquake
                     or hurricane. To protect the company from these catastrophic losses, the insurer pays a premium to
                     another insurer to transfer some or all of its risks in these areas. The company accepting the risk is
                     called the reinsurer. There are two ways this process can work.

                             1. The reinsurer considers each risk before allowing the transfer to be made from the ceding
                                company. This is called facultative reinsurance.
                             2. The reinsurer accepts all risks of a certain type from the ceding company. This is called treaty
                                reinsurance


                                                                                          Reinsurance

        1.6          TYPES OF INSURERS

                     1.6.1 Stock Insurers
                     A stock insurer is a business formed as a public or private corporation and owned by its stockholders,
                     also known as shareholders. The board of directors that oversees the operation of the company is
                     chosen by the stockholders/shareholders. Profits from the insurance operation may be distributed to
                     the stockholders as dividends. The policies issued by stock insurers are called non-participating, or
                     non-par, policies to distinguish them from the participating policies issued by mutual insurers (covered
                     next).

                               1.6.2 Mutual Insurers
                               A mutual insurer does not have stock or stockholders. It is owned by its policyholders, also known
                               as policyowners. They elect a board of directors that in turn appoints the officers who operate the
                               company. Funds that remain after paying claims and operating costs may be distributed to the
                               policyowners as policy dividends. Mutual policy dividends are considered to be a non-taxable return
                               of excess premium. Mutual policies are referred to as participating, or par, policies because the
                               policyowners participate in the operating results of the company.

                               1.6.3 Fraternal Benefit Societies
                               Fraternal benefit societies exist for the benefit of its members and offer life insurance as one of the benefits
                               of membership. Fraternals also provide social activities and usually engage in charitable and benevolent
                               causes. Fraternals are organized under a lodge system, operate as nonprofit societies, and receive some
                               income tax advantages. They operate their insurance programs under a special section of the state
                               insurance code. Fraternal policies are called certificates, and members who own life insurance are called
                               certificate holders. A distinctive feature of fraternal life insurance is that certificate holders may be assessed

                   feature are referred to as open contracts. By comparison, mutual and stock insurers are not assessable
                   and are sometimes referred to as legal reserve companies.

                   1.6.4 Reciprocal Insurers
                   Reciprocal insurers are unincorporated groups of people that agree to insure each other’s losses under
                   a contract. The members of the reciprocal groups are known as subscribers. Each subscriber has an
                   account through which premiums are paid and earned interest is tracked. If any subscriber suffers a loss
                   covered by the reciprocal insurance agreement, each subscriber account is assessed an equal amount to
                   pay the claim. Administration, underwriting, sales promotion, and claims handling for the reciprocal
                   insurance are handled by an attorney-in-fact. The attorney-in-fact is often controlled and overseen by
                   an advisory committee of subscribers.

                               A risk retention group (called a RRG) is an insurer formed for the sole purpose of providing liability
                               insurance to its policyholders. An RRG is owned by the insureds or members. The policyholders
                               must all be members of the same type of business. They are regulated by the state where they are
                               headquartered; however, they can operate in other states as well.

                               1.6.6 Lloyd’s Associations
                               Lloyd’s Associations, named in reference to the famous underwriting group Lloyd’s of London, are
                               not insurance companies. Rather, they provide a hub for the exchange of information among member
                               underwriters who actually transact the business of insurance. Members are individually liable and
                               responsible for the contracts of insurance into which they enter.

                               Over the years, Lloyd’s Associations have insured unusual risks such as hole-in-one contests, the hair of

                   1.6.7 Self-Insurers
                   Self-insurance is a means of retaining, rather than transferring, risk. Businesses may develop a formal
                   program for self-insuring all or a portion of certain risks. They set aside savings to cover losses in
                   advance and may even have a claim system like an insurance company. They often contract with an
                   insurance company to manage the day-to-day operation of the business.

        1.7        CLASSIFICATION OF INSURERS

                   1.7.1 Private vs. Government Insurers
                   The types of insurers we have described so far are all insurers that operate in the private sector. In
                   addition to private sector insurers, various government entities may also provide insurance to the
                   public or to certain government employees.

                   The federal government provides a wide variety of insurance benefits through a number of programs.
                   These include Social Security benefits, military life insurance benefits, federal employee compensation
                   benefits, and various retirement benefit programs. It also provides, supports, or subsidizes a number of
                   insurance programs designed to cover catastrophic risks, including insurance for war risks, flood, and
                   crop losses.

                   At the state level, governments are involved in providing unemployment insurance, workers’
                   compensation insurance, disability insurance, and medical insurance for the needy. Local governments
                   also participate in providing medical, disability, and retirement benefits.

                               1.7.2 Domestic, Foreign, and Alien Insurers
                               Depending on where an insurer is incorporated, it is classified as being domestic, foreign, or alien.

                                      ■ In its home state–that is, the state in which the insurer was formed (chartered or incorporated)
                                        and is headquartered–an insurer is referred to as domestic insurer. An insurer’s home state is also
                                        called its state of domicile.
                                      ■ An insurer that writes business in states other than where it is domiciled is referred to as a foreign
                                        insurer. For example, an insurer that is located in Texas, but is selling insurance in Wisconsin, is
                                        considered foreign.
                                      ■ An insurer formed under the laws of any country other than the United States and its territories
                                        is considered an alien insurer. To citizens of the United States or any U.S. territory such as Puerto
                                        Rico, an insurer based in any other country is an alien insurer.
                               The following illustration provides a visual treatment of these classifications.

                   1.7.3 Authorized vs. Unauthorized Insurers
                   States usually require companies to have a license to sell insurance in the state. The license is called a
                   Certificate of Authority. When a company is licensed it is called admitted or authorized.

                   Some states allow companies to sell insurance to certain types of risks (called surplus) without having
                   to have a license. These companies are then called nonadmitted, unauthorized, or nonapproved.


                                                                                          • Certificate of Authority–state

                   1.7.4 Surplus Lines Insurers
                   Sometimes an individual or a business will have an exceptionally large or specialized risk that no
                   authorized insurer can or will cover. In such cases, insurance may be obtained from an unauthorized/
                   non-admitted insurer on a surplus lines basis. Surplus lines insurance is placed with a non-admitted
                   carrier by a surplus lines agent or broker.

                   Surplus lines insurance can only be transacted according to certain rules governing that type of
                   business. For example, states keep lists of acceptable surplus lines insurers and the insurer through
                   which surplus lines coverage is obtained. There are also rules that do not allow surplus lines insurance
                   to be purchased only to get a cheaper rate when the insurance is available from an authorized insurer.

                   Surplus lines insurance is also called excess and surplus lines because in some cases a limited amount
                   of coverage is available from an authorized insurer, and only the excess is obtained through the surplus
                   lines insurer.

                   Gaming, casinos and entertainment, mining, and skyscrapers are all examples of exposures that might
                   require surplus lines insurance.

                               1.7.5 Financial Ratings of Insurers
                               Insurers may also be classified according to their financial strength. There are several independent
                               rating agencies that evaluate various factors such as an insurer’s loss experience, reserves, investment
                               performance, management, and operating expenses. They then assign an insurer a rating based on that
                               analysis.

                               The organizations that rate insurers include AM Best, Inc., Standard & Poor’s Insurance Rating
                               Services, Moody’s Investors Service, Duff & Phelps Credit Rating Company, and Weiss Ratings. These
                               firms do not all rate every company, and each firm has different criteria on which companies are

        1.8        INSURANCE MARKETING OR DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS
                   The following are descriptions of several different systems insurers use to market or distribute their
                   products to the public.

                   1.8.1 Agency Systems
                   Most insurers sell their products through insurance producers (brokers or agents). Brokers​legally
                   represent the insured. Agents legally represent the insurer, not the insured. There are four different
                   types of agents.

                   Independent insurance agents ​are individuals that sell the insurance products of several companies
                   and are independent contractors, not employees of the insurer. Independent agents own the renewals of
                   the policies they sell.

                               Exclusive or captive agents represent only one company. These agents are sometimes referred to as
                               career agents. Captive agents are independent contractors, not employees of the insurer. The insurance
                               company owns the renewals of the policies sold on their behalf.

                               General agents (GAs) or managing general agents (MGAs) hire, train, and supervise other agents
                               within a specific geographical area. GAs and MGAs receive overriding commissions (overrides) on the
                               business produced by the agents they manage.

                               Direct-writing companies usually pay salaries to employees whose job function is to sell the company’s
                               insurance products from a company office. This type of producer is not usually paid a commission and
                               the insurer owns all of the business produced.

        1.9        LAW OF AGENCY
                   Agency is a relationship in which one person is authorized to represent and act for another person or
                   for a corporation. The person authorized to act on behalf of the other is called an agent. The person
                   on whose behalf the agent acts is called the principal. In insurance, the insurer is the principal and the
                   sales representative or producer is the agent. An agency relationship is created by the consent of both
                   the agent and the principal.

                   Under the law of agency, contracts made by the agent are considered to be contracts of the principal.
                   When the employer/principal provides specific directions and exerts more control over an individual/
                   agents’ job duties, then an agency relationship may exist. Payments made to an agent, within the scope
                   of the agent’s authority, are considered to be received by the principal. The knowledge of the agent is
                   assumed to be the knowledge of the principal. Therefore, the principal is liable for the statements and
                   actions of their agents.

                   1.9.1 Agent Authority
                   Under the law of agency, there are three types of authority: express, implied, and apparent.

                   Express authority is the authority made explicit in a producer’s written agency agreement with the
                   insurer. Express authority is the wording in the contract that specifically tells the producer what they
                   can and cannot do. For example, if the producer is given express authority to write a $100,000 life
                   insurance policy, he cannot write a $105,000 policy.

                   Implied authority is not written in the agency contract, but it is assumed to be granted to an agent in
                   accordance with general business practices. For example, an agent’s contract may not say in writing
                   that the agent has the right to print business cards with the insurer’s logo on them, but this authority is
                   implied by allowing the agent to act on the insurer’s behalf. Implied authority is power that the agent
                   believes he or she has because it is necessary for the agent to conduct the business of the insurer.

                   Apparent authority is authority that others believe the agent has. If the insurer’s name is on the sign
                   at the agent’s place of business, and the agent takes applications for the insurer’s policies, then the
                   agent apparently has the insurer’s authority to conduct its business as far as the public is concerned.
                   Sometimes, agents may act with apparent authority that the insurer did not intend the agent to
                   have. But the insurer may still be bound by those actions if the agent’s apparent authority creates a

                                                                                                            Unit 1   General Insurance         21



                               presumption of agency in the mind of the insured. For example, if an agent sends an insured an email
                               stating their policy covers flooding but in reality the policy excludes flooding from coverage, the
                               company could be made to pay the claim because of the actions of its agent. For example, a company
                               hires an agent to sell its insurance policies. To perform this act the agent must conduct appointments,
                               make sales presentations, assist the customer with the application, and collect premiums. These powers,
                               since they are a necessary part of the express duties of the agent, are implied powers. When the agent
                               performs any or all of these duties, whether express or implied, it is as if the principal has done so.

                               1.9.2 Responsibility to Applicants/Insureds
                               Agents have a fiduciary responsibility to applicants and insureds. A fiduciary is a person in a position
                               of financial trust. As a fiduciary, the agent has an obligation to act in the best interest of the insured.
                               The following are examples of an agent’s fiduciary responsibility.

                               All premiums received by an agent are funds received and held in trust. The agent must account for
                               and pay the correct amount to the insured, insurer, or other agent entitled to the money. The insured’s
                               premiums must be kept separate from the agent’s personal funds.

                               Failure to do this can result in commingling—mixing personal funds with the insured’s or insurer’s
                               funds.

                               Any agent who takes funds held in trust for personal use is guilty of theft and will be punished as
                               provided by law.

                               The agent must be knowledgeable about the features and provisions of various insurance policies and
                               be able to explain important features to the insured.

                               Suitability considerations—An agent has a responsibility to make purchase recommendations that are
                               appropriate, or suitable, in light of a client’s particular needs, objectives, and circumstances. Suitable
                               recommendations can only be made if an agent obtains information about an applicant’s needs,
                               objectives, and circumstances, and then gives thought to how a product’s features and benefits will
                               address the applicant’s situation.

                               1.10 INSURANCE AND CONTRACT LAW

                                   1.10.1 Elements of a Legal Contract (CLOAC)
                                   Insurance policies are legal contracts and are subject to the general law of contracts. To form a valid
                                   contract, five elements must be present.

                                        ■ Consideration
                                        ■ Legal purpose
                                        ■ Offer
                                        ■ Acceptance
                                        ■ Competent parties

                                   1.10.1.1 Legal Purpose
                                   To be valid, a contract must be for a legal purpose and not contrary to public policy. For example, an
                                   agreement to purchase stolen goods would not be a valid contract because it lacks legal purpose.

                                   1.10.1.2 Agreement (Offer and Acceptance)
                                   There cannot be a contract without the agreement of the parties. The parties to an insurance contract
                                   are the insurance company and the applicant. An agreement is reached when one party accepts the offer
                                   made by the other party with no conditions.

                                   An offer is a proposal made by one of the potential parties to the contract. An applicant who submits
                                   a completed application to an insurer along with a payment for the first premium is making an offer to
                                   become insured by the insurer. If the policy is issued as applied for, the insurer has accepted the offer.

                                   There is no offer if the applicant sends the application to the insurance company without payment
                                   of the premium. Such an application is merely an invitation to the company to make an offer. The
                                   insurance company makes an offer by issuing the policy. The applicant accepts it by paying the first
                                   premium.

                                   Acceptance of an offer must be unconditional and unqualified. If acceptance is qualified or conditional,
                                   no agreement has been reached. A qualified acceptance is actually a rejection of the offer and is called a
                                   counter offer.

                                   1.10.1.3 Consideration
                                   Consideration refers to an exchange of value. When you see the word consideration think MONEY!
                                   Each party to the contract must give something valuable to the other. In an insurance contract, the
                                   applicant provides consideration in the form of the information (representations) in the application and
                                   the premium payment, and the insurer provides consideration in the form of a promise to pay if certain
                                   loss occurs.

                                   1.10.1.4 Competent Parties
                                   For a contract to be binding, both parties must have the legal capacity to make a contract. The insured
                                   or applicant must be of legal age (usually 18) and be mentally competent to make an insurance contract.
                                   Applications of minors usually must be signed by an adult parent or guardian.

                               1.10.2 Characteristics of Insurance Contracts
                               Insurance policies possess a number of special legal characteristics. This unique combination of features
                               reflects the distinctive nature of the insurance contract.

                               1.10.2.1 Adhesion
                               Insurance policies are contracts of adhesion—that is, their provisions are written by only one party to
                               the contract, and the other party is required to adhere, or stick, to them. In the case of insurance, it is
                               the insurer who writes the contract’s terms and the insured that must adhere.

                               If there is any ambiguity (doubt) in the wording of a contract of adhesion, courts will interpret the
                               wording in favor of the adhering party. That is, parties that have no input into the wording of a contract
                               and no power to change it cannot be held responsible for any unclear contract language. This puts the
                               insurer at a disadvantage in any legal dispute arising from a lack of clarity in a provision’s wording, and
                               gives the advantage to the policyowner, insured, or beneficiary.

                               1.10.2.2 Aleatory
                               Insurance policies are aleatory contracts, meaning that the value received from the contract by each
                               party may be unequal. Ordinarily, each party to a contract is expected to receive benefits from the
                               contract that are at least roughly equivalent. In the case of insurance, the receipt of unequal value arises
                               because the insurer’s performance under the contract depends upon an uncertain event—that is, the
                               occurrence of a loss which may or may not happen. The insured may pay premiums for many years and
                               receive no monetary value in return if the loss does not occur. On the other hand, the insured may pay
                               only one relatively small premium and receive thousands of dollars in return if a covered loss occurs
                               shortly after the policy goes into effect. Such unequal receipt of value is the defining feature of an
                               aleatory contract.

                   1.10.2.3 Utmost Good Faith, Reasonable Expectation
                   Insurance is a contract of utmost good faith. This means that each party is entitled to a reasonable
                   expectation that the other party will not try to conceal pertinent information or otherwise act
                   deceptively. Violation of that reasonable expectation can void the claims of the offending party under a
                   contract of utmost good faith.

                   1.10.2.4 Unilateral
                   Insurance policies are unilateral, or one-sided, contracts because only one party is legally bound to
                   perform under the contract. The insured has the right to stop paying premiums at any time. However,
                   as long as the insured keeps the contract in force by paying the premiums, the insurer is required by law
                   to pay for any covered losses that occur.

                               1.10.2.5 Personal
                               Property-casualty insurance policies (such as auto and homeowners insurance) are personal contracts,
                               but life and health insurance policies are not.

                               A personal contract is one made with a particular person and no one else. The contract cannot be
                               transferred to a different person.

                               With a homeowners policy, for example, the insurer evaluates not only the condition of the property,
                               but also whether the insured will take reasonably good care of the property. A different person would
                               represent a different risk, so the contract does not allow a change of parties.

                               With life insurance, the insurer contracts not with the insured, but with the policyowner. The insured
                               and the policyowner are often the same person, but they do not have to be. For example, a wife can
                               apply for a policy on her spouse, in which case the wife applying for the insurance is the policyowner
                               and the spouse is the insured.

                               In addition, owners have rights, one of which is to transfer their ownership to another party. For example,
                               if the woman wished, she could transfer ownership of the policy on her husband to a trust. (Other
                               examples of ownership rights and policyowners other than insureds will be covered later in this course.)

                               Such a transfer does not affect a life insurance policy’s status as a contract because it is not a personal
                               contract. The insurer has a contract not with a particular person, but with whatever party is the policyowner.

                   1.10.2.6 Conditional
                   Insurance policies are conditional contracts because they require certain conditions to be fulfilled in
                   order for performance under the contract to be enforced. For example, the contract may require certain
                   documents to be submitted to prove that a loss has occurred. In the case of life insurance, a death
                   certificate must be filed.

                   1.10.2.7 Indemnity
                   Insurance policies are contracts of indemnity, meaning that the contract is intended to restore the
                   insured to the financial state he or she enjoyed prior to the occurrence of a loss–no more and no less.
                   The principle of restoring an insured to his or her pre-loss financial state is known as indemnification.
                   This principle applies to health insurance but not life insurance. It is not possible to restore the insured
                   in a life insurance policy because payment occurs upon death.

                               1.10.2.8 Representations, Misrepresentations, and Warranties
                               A representation is a statement that is believed to be true, to the best of one’s knowledge at the time
                               it is given. A misrepresentation is a representation that is actually false. For example, suppose Adam
                               signs an insurance application as “Adam L. Jones” even though his birth certificate shows no middle
                               name–he just adopted the “L” because he thinks it sounds good. Adam represents himself as Adam L.
                               Jones, but the “L” is a misrepresentation.

                               Misrepresentations do not necessarily void insurance contracts. To do so, they must be material
                               misrepresentations—that is, the false information must have been a determining (or material) factor
                               in the insurer’s acceptance of the risk. If the insurer would have rejected the application or written the
                               coverage on a different basis had the correct facts been known, the information is material.

                               For example, Adam’s harmless adoption of middle initial does not affect him as a risk, so it is not a
                               material misrepresentation and would not void his policy. If Adam said he was not being treated for a
                               heart condition when in fact he was, that would be a material misrepresentation.

                                                                                                   Representation—believed to be true
                                                                                                     • Misrepresentation—information

                                                                                                       company’s decision—insured

                     A warranty is a statement that is guaranteed to be true. If a warranty is not kept, there is a breach of
                     warranty that voids the contract.

                     Applicants for property-casualty insurance sometimes make warranties to an insurer. For example, a
                     business may guarantee that it will hire a security guard. If it does not, its property insurance policy will
                     be void.

                     However, for life and health insurance, most state laws say that statements or responses to questions on
                     an application are representations and not warranties. That is, an untrue statement on a life or health
                     insurance application is not a breach of warranty. To be grounds for voiding the contract, it must be
                     material to the insurer’s acceptance of the risk.

                     1.10.2.9 Concealment
                     Concealment is the intentional failure to disclose known facts. An insurer may be able to void the
                     insurance contract if it can prove that an applicant or insured intentionally concealed a material fact (a
                     previous heart attack).

                               1.10.2.10 Fraud
                               Fraud is an intentional act designed to deceive and induce another party to part with something of
                               value.

                               Fraud may involve misrepresentation, concealment, or both, but not all acts of misrepresentation or
                               concealment are acts of fraud. If someone intentionally lies to obtain coverage or to collect on a false
                               claim, it would be a matter of fraud. If someone misrepresents something on an application (perhaps a
                               medical treatment the person is embarrassed to talk about) without intent to obtain something of value,
                               no fraud has occurred.

                                   2. Imprisonment may be ordered for up to 15 years if the false statements jeopardized the safety and
                                      soundness of an insurer and were a significant cause of the insurer being placed in conservation,
                                      rehabilitation, or liquidation by the courts.

                   1.10.3.1 Waiver and Estoppel
                   Waiver is defined as the intentional and voluntary giving up of a known right.

                   Estoppel is a legal doctrine that prevents a party from denying an action if it had been accepted
                   previously.

                   For example, by repeatedly accepting late premium payments, an insurance company may have waived
                   its right to cancel a policy for nonpayment or late payment of premium. In the future, the insurer may
                   be legally estopped from making any prompt cancellation for nonpayment because the policyholder has

                          ■ Speculative risk—chance of loss or gain. Not insurable.
                          ■ Pure risk chance of loss only. Insurance companies will insure.
                   Exposure—risks for which the insurance company would be liable.

                   Peril—a cause of loss

                   Hazard—something that causes an increase in the chance of loss

                          ■ Physical hazard—the hazard can be seen.
                          ■ Moral hazard—a belief that intentionally causing a loss is acceptable
                          ■ Morale hazard—carelessness

                   CANHAM Risks that can be insured have the following characteristics

                          ■ Calculable
                          ■ Affordable
                          ■ Non-catastrophic

                                                                   Underwriting




                               2.1   INTRODUCTION
                                     Underwriting is a critical part of the insurance application process. The information that is gathered
                                     enables insurance companies to properly classify and determine premiums for prospective insureds.

                                     Insurance company underwriters are able to determine the amount of risk an applicant poses for the
                                     company and whether the company wants to accept or decline that risk. Underwriters work closely
                                     with actuaries, risk managers, and claims managers to protect the company from potential claims.
                                     Simultaneously, they determine which new risks are going to be profitable and which existing clients
                                     are worth retaining.

                                     This unit discusses how insurance agents assist insurers to identify appropriate prospects and describes
                                     the steps involved to provide a comprehensive and suitable insurance policy.

                2.2            LEARNING OBJECTIVES

                      After completing this unit, you will be able to:

                          ӽ explain the importance of the underwriting process;
                          ӽ identify the producers responsibilities in completing the insurance application including,
                            confidentiality, accuracy, changes in the application, completeness, backdating, required
                            signatures, producer’s report, and information practices;
                          ӽ describe the collection of the first premium and the two types of receipts that can be issued:
                            conditional and binding;
                          ӽ explain the underwriter’s responsibility once the insurer receives the application;
                          ӽ list the details that are found in the General (Part I) and Health (Part II) sections of the application;
                          ӽ describe the following concepts that are related to the underwriting process: attending physician’s
                            statement, medical examinations and testing, AIDS considerations, HIPAA disclosures, Medical
                            Information Bureau, Consumer reports, and Investigative consumer reports;
                          ӽ identify the four classifications of insurance risk: standard, preferred, substandard, and declined;
                          ӽ explain selection criteria and unfair discrimination;
                          ӽ explain the producer’s responsibility in delivering and servicing the insurance policy: policy
                            review, statement of good health, and effective date of coverage; and
                          ӽ describe the purpose of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, Stranger Oriented Life Insurance (STOLI/
                            IOLI), the U.S Patriot Act, and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA).


        2.3        UNDERWRITING
                   Underwriting is the process of evaluating a risk to determine if it is acceptable based on established
                   insurance company guidelines. Everything begins with the producer/agent when a decision to buy is
                   made and the agent completes the application for insurance and submits it to the company underwriter.
                   The agent/producer is frequently referred to as the field underwriter.


        2.4        COMPLETING THE APPLICATION
                   Completing the application is an important responsibility for the producer/agent. The information
                   in the application is the basis for issuing the policy, which in turn provides the client with valuable
                   benefits. Producers must approach the completion of the application with an eye toward confidentiality,
                   accuracy, and completeness.

                   2.4.1 Confidentiality
                   Highly personal information about an applicant is acquired during the application process. Agents need
                   to inform applicants that the information they share will be kept in the strictest confidence and producers
                   must never violate that confidence. Completed applications must be kept out of others’ sight except for
                   company representatives and the information gathered should never be the subject of idle talk.

                               recording the correct answer to every question on the application. The company underwriter is relying
                               upon application accuracy to correctly assess and rate this business.

                               2.4.2.1 Changes in the Application
                               A correction can be made if a producer finds they have mistakenly recorded applicant information.
                               The applicant must certify that an error occurred and place their initials next to the correction. Some
                               insurers also require the producer to initial any change.

                               2.4.3 Completeness
                               Incomplete applications cause a delay in the underwriting process because they must be returned to the
                               agent for completion. This means the applicant will wait longer without needed insurance protection.
                               All the required information must be available for review by the underwriting department before a
                               policy can be approved and issued.

                               If a policy is issued and the application was incomplete, the underwriter on behalf of the company
                               waives its right to that information. If a claim arises, the company cannot deny it based on the fact that
                               information was missing from the application.

                               2.4.4 Backdating
                               Some insurers allow an application to be backdated so the premium can be based on an applicant’s
                               earlier age and lower the cost of the premium. Backdating would permit a 41-year old applicant to
                               purchase a life insurance policy using the age of 40. Most state laws allow life insurance applications to
                               be backdated up to six months.

                               If an application is backdated, the policy becomes effective as of the date requested on the application.
                               To receive a less expensive premium, the applicant must pay any additional premiums that would have
                               been paid from the backdate.

                   2.4.5.1 Producer’s Report
                   Part III of a life insurance application is the Producer/Agents Report, or Producer’s Statement.
                   The producer records information that pertains to the proposed insured including the producer’s
                   relationship to the proposed insured and anything the producer knows about the proposed insured’s:

                           ■ financial status,
                           ■ habits, and

                               2.4.6 Information Practices
                               The life insurance producer must comply with the requirements for notifying applicants about the
                               insurer’s privacy policy as it relates to the personal information collected during the application process
                               and how it will be used.

                               2.4.6.1 Disclosure Notification
                               State laws require that applicants be given advance written notice stating who is authorized to disclose
                               personal information, the kind of information that may be disclosed, and the reason it is being
                               collected. By signing the disclosure form, the applicant is giving the insurer consent to gather and
                               disseminate information as described in the notice.

                               2.4.7 Collecting the Premium
                               An “offer to buy” insurance exists when the first premium is submitted with the life insurance
                               application. If no premium is submitted with the application coverage is delayed until the premium
                               is paid for the issued policy. If the insured becomes uninsurable or dies between the time when the
                               application is submitted and the first premium is collected, the policy will pay no benefit.

                               2.4.8 Receipts
                               When the first premium is collected at the time of application, the producer must provide the applicant
                               with a receipt. The effective date of coverage will depend on the type of receipt issued.

                               2.4.8.1 Conditional Receipt
                               The date of the application is the effective date of a conditional receipt, as long as the applicant is found
                               to be insurable under the company’s standard underwriting rules. Most conditional receipts are effective
                               on the date of the application, or the date of a required medical examination, whichever is later of these
                               two events.

                   With conditional receipts, if the proposed insured dies before a policy is issued, the application
                   continues through the normal underwriting process and one of the following will occur:

                           ■ If the deceased insured meets the company’s standard underwriting requirements and a policy
                             would have been issued had they lived, the policy is in force and the death benefit will be paid to
                             the beneficiary.
                           ■ If the insured is found to be uninsurable or a substandard risk, no coverage would be in force.
                             The premium that was collected with the application will be returned to the policyowner or
                             beneficiary (in the case of death).

                   found to be uninsurable. Binders are most often used with auto or homeowners insurance and rarely
                   with life insurance. Life insurance binders are called temporary insurance agreements. The insurer can
                   either issue a policy or cancel the binder before the end of the stated period.

                               2.5   COMPANY UNDERWRITING
                                     Each insurance company has its own set of underwriting guidelines to help the underwriter determine
                                     whether or not the company should accept the risk. The information used to evaluate the risk of an
                                     applicant for insurance will depend on the type of coverage involved.

                                     2.5.1 Sources of Information
                                     The factors that insurers use to classify risks should be objective, clearly related to the likely cost of
                                     providing coverage, practical to administer, consistent with applicable law, and designed to protect the
                                     long-term viability of the insurer. The application is an underwriter’s primary source of information.

                                     2.5.1.1 The Application
                                     The application used to purchase life insurance asks the applicant for basic information. There are three
                                     parts to an application.

                                          ■ Part 1—General Information
                                          ■ Part 2—Health Information

                   2.5.1.1.1 General Information

                   The first part (Part 1) of the application asks for general or personal data regarding the insured. For
                   example:

                          ■ Name
                          ■ Address
                          ■ Date of birth

                          ■ Marital status
                          ■ Income
                          ■ Occupation and business address
                          ■ Type of policy and face amount being applied for
                          ■ Beneficiary
                          ■ Other insurance owned
                   In addition, if the applicant is someone other than the insured, the applicant’s name and address will
                   also be requested.

                   2.5.1.1.2 Health Information

                   The second part (Part II) of the application is designed to obtain information about the insured’s
                   physical condition and habits:

                          ■ Height and weight
                          ■ Tobacco usage
                          ■ Drug usage
                          ■ International travel

                          ■ Medications being taken
                          ■ Conditions the insured has sought treatment for or been diagnosed with in the past
                          ■ History of disability claims
                          ■ Health conditions prevalent in the insured’s family
                          ■ High-risk hobbies (aviation, skydiving, scuba diving, auto/boat/motorcycle racing, mountain
                            climbing)
                          ■ Name and address of current physician

                   2.5.1.2 Attending Physician’s Statement (APS)
                   An underwriter may ask the proposed insured’s regular doctor for an Attending Physician’s Statement
                   (APS) to find out about the applicant’s current condition and medical history with the physician. The
                   underwriter may also ask for copies of medical records.

                                                                                            Unit 2   Life/Health Insurance Underwriting         49



                               2.5.1.3 Medical Examinations and Testing
                               Insurers will underwrite some applications on a non-medical basis when the death benefit applied for
                               is below a certain level. These applications are evaluated on health information on the application. The
                               insurer usually requires the proposed insured to take a medical examination for larger death benefit
                               amounts. These exams can be conducted by a registered nurse, paramedic, and some applicants are
                               required to have a doctor’s examination with stress testing, scans, EKG’s, MRI’s, etc. The amount of
                               death benefit determines the type of examination and testing required by the insurer.

                               The insurer pays for medical exams and tests that are requested during the underwriting process.

                               2.5.1.3.1 AIDS Considerations

                               The applicant’s sexual orientation cannot be used in the underwriting process or to determine
                               insurability. However, specific questions about being diagnosed with AIDS (Acquired Immune
                               Deficiency Syndrome) or ARC (AIDS-related complex) to determine a medical condition can be asked.

                               AIDS testing can be required with the applicant’s written consent. For example, an insurer may require
                               AIDS testing for certain amounts of insurance. The applicant must be informed about the purpose of
                               the test and that the results are reported to the insurer.

                               If the results are positive, a report is sent to the Medical Information Bureau (MIB) that an individual
                               has abnormal blood test results.

                               The presence of AIDS is never revealed, reported, or shared and can only be released to persons
                               designated by the applicant, such as a particular physician. If the applicant does not designate a medical
                               provider, state law may require the results to be forwarded to the state’s Department of Health. Similar
                               to other required health examinations, AIDS tests are also paid by the insurer.

                               2.5.1.3.2 HIPAA Disclosures

                               The Health Insurance Portability and Account­ability Act (HIPAA) imposes specific requirements on
                               the disclosure of insureds’ health information by medical providers, insurers, and producers. Health
                               information must remain confidential to protect an ap­plicant’s privacy. If any health information will be
                               shared, applicants must be given full notice of:

                                    ■ the insurer’s information-sharing practices;
                                    ■ their right to maintain privacy; and
                                    ■ an opportunity to refuse to have their information released.

                               2.5.1.4 Medical Information Bureau
                               The Medical Information Bureau is a non-profit insurance trade association that maintains
                               underwriting information on applicants. According to the Federal Trade Commission, member MIB
                               companies account for 99% of individual life insurance policies and 80% of health and disability
                               policies issued in the U.S. and Canada. When member companies discover unfavorable information
                               about an applicant during their underwriting process, they report it to the MIB using codes signifying
                               certain conditions. If the applicant applies for insurance elsewhere, other members companies will have
                               access to this information. The types of information maintained in MIB files include medical history,
                               hazardous jobs or hobbies, and poor driving records.

                   The purpose of the MIB is to reduce instances of misrepresentation and fraud. It is important to note:

                          ■ Insurers may not make an adverse underwriting decision (such as rejecting the applicant) solely
                            on the basis of information from the MIB. Insurers may only use this information to further their
                            investigation.
                          ■ Insurers do not report underwriting decisions to the MIB. This prevents other member insurers
                            to accept or reject an applicant based on what other insurance companies have done.
                          ■ An applicant must be given written notice that information may be reported to and obtained
                            from the MIB, and insurers must get an applicant’s written authorization to do so.
                          ■ Applicants must also be notified that applying for insurance or filing a claim with another
                            company may trigger the release of MIB information.

                   2.5.1.5 Consumer Reports
                   Consumer reports are used to determine a consumer’s eligibility for personal credit (credit report) or
                   insurance or for employment. They may be issued only to persons who have a legitimate business need
                   for the information.

                   Underwriters use an applicant’s credit report to determine if they are reliable when paying their
                   monthly bills. Issuers count on policyholders to pay their premium to defer the high initial costs to
                   issue a life insurance policy. It can take several years for certain policies to become profitable for a life
                   insurer.

                   2.5.1.6 Investigative Consumer Reports
                   Investigative consumer reports are reports containing information obtained by interviewing
                   individuals who know something about the consumer such as associates, friends, and neighbors.
                   Consumers must be notified and give their consent to having such reports done. In the insurance
                   industry, investigative consumer reports are also called inspection reports.

                   2.5.2 Classification of Risks
                   Every life insurance company has different underwriting guidelines that determine what risk class an
                   individual qualifies for. The company will look at an applicant’s personal medical history, smoker status,
                   height/weight profile, medical exam results, family history, motor vehicle record, and any hazardous
                   activities.

                   After applicants are evaluated, they are sorted into groups, or classified, according to the level of risk
                   each represents. There are generally four classifications.

                   2.5.2.1 Standard
                   Standard risks mean average health and normal life expectancy and fall into the normal range
                   anticipated by the company when it established its premiums. These risks can be insured for standard
                   rates.

                   2.5.2.2 Preferred
                   Preferred risks represent excellent health. A risk of loss that is below average and therefore favorable to
                   the company. Favorable risk factors include such things as healthy lifestyle, clean medical history, or
                   low-risk occupation. These risks may be insured at preferred or discounted rates.

                   2.5.2.3 Substandard
                   Substandard risks represent below average life expectancy, high-risk life insurance. A risk of loss that
                   is above average and therefore unfavorable to the company. Unfavorable risk factors include poor
                   health, dangerous occupation, or risky habits. Substandard risks can only be accepted by charging
                   them higher rates. Substandard risks are sometimes referred to as being rated up (sometimes shortened
                   to just rated). Methods of charging a relatively higher rate for substandard risks include adding a flat
                   additional charge, charging applicants the standard premium for a higher attained age, or reducing the
                   benefits provided by the policy.

                   2.5.2.4 Declined
                   An insurer’s underwriting guidelines indicate that an applicant is not insurable at any price. In such
                   cases, the application or risk is declined.

                                     2.5.3 Selection Criteria and Unfair Discrimination
                                     Insurers must not unfairly discriminate between individuals who are in the same risk class. Specifically,
                                     use of any of the following is considered unfair discrimination:

                                           ■ Race
                                           ■ Religion
                                           ■ National origin
                                           ■ Place of residence (the area where someone lives)
                                     In addition, most states prohibit unfair discrimination against individuals who are blind, or victims of
                                     domestic violence.

                                     2.6.1 Personal Delivery
                                     When a policy is issued, it must be delivered to the policyowner. It can be mailed, but in most
                                     companies it is the producer’s responsibility to deliver it in person. In some states, producers must
                                     obtain a receipt from the policyowner acknowledging that the policy was delivered and the date.

                   2.6.2 Policy Review
                   During the delivery appointment, the producer will review with the policyowner the policy, riders,
                   exclusions, and other details to make sure they understand it. The producer should also answer any
                   pertinent questions the policyowner has about the policy they purchased.

                   2.6.4 Effective Date of Coverage
                   When the first premium is collected at the time of application for a policy, the effective date of coverage

                               If the proposed insured is found to be a substandard risk, the policy that is issued will require
                               substandard/higher premiums because the initial application for insurance was forwarded with a
                               standard premium.

                                      ■ If the applicant declines the substandard policy and does not pay the additional premium,

                     The federal Fair Credit Reporting Act requires consumer reporting agencies to adopt reasonable
                     procedures for exchanging information on credit, personnel, insurance, and other subjects in a manner
                     that is fair and equitable to the consumer with respect to the confidentiality, accuracy, relevancy, and
                     proper use of this information.

                            ■ All insurers and their producers must comply with the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act regarding
                              information obtained from a third party concerning the applicant.
                            ■ Reports on consumers are prohibited unless the consumer is made aware that an investigative
                              consumer report may be made, and that such report may contain information about the person’s
                              character, reputation, personal characteristics, and lifestyle.
                     A Notice to Applicant must be issued to all applicants for life or health insurance coverage. This notice
                     informs the applicant that a report will be ordered concerning their past credit history and any other
                     life or health insurance for which they have previously applied. The agent must leave this notice with
                     the applicant along with the receipt.

                            ■ This notice must be given to the consumer no later than three days after a report was requested.
                            ■ A consumer may make a written request for a complete disclosure of the nature and scope of the
                              investigation underlying the report.
                                 – Disclosure must be made in writing within five days after the date on which the consumer’s
                                   request was received.
                     Consumer Rights Consumers who feel that information in their files is inaccurate or incomplete may
                     dispute the information, and the reporting agencies may be required to reinvestigate and correct or
                     delete information. Insurance companies may use consumer reports, or investigative consumer reports,
                     to compile additional information regarding the applicant. If applicants feel that the information
                     compiled by the consumer inspection service is inaccurate, they may send a brief statement to the
                     reporting agency with the correct information.

                     Penalties Violators of the Fair Credit Reporting Act may be subject to fines and imprisonment and may
                     be required to pay any actual damages suffered by a consumer, punitive damages awarded by a court,
                     and reasonable attorney’s fees. The maximum penalty for obtaining consumer information reports
                     under false pretenses is $5,000, imprisonment for one year, or both.

        2.9          STOLI/IOLI
                     Stranger-Owned Life Insurance (STOLI) or Investor-Owned Life Insurance (IOLI) transactions are
                     life insurance arrangements involving investors who persuade seniors to take out a new life insurance
                     policy, with the investors named as the beneficiary.

                     The investors often loan money to the insured to pay the premiums for a specific period of time. Often
                     times, that is two years based on the life insurance policy’s contestability period. After that period, the
                     insured names the investor as beneficiary of the policy.

                     Seniors generally receive some financial inducement for this arrangement: an upfront payment, a loan
                     or a small continuing interest in the policy death benefit. Most states are banning STOLI transactions
                     because the investor as a beneficiary does not have insurable interest in the insured and it has become a
                     method of fraud targeted at senior citizens.

        2.10 ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING PROVISIONS OF THE USA
             PATRIOT ACT
                     The overall purpose of the USA PATRIOT Act is to deter terrorist activity, both globally and in the
                     United States in particular. One of the ways it does that is by establishing measures to prevent, detect,
                     and prosecute international money laundering and financing of terrorism. Under the USA PATRIOT
                     Act, companies that issue permanent life insurance, annuities, or other products that have cash value
                     or investment features must adopt procedures and internal controls for recognizing and reporting
                     potential money-laundering activities. An insurer’s anti-money laundering program must be headed
                     by a compliance officer responsible for implementing the program, include ongoing training of
                     appropriate individuals within the company, and be independently tested to assure its effectiveness. The
                     types of suspicious activity that insurers must report include:

                               ■ receipt of any cash payment in excess of $10,000;
                               ■ purchase of insurance that is not consistent with the customer’s needs;
                               ■ requests to have refund or surrender proceeds or other benefits paid to a party not clearly related
                                 to the purchaser;

                               2.11 EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA)
                                   ERISA was enacted to protect the interests of participants in employee benefit plans as well as the
                                   interests of the participants’ beneficiaries. Much of the law deals with qualified pension plans, but some
                                   sections also apply to group insurance plans.

                                   2.11.1 Fiduciary Responsibility
                                   ERISA mandates very detailed standards for fiduciaries and other parties-in-interest of employee
                                   welfare benefit plans, including group insurance plans. This means that anyone with control over plan
                                   management or plan assets of any kind must discharge that fiduciary duty solely in the interests of the
                                   plan participants and their beneficiaries. Strict penalties are imposed on those who do not fulfill this
                                   responsibility.

                                   Reporting and Disclosure ERISA requires that certain information concerning any employee
                                   welfare benefit plan, including group insurance plans, be made available to plan participants, their
                                   beneficiaries, the Department of Labor (DOL), and the IRS. Examples of the types of information that
                                   must be distributed include:

                                         ■ a summary plan description to each plan participant and the Department of Labor;
                                         ■ a summary of material modifications that details changes in any plan description to each plan
                                           participant and the Department of Labor;
                                         ■ an annual return or report (Form 5500 or one of its variations) submitted to the DOL;
                                         ■ a summary annual report to each plan participant; and
                                         ■ any terminal report to the DOL.

                               3.1   INTRODUCTION
                                     The primary reason for buying life insurance is to protect a family when a family member dies. It can
                                     also be used to protect a business, transfer wealth from one generation to another, provide retirement
                                     income, and serve as a source of financing.

                                     Life insurance is perhaps the most versatile form of insurance and can serve many purposes relating to
                                     its value as insurance.

                                     This unit discusses the uses of a life insurance policy, the legal aspects of these policies, ownership
                                     considerations, and other fundamental contract provisions.

        3.3        THIRD-PARTY OWNERSHIP AND INSURABLE INTEREST
                   When a life insurance policy’s applicant and insured are the same, it is a two-party contract between the
                   insurer and the owner/insured. However, as has been previously discussed, the owner of a life insurance
                   policy is not always the insured. In that case, there are three parties to the contract:

                          ■ the insurer,
                          ■ the insured, and
                          ■ the owner/applicant.
                   Third-party ownership refers to a situation where the owner of a life insurance policy is someone other
                   than the insured.

                   By allowing a life insurance policy to have third party ownership does not mean people can apply for
                   life insurance on just anyone. To have a policy issued on someone else’s life, the applicant must have an
                   insurable interest in that person. Insurable interest means that the person applying for the policy must
                   be at risk of suffering a significant loss if the insured dies. The loss may be:

                          ■ emotional, based on love and affection; or
                          ■ economic, based on financial dependency such as the insured’s income.

                   3.3.1 Relationships That Create Insurable Interest
                   Individuals have an insurable interest in their own life. That is, there is no question of insurable interest
                   in two-party situations where the applicant and the insured are the same person.

                                                                                                             Unit 3   Basics of Life Insurance         69



                                     In the personal insurance market, insurable interest exists:

                                            ■ between spouses or domestic partners;
                                            ■ between parents and children; and
                                            ■ among other close family members.
                                     In the business insurance market, insurable interest exists:

                                            ■ among business partners;
                                            ■ between corporations and their officers and directors; and
                                            ■ between any type of business and its key employees.
                                     Insurable interest exists between lenders (creditors) and the people that owe them money (debtors).

                                     3.3.2 When Must Insurable Interest Exist?
                                     In property and casualty insurance (auto, homeowners etc.), insurable interest must exist at the time a
                                     loss or claim occurs. If someone sells a house and it later burns down, that individual cannot claim a
                                     loss even if a policy remained in force.

                                     With life insurance, insurable interest is only required at the time of application. For example,
                                     a business buys key person life insurance on the life of the senior vice president of marketing. The
                                     business is the owner of the policy and the party designated to receive the money if the insured dies;
                                     the beneficiary. If the senior vice president quits working for the company in six months and premiums
                                     are paid to keep the policy in force, the company remains the beneficiary because the only requirement
                                     for life insurance is that insurable interest existed when the policy was purchased.

                                                                                                        Must Prove Insurable Interest
                                                                                                           • Have financial or emotional loss

                                     Life insurance helps to relieve the financial strain that a person’s death may cause for surviving family
                                     members. There are other uses and needs that life insurance can help individuals accomplish.

                   3.4.2.1 Survivor Protection
                   The risk of death makes surviving family members financially vulnerable. The deceased party’s income
                   ends upon their death and for a one-income family, the source of their financial support ends. In a two-
                   income family, the loss of one earner’s wage can make it impossible to keep up a standard of living built
                   on a multiple income household.

                   Survivors can be a spouse and children or other loved ones that depend on the financial support of the
                   income earner. This could include aging parents or a disabled sibling.

                   Another need for life insurance is the death of a stay-at-home mom or dad who provided daycare
                   or homemaking services. This can put a strain on the widowed working parent’s or their children’s
                   finances.

                   In any case, the life insurance death benefit can be used to replace a deceased individual’s economic
                   contribution to relieve or eliminate a surviving family’s financial distress. While still alive, the insured
                   has the peace of mind of knowing that their survivors are protected financially if the worst should
                   happen to them.

                   3.4.2.2 Mortgage Payoff
                   The largest lifetime financial obligation for families is their home mortgage. A mortgage life insurance
                   policy will pay off this debt if the insured dies and assures that their surviving family will be able to stay
                   in their home.

                   3.4.2.3 Estate Creation
                   An individual’s estate are the assets they leave behind at death. The source for most family estates is
                   built over years by saving money out of income, by purchasing a home, making sound investments, and
                   other items of value. Dying too young robs an individual of the time needed to accumulate assets. For
                   people in their working years, life insurance can create an estate if pre-mature death prevents them
                   from doing so themselves.

                   3.4.2.4 Estate Conservation
                   Death poses a different problem for people who have accumulated an estate. Dying comes with debt
                   that must be paid from an individual’s estate. This includes estate (death) taxes and probate expenses—
                   the size of the estate determines the amount of taxes due. What starts out as a large estate may be much
                   smaller by the time the money gets to the heirs and they are not able to enjoy the standard of living that
                   the deceased wanted them to have.

                   Estate planning is also important with life insurance so that it can be used to pay the expenses incurred
                   at someone’s death. Life insurance can ensure the estate is conserved and kept intact for the heirs as the
                   individual intended.

                   3.4.2.5 Liquidity
                   Liquidity can be a problem when an individual dies because the costs incurred at death must generally
                   be paid in cash. If the estate does not have enough cash, other assets must be liquidated to get it. If those
                   assets are illiquid or if the stock market happens to be down when securities must be sold, those assets
                   cannot be liquidated for their full value.

                                                                                                          Unit 3   Basics of Life Insurance         71



                               Liquidity refers to how easily an asset can be turned into cash without loss of value. Examples of liquid
                               assets are:

                                      ■ bank savings or checking accounts—the most liquid assets after cash itself; and
                                      ■ life insurance proceeds—are paid in cash.
                               Examples of illiquid assets include:

                                      ■ precious metals (gold, silver, etc.), precious gems, or stamps;
                                      ■ real estate;
                                      ■ farms and farming equipment; and
                                      ■ small or privately held business interests.
                               A life insurance policy is a good solution to estate liquidity problems. When the insured dies, it turns
                               into cash to pay the estate’s expenses, avoiding the possibility that other estate assets will have to be sold
                               at a loss.

                               3.4.2.6 Cash Accumulation
                               Another personal use of life insurance is to accumulate cash. Permanent life insurance policies have
                               a cash value component that grows over time. The life insurance cash value is called the policies living
                               benefits. This money can be used for a number of purposes, such as:

                                      ■ emergencies; to fix a heating system or repair a leaking roof;
                                      ■ opportunities; starting up a new business;
                                      ■ an education fund for children or grandchildren; and
                                      ■ a supplementary retirement income.

        3.5        DETERMINING AMOUNT OF PERSONAL LIFE INSURANCE

                   3.5.1 Human Life Value
                   According to the principle of human life value, the purpose of life insurance is to replace an
                   individual’s economic value and this begins with a straightforward calculation:

                                the amount of the individual’s annual income × the number of years until retirement

                   Example: Dan is 35 years old, earns $50,000 yearly, and plans to retire in 30 years at age 65. Calculation:
                   $50,000 × 30 = $1,500,000 is the amount of money Dan will earn by the end of his working years.

                   3.5.2 The Needs Approach
                   The needs approach is similar to the human life value and is used to find the amount of insurance
                   coverage an individual should buy. But instead of focusing on income, the needs approach looks at
                   the financial situation the survivors will face if the individual dies. The needs approach is much more
                   detailed than the human life value approach, and it results in a more accurate number. The needs
                   approach is also more commonly used than the human life value approach.

                   Survivors’ financial needs fall into two categories:

                          ■ cash needs; and
                          ■ income needs.

                               3.5.2.1 Cash Needs
                               Cash needs are those that can be met with a lump of money. This includes:

                                    ■ final expenses—funeral/burial costs and final medical bills;
                                    ■ debt payoff—home mortgage, credit cards, car loans, other installment loans;
                                    ■ children’s education—a fund to pay the future cost of college or trade school; and
                                    ■ emergency fund—unexpected expenses that can cause a hardship for the surviving family.

                               3.5.2.2 Income Needs
                               Income needs are those created by ongoing living expenses such as food, clothing, utilities, and a
                               mortgage. There are three distinct income need periods.

                                    ■ Family Dependency—during this period the surviving children are too young to support
                                      themselves and depend on the surviving parent for their needs.
                                    ■ Preretirement—at this point the children have grown up and become self-supporting, but the
                                      surviving spouse has not yet reached retirement age.
                                    ■ Retirement—now the surviving spouse is no longer earning an income.
                               Social Security pays survivor benefits during the family dependency and retirement periods. However
                               during the preretirement period, often called the blackout period, payments are suspended.

                               Blackout period—The Social Security Administration provides benefits for surviving spouses with
                               children under age 16. When the youngest child turns 16, benefits stop and do not resume until the
                               surviving spouse turns 60. Example: A widowed spouse is 40 years old with two children, ages 12
                               and 14. Social security would stop paying a benefit to the spouse at age 44, and resume/begin paying a
                               benefit at age 60.

                               3.5.2.3 Coordinating with Other Resources
                               After determining the income needs of the survivors, those amounts are reduced by any financial
                               resources that will be available to the survivors when the income earner dies. Those resources may
                               come from three places:

                                    ■ existing assets such as bank savings accounts and investment accounts or Individual Retirement
                                      Accounts (IRAs);
                                    ■ employer life insurance or retirement benefits payable to a surviving spouse; and
                                    ■ Social Security that can pay benefits to the surviving dependents.

                   3.5.3 Business Uses of Life Insurance
                   Life insurance has long been a valuable tool that business owners use to reduce risk and to provide
                   the basic financial foundation for continued success. Most business owners recognize the importance
                   of life insurance and use it to solve many of the problems associated with maintaining and growing a
                   successful company.

                   3.5.3.1 Buy-Sell Funding
                   Buy-sell agreements provide for the sale of a business interest at the death or disability of an owner.
                   They are often referred to as business continuation plans.

                   To make sure that purchasers have the money needed to buy a business interest when an owner dies,
                   buy-sell agreements can be funded with life insurance. The policy is on the business owner’s life, and
                   the buyer of the business is the beneficiary. The amount of the death benefit is the purchase price of the
                   business interest as stated in the buy-sell agreement.

                   There are two types of buy-sell agreements: entity and cross-purchase plans.

                           ■ Under an entity plan, the purchaser of a deceased owner’s business interest is the business entity
                             itself. When funded by life insurance, the business entity owns a policy on the life of each business
                             owner. If the business is a corporation, entity plans are often called stock redemption plans because
                             the corporation is actually redeeming the deceased owner’s stock. The term entity plan is usually
                             used with non-incorporated businesses such as partnerships.
                           ■ Under a cross-purchase plan, the surviving owner(s) purchase the deceased owner’s interest in
                             the business. When funded by life insurance, each partner (or shareholder, if the business is a
                             corporation) owns a policy on the lives of each of the other partners. If there are more than two
                             partners or shareholders, many more policies are needed for a cross-purchase plan than an entity
                             plan.

                               3.5.3.2 Key Person Coverage
                               Just as a family depends on the financial contribution of an income-earner, a business may depend on a
                               particular employee whose contribution is key to its success. Businesses can protect themselves against
                               the financial harm that would result from the death of such an employee with key person coverage.

                               The business owns, pays for, and is the beneficiary of the policy on the key person’s life. If the key
                               person dies, the insurance proceeds can be used to offset direct financial losses such as a drop in sales
                               as well as to help pay the costs of finding and training a replacement.

                               3.5.3.3 Executive Bonus Plans
                               Rather than giving a yearly bonus to an employee in cash, companies can use the money to buy a life
                               insurance policy for the employee. Under an executive bonus plan, a business pays the premiums
                               on a life insurance policy which the employee owns. During life, the employee has full access to the
                               policy’s living benefits, and at death the proceeds are paid to the beneficiary named by the employee.
                               An executive bonus plan, or Section 162 bonus plan, is a nonqualified employee benefit arrangement in
                               which an employer pays a bonus to a particular employee. The bonus is tax deductible to the employer
                               as a salary expense. The employee in turn uses the bonus to pay the premiums on a life insurance policy
                               covering her life. The employee is the owner of the policy, and the bonus is included in the employee’s
                               gross income. When the employee dies, the beneficiary named in the policy receives the death proceeds
                               free of income tax.

                               3.5.3.4 Deferred Compensation Plans
                               Under a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, an employer agrees to pay an employee a stated
                               amount of income beginning at retirement rather than paying the money now. This benefits the
                               employee because the money is not taxable until the employee actually receives it. If the money were
                               paid now, it would be included with the employee’s current earnings and probably taxed at a higher
                               rate. After retirement, the employee may be in a lower tax bracket.

                               In return, the employee agrees to work for the employer until a specified future date—typically at
                               retirement. The deferred compensation benefits are forfeited if the employee leaves the company before
                               then. This benefits the employer by helping to assure that a valuable employee continues to contribute
                               to the company’s success and does not leave to work for a competitor or start a competing business of
                               his or her own.

                               If the employee dies before retirement, the deferred compensation benefits become payable
                               immediately to the employee’s surviving spouse or other beneficiary. Companies often buy a life
                               insurance policy to make sure they will have the money to pay those benefits if that happens. If the
                               policy is permanent insurance, the cash values can be used to help pay the deferred compensation
                               benefits to the employee if he or she lives to retirement.

                               Under the life insurance policy that funds a deferred compensation plan:

                                    ■ the company is owner, premium payer, and beneficiary; and
                                    ■ the employee is the insured.

        3.6        CLASSES OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES
                   Group life insurance is a single contract that covers an entire group of people. Typically, the
                   policyowner is an employer and the policy covers the employees or members of the group. Group life
                   insurance is often provided as part of a complete employee benefit package. In most cases, the cost of
                   group coverage is far less than what the employees or members would pay for an individual policy with
                   similar coverage.

                               Industrial life insurance was developed as a way for people of limited means to obtain some of the
                               benefits of life insurance. The face amounts are usually small—$2,000 or less—and are often bought
                               simply to help pay burial expenses. A distinctive characteristic of industrial policies is that the
                               premiums come due weekly and are collected in person by producers who go door to door.

                               3.6.2 Home Service Life Insurance
                               A variation on industrial life insurance is known as home service life insurance. Home service policies
                               are sold by industrial or home service, producers in the neighborhoods where they collect premiums at
                               the houses of industrial life policyowners. However, the policies are somewhat larger in size, typically
                               ranging from $10,000 to $25,000 in face value. Policyowners are encouraged to pay the premiums
                               through an automatic bank draft (often called a monthly debit plan) or by mail, so that producers do not
                               have to collect them personally.

        3.7        DEVELOPMENT OF LIFE POLICY PREMIUMS

                   3.7.1 Premium Elements
                   Three elements go into the calculation of insurance premiums:

                   Mortality—the relative frequency of deaths in a specific population; death rate.

                   Interest—earnings on premium dollars between the time they are collected and the time they are paid
                   out as claims.

                   Expenses—insurer operating costs, referred to as the expense load. Adding the expense element to
                   insurance premiums is called loading.

                               Net premium is the premium before loading or the mortality element minus the interest element. The
                               net single premium will fund a policy’s benefit with one premium payment.

                                                               Net Premium = Mortality – Interest

                               Gross premium is the net premium plus the expense element, referred to as the loaded premium. The
                               gross annual premium is the amount a policyowner pays for a policy.

                                                        Gross Premium = Mortality – Interest + Expenses

                               The premium payment mode reflects how frequently premiums come due. Premiums may be paid
                               annually, semi-annually, quarterly, or monthly.

                               Premium calculations are based on the assumption that the policyowner will pay the annual premium
                               mode. Premiums will be higher if not paid annually.

                               4.1   INTRODUCTION
                                     Life insurance policies have been designed and molded over three centuries.

                                     Life insurance can be divided into two basic classes: term and permanent policies. Policies that are sold
                                     today have the same fundamental structure as those created years ago. However, insurers continue to
                                     refine their products to meet the demands of a changing society.

                                     This unit explores the basic policies—term, whole life, and universal life—as well as popular hybrids.
                                     You will learn how they work, when they are used, and how they can be customized for special
                                     situations.

                            disadvantages.


        4.3        LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES
                   All life insurance policies pay a benefit upon the death of the insured. The amount of the death benefit
                   is called the face amount because it’s usually found on the first (face) page of the policy. Depending
                   upon the type policy, the actual death benefit payable after the initial purchase of the policy can be
                   equal to, less than or greater than the face amount.

                   Certain types of life insurance policies also offer living benefits – that is, financial benefits that are
                   available while the insured is still alive. The differences between the types of life insurance policies arise
                   from variations in how living and death benefits are provided.


        4.4        TERM INSURANCE

                   4.4.1 Characteristics of Term Insurance
                   Term life insurance is the simplest type of life insurance. Term life insurance policies only offer a death
                   benefit and remain in force for a specified period of time, or term. No death benefit is payable if the
                   insured dies after the term expires.

                   4.4.2 Types of Term Policies
                   4.4.2.1 Level Term
                   The death benefit of a level term policy equals the face amount throughout the term of coverage.
                   The premium also remains level during the term. The policy’s term of coverage may be expressed in
                   reference to either:

                          ■ a number of years, such as 1-year term, 5-year term, 10-year term; 20 year term and 30 year
                            term; or
                          ■ a specified age, such as term to age 65 or term to age 70.

                               4.4.2.2 Decreasing Term
                               The death benefit of a decreasing term policy declines over the coverage period until it reaches zero
                               at the end of the term. Decreasing term is appropriate coverage for financial obligations that decrease
                               steadily over time, like home mortgages, bank loans, or financial obligations that require regular
                               periodic payments.

                               4.4.2.3 Increasing Term
                               The death benefit of an increasing term policy begins near zero and grows over the term of coverage.
                               Increasing term insurance is appropriate to cover financial obligations that increase steadily over time.
                               Increasing term coverage also helps keep life insurance death benefits current with inflation and keep
                               pace with rising cost of living expenses.

                               Return of Premium term policies will return all or a part of the premium paid for the policy if the
                               insured is still alive at the end of the term. The premium for this policy will be higher than a regular
                               term insurance policy, and the premium will also be dependent upon the percentage of premium that
                               will be returned. A 100% return of premium policy would have a higher premium than a 50% return
                               of premium policy, and a return of premium policy would be more expensive than a comparable level
                               term policy.

                   4.4.2.5 Renewability
                   The renewability feature, with term life insurance, guarantees that the policy will renew (extend) at the
                   end of its term. The insured does not have to re-apply or qualify medically for the coverage. The new
                   renewal period will be for the same term as originally purchased. For example, at the end of each five-
                   year renewal period, a 5-year renewable term policy automatically renews for another five years.

                   The renewability feature guarantees the same amount of death benefit, however, the premium for the
                   new renewal period will increase based upon the insured’s age at renewal; the insured’s attained age.

                   The payment of the higher premium at each renewal results in what is called a step-rate premium. The
                   following illustration shows the step-rate premium from age 30 to age 40 for a 1-year renewable term
                   policy or A.R.T. (Annual Renewal Term) contract. The policy automatically renews each year but note
                   that the renewal premium increases each year as the insured ages.

                   A 5-year renewable term policy would have level coverage and premium for 5 years then increase upon
                   renewal for the next 5 years.

                   Renewable term policies expire at an age specified in the policy (e.g., age 65 or 70).

                               4.4.2.6 Convertibility
                               A convertibility feature allows a policyowner to convert a term insurance policy to a permanent type
                               of policy without evidence of insurability and without having to submit an application. The conversion
                               must be made before the term insurance policy expires. The premium for the converted policy will be
                               based on one of two options:

                               Attained age: Insured’s age at time of conversion

                               Original age: Age at the time the original term policy was written. A lump sum amount is required
                               (down payment) that equals what the cash value would have been if a permanent policy was originally
                               purchased instead of the term policy.

                               4.4.3 Advantages and Disadvantages of Term Insurance
                               4.4.3.1 Advantages
                               Because term insurance provides only a death benefit, its premiums are lower than other types of life
                               insurance policies. A term policy is initially the least expensive form of life insurance.

                               4.4.3.2 Disadvantages
                                     ■ Term coverage lasts only for the term of the policy; it’s like renting not owning the policy.
                                     ■ Term premiums increase as the insured gets older.
                                     ■ Renewability features expire before the age of average life expectancy. As a result, individuals may
                                       not be able to obtain or afford coverage at older ages when their risk of dying is greater.

        4.5          WHOLE LIFE INSURANCE

                     4.5.1 Characteristics of Whole Life Insurance
                     Whole Life is a permanent insurance policy which is guaranteed to remain in force for the insured’s
                     entire lifetime (“whole life”) provided the required premiums are paid, or to the policy maturity date.
                     In contrast to term insurance, which becomes unaffordable or unobtainable at older ages, whole life
                     insurance is designed to remain in force for the whole life of the insured and the premiums will never
                     increase.

                     4.5.1.1 Level Premium
                     The purpose of a level premium with whole life policies is to make lifetime coverage affordable at
                     older ages. The level premium system results in overpaying for the risk of dying at younger ages, and
                     underpaying in later years toward the end of life expectancy. As a result the premium amount paid for a
                     whole life policy never increases from its original amount even if the insured lives to a very old age.

                     4.5.1.2 Fixed Premium Schedule
                     The policyowner selects the mode of payment for the policy’s level premium on a fixed schedule.
                     This can be a monthly payment schedule or another mode. If a premium is not paid when it is due, the
                     policy will go out of force, or lapse.

                     4.5.1.3 Fixed, Level Death Benefit
                     Like its premium, the death benefit of a whole life policy is fixed and level. For as long as the policy is
                     in force, the face amount remains the same.

                     4.5.1.4 Cash Value
                     Cash values are an integral part of a whole life policy, and reflect the reserves necessary to assure
                     payment of the guaranteed death benefit.

                               4.5.1.5 Guaranteed Interest Crediting
                               The policy cash value increases steadily over the life of the contract because it is regularly credited with
                               a guaranteed (level) rate of interest. The scheduled increases in the cash value are stated in the policy
                               illustration.

                               4.5.1.6 Policy Surrender
                               The “cash surrender” value of the whole life policy arises from the policyholder’s rights to quit the
                               contract and reclaim a share of the reserve fund attributable to the policy. By cashing in a policy, the
                               policyowner gives up the death benefit.

                               4.5.1.7 Policy Loans
                               Life insurance policies with a cash surrender value usually have loan provisions (policy loan) that allow
                               the policyholder to borrow up to the cash value of the policy. The policy and its death benefit remain in
                               force when cash is loaned and interest must be paid on the amount borrowed.

                               If a policy loan has not been paid back and the insured dies, the amount borrowed plus any interest
                               charges are deducted from the policy’s death benefit.

                               4.5.1.8 Death Benefit Components
                               The whole life policy death benefit is payable upon the insured’s death. The death benefit consists of
                               two components:

                                   1. The cash value, sometimes referred to as the savings element; and
                                   2. An insurance protection element that must be paid in addition to the cash value so that the death
                                      benefit equals the policy’s face amount. This is known as the net amount of risk to the insurance
                                      company, which represents the amount of money the insurer must have on hand to pay the death
                                      benefit. The death benefit equals the cash value plus the net amount at risk at any given time.
                               Cash values increase each year; the insurance protection element decreases each year.

                               Whole life policies mature or endows at some point in the future. A whole life policy usually endows
                               either at age 100 or 120. If the insured is still living when maturity occurs, the cash value in the policy
                               will equal the policy face amount and is paid to the policyowner. At endowment, the policyowner will
                               pay income tax on any taxable gain.

                   4.5.2 Types of Whole Life Policies
                   4.5.2.1 Continuous Premium Whole Life
                   The premiums for this whole life policy are the same each year for the duration of the contract. It is
                   also referred to as straight life or ordinary life. If the policyowner discontinues making premium
                   payments, they will receive the cash value of the policy.

                   4.5.2.2 Limited-Payment Whole Life
                   Limited-payment whole life policies allow for a lifetime of premiums to be paid in a shorter period of
                   time. Common forms of limited payment whole life are:

                           ■ 10-pay or 20-pay whole life; the premiums are payable in 10 or 20 level annual installments, and
                           ■ life paid-up at age 65; premiums are payable in level annual installments from the date of purchase
                             to the year the insured turns 65.
                   Annual premiums for limited payment policies will be higher than continuous payment policies. The
                   premium payments are compressed into a shorter time frame resulting in a higher premium. As with all
                   whole life policies, coverage is for the insured’s entire life.

                   The cash value of a limited payment policy accumulates faster than a continuous premium policy. The
                   cash value of a limited payment policy will continue to earn interest at the guaranteed rate at the end of
                   the premium-paying period, and the policy still endows at age 100 (or 120).

                   This illustration compares the cash value accumulation of a limited payment whole life policy (policy
                   B) to a continuous premium whole life policy (policy A). Both policies have a $50,000 face amount.

                               A single premium whole life policy has one payment made at the time of purchase. The amount of this
                               single premium, along with interest earnings, will cover all future costs of maintaining the policy. Single
                               premium policies create immediate cash value.

                               4.5.2.4 Modified Premium Whole Life
                               Modified premium whole life policies, sometimes called modified whole life policies, have lower
                               premiums during the first three to five years. Compared to a continuous premium whole life policy, in
                               those early years, modified whole life policies have a lower cost similar to term insurance. However,
                               after the initial period, premiums increase to a certain amount and then are level for the life of the
                               policy, making them higher in cost than a continuous premium whole life policy.

                               4.5.2.5 Graded Premium Life Insurance
                               Graded premium whole life policies have an even lower initial premium than modified whole life
                               policies. The graded premium starts out lower than other types of whole life policies and increases
                               every year for five to ten years until leveling off for as long as the policy remains in force.

                               4.5.2.6 Indeterminate Premium
                               An indeterminate premium whole life policy is similar to a nonparticipating whole life policy except
                               that it provides for adjustable premiums. The company will charge a current premium based on its
                               current estimate of investment earnings, mortality, and expense costs. If these estimates change in later
                               years, the company will adjust the premium accordingly but never above the maximum guaranteed
                               premium stated in the policy.

                               4.5.2.7 Interest-Sensitive or Current Assumption Whole Life
                               Interest-sensitive whole life, also known as current assumption whole life is a type of whole life
                               insurance where the cash value can increase beyond the stated guarantee if economic conditions
                               warrant. The interest-sensitive policy has:

                                    ■ a fixed, level death benefit, and
                                    ■ a premium schedule fixed in regard to the timing of payments.
                               With interest sensitive whole life, the insurer will make investments with a percentage of each premium
                               payment. Excess or current interest from those investments may be credited to the policy to make the

                   cash value rise. The interest rate is not fixed for the life of the policy and can fluctuate depending on
                   current economic conditions.

                   Not only can the cash value increase more quickly, but the death benefits can also grow. The primary
                   indicator for any increase is the current economic conditions. The policyowner will be protected from a
                   drop in value below a stated minimum.

                   4.5.3 Advantages and Disadvantages of Whole Life Insurance
                   4.5.3.1 Advantages
                   Whole life insurance is permanent coverage with guaranteed level premiums and it does not expire
                   after a specified term. Cash values in whole life insurance policies accumulate tax deferred. By law
                   permanent policies offer certain options in the event the policy lapses after premiums have been
                   paid into the policy. These values include cash surrender value, paid-up insurance, or extended term
                   insurance.

                   4.5.3.2 Disadvantages
                   Because the policy is providing lifetime coverage, the initial premium for whole life is higher than term
                   insurance. Unlike other types of permanent insurance, whole life premiums cannot be decreased and

        4.6        FLEXIBLE POLICIES

                   4.6.1 Characteristics of Flexible Policies
                   Flexible policies give the policyowner numerous options in terms of premiums, face amounts, and
                   investment objectives. These policy components can be adjusted in response to changing needs and
                   circumstances.

                   4.6.2 Types of Flexible Policies
                   4.6.2.1 Adjustable Life Insurance
                   An adjustable life policy gives the policyowner the options to adjust the face value/death benefit, the
                   premium, and the length of coverage without having to change policies. It also offers the ability to have
                   term and whole life coverage in one policy. The amount of premium that the policyowner can afford is
                   used to determine what type of insurance will best meet their needs.

                   If initially, an individual purchases an adjustable life policy with a large death benefit and low premium,
                   it would operate much like a term insurance. All of the premium would be used to pay the death
                   benefit and nothing would generate cash value. If however the policyowner decided to lower the death
                   benefit, the policy would now accumulate cash value like whole life insurance, assuming no reduction
                   occurred in the premium payment. Increasing the premium without changing the death benefit would
                   accumulate cash value more rapidly, and now the adjustable life policy would perform similar to a
                   whole life policy.

                   4.6.2.2 Universal Life
                   Universal life (UL) was designed for people who want flexible premiums and flexible coverage over
                   the course of their lifetime. UL premiums are flexible, not fixed, like whole life. Premiums paid into a
                   universal life policy accumulate as interest in the policy’s cash value. Monthly interest credited to the
                   cash value is either the guaranteed rate or current rate, whichever is higher. Every month a term cost
                   of insurance and a monthly administrative fee are taken from the cash value by the insurer. As long as
                   there is enough cash value to cover these monthly expenses, the policy will stay in force.

                   The policyowner may increase or decrease the death benefit, subject to any insurability requirements.
                   In addition, the policyowner has the flexibility to choose one of two policy death benefit options.

                   Option A (or Option 1) provides for a level death benefit equal to the policy’s face value. As a result
                   of this choice, more of the premium is placed in the cash account, making the cash value rise more
                   quickly.

                   Option B (or Option 2) provides for an increasing death benefit equal to the face value of the policy plus
                   the cash account. Cash value does not increase as quickly because more of the premium is applied to
                   the higher cost of the increasing death benefit over the life of the policy.

                   Withdrawals and loans may be made against the cash value account. The policyowner can also
                   surrender or “cash in” the universal life contract for its current cash value whenever he or she wishes.

                   These illustrations depict how each death benefit options works. The corridor at the right of the Option
                   A illustration shows an automatic increase in the amount of insurance protection required under the
                   tax law when policies accumulate a high proportion of cash value compared to the death benefit.

                               Both whole life and universal life allow policy loans from the cash value. However, only universal life
                               allows withdrawals (partial surrenders) from the cash value. Withdrawals reduce the cash value and the
                               death benefit by the amount of the withdrawal. A withdrawal is federal income tax-free up to the cost
                               basis (i.e., premiums paid). Withdrawals above the cost basis are taxed as ordinary income. Unlike a
                               policy loan, withdrawals do not require repayment.

                               4.6.2.3 Equity-Indexed Universal Life Insurance
                               Equity-indexed universal life is a permanent life insurance policy that allows policyholders to
                               tie accumulation values to a stock market index such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. Indexed
                               universal life typically contains a minimum guaranteed interest rate component along with the indexed
                               account option. Indexed policies give policyholders the security of fixed universal life insurance with
                               the growth potential of the underlying market index.

                               Unlike the interest-bearing investments that support most life insurance policies, stocks have no stated
                               rate of return and may even lose value. However, the downside protection of equity-indexed universal
                               life policies guarantee that the interest credited to the cash value will never be below zero.

                   4.6.3 Advantages and Disadvantages of Flexible Policies
                   4.6.3.1 Advantages
                   Adjustable life combines the guarantees of whole life insurance with the affordable premiums of term
                   insurance in one policy. The policyowner is allowed to adjust the mix of whole life and term based on his
                   desire for affordable premiums and cash value growth.

                   Universal life’s flexible premium means that policyowners can skip premiums without losing their coverage
                   when money is tight, as long as there is enough cash value to cover the policy’s monthly expenses. The
                   flexible death benefit allows the policyowner to adjust the death benefit as his life changes. Withdrawals
                   allow access to the policy cash values without the requirement to pay it back.

                   Equity-indexed life insurance provides the upside potential of the underlying index with the downside
                   guarantee that the interest crediting rate to the cash value will never be below zero.

                                     Unlike whole life or term insurance, these policies are more complex. It is important the policyowner
                                     understand that premium payment amounts, interest rates, withdrawals, and death benefit changes can
                                     significantly impact the policy’s long-term benefits.

                                     4.7.1 Characteristics of Variable Policies
                                     Variable policies are permanent insurance policies designed to provide lifetime coverage for the
                                     insured and have cash value and a death benefit. The major advantage of variable policies is that they
                                     allow the policyowner to participate in various types of options while not being taxed on the earnings
                                     until the policy is surrendered.

                                     The separate account is a fund held by the life insurance company and maintained separately from the
                                     insurer’s general assets. This account is established to hold variable annuity and variable life insurance
                                     premiums used to purchase funds/investments that the company offers. This account is distinct from
                                     the general account established to hold insurer assets and premiums for their fixed insurance products.

                   4.7.1.2 Policyowner Choice of Separate Account Investments
                   The number and type of investment choices available to the policyowner varies from company to
                   company, and from policy to policy. Most companies have suggested model portfolios to simplify the
                   policyowner’s selection for the variable policy.

                   4.7.1.3 No Guaranteed Rate of Return and Risk of Loss
                   Separate account investment options usually include a mixture of stocks, bonds, mutual funds, money
                   market instruments, and even commodities. Although investment performance is not guaranteed,
                   it can provide higher rates of return than the guaranteed or current rates paid on other traditional
                   insurance policies.

                   4.7.1.4 Variable Insurance: Producer/Agent Registration
                   Variable insurance is an insurance product that contains an investment element. For this reason, both
                   the securities industry and state insurance commissioners regulate these policies.

                          ■ Agents selling variable policies must have a valid life insurance license. An additional variable
                            products license is required in some states.
                          ■ To sell investment products, agents must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission
                            (SEC) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Association (FINRA). Exams are required to obtain
                            the necessary licenses.

                   4.7.2 Types of Variable Policies
                   4.7.2.1 Variable Life
                   Variable life insurance has a separate account instead of guaranteed cash value. It’s also called variable
                   whole life or fixed-premium variable life.

                   Variable universal life policies have two death benefit options like the universal life policy. Death
                   benefit Option A (or Option 1) remains level regardless of increases or decreases in the cash value,
                   while death benefit Option B (or Option 2) varies with the fluctuating cash values.

                   The death benefit of a variable life policy will increase with positive investment results however in the
                   event of negative performance, it cannot decrease below the original face amount. The original face
                   amount is the variable life policy guaranteed minimum death benefit.

                   This illustrates the variable life death benefit.

                                4.7.2.2 Variable Universal Life
                                Variable life is whole life with a separate account. Variable universal life is universal life with a separate
                                account. Variable universal life is also called flexible premium variable life.

                                Variable universal life is a type of permanent life insurance, because the death benefit will be paid if the
                                insured dies any time as long as there is sufficient cash value to pay the costs of insurance in the policy.
                                A VUL policy can lapse if the cash value falls below the amount needed to cover the monthly insurance
                                premiums this means it does not have a guaranteed minimum death benefit.

                                Variable universal life policies have two death benefit options like the UL policy. Option 1 remains level
                                regardless of increases or decreases in the cash value and the Option 2 death benefit varies with the
                                fluctuating cash value.

                                                                                                       Variable Policies

                                4.7.3 Advantages and Disadvantages of Variable Policies
                                4.7.3.1 Advantages
                                Variable policies offer the potential of higher returns than the guaranteed rates paid on traditional
                                life insurance products. Investment-based returns have the potential to keep pace with inflation and
                                because of the tax-deferred feature they may offer an attractive tax advantage for those in higher
                                income brackets.

                                4.7.3.2 Disadvantages
                                Variable policies have no guaranteed rate of return. The policies are complicated and can be difficult
                                to understand. Variable policies are highly regulated by both federal and state agencies. An important
                                provision of federal laws requires producers to provide customers with a prospectus—a document
                                containing a detailed description of the product being offered—before beginning a sales presentation.

        4.8          SPECIALIZED POLICIES

                     4.8.1 Joint Life Policies
                     A joint life policy usually covers two or more lives with the death benefit being paid when the first
                     insured dies. For this reason, they are also called first-to-die policies. Once the death benefit is paid out,
                     the policy ends.

                     A first-to-die policy may be the right product for married people who want a surviving spouse to be
                     able to maintain a certain lifestyle but they want to pay less than the cost of two individual policies. Or
                     a retired couple living on income from both of their pension plans would be ideal candidates for this
                     policy. When either spouse dies, the other will only have their own pension benefit to live on and the
                     joint life policy death benefit would now supplement their retirement income.

                     4.8.2 Survivorship Policies
                     A survivorship life policy insures two individuals and will pay the death benefit when the last insured
                     dies. Survivorship policies are also called second-to-die or last-to-die policies. A survivorship policy
                     costs less than purchasing two individual policies. This policy can provide money to pay estate
                     settlement costs and related expenses upon the death of a second spouse.

                     4.8.3 Juvenile Policies
                     Juvenile life insurance is coverage written on the life of a child or a minor. Juvenile policies are most
                     often permanent life insurance. In addition to the death benefit, juvenile life insurance provides
                     the benefit of locking in the low premium for the child’s entire life, and guarantees the child has life
                     insurance in case their health changes in the future.

                     The death benefit of a juvenile policy may seem too small when the child is grown up. To address
                     this, the face amount of some juvenile policies automatically increases when the child reaches age 18
                     or 21, with no corresponding increase in premium. These are called jumping juvenile policies. In some

                                5.1   INTRODUCTION
                                      Life insurance is not a one size fits all solution; life insurance riders are benefit options to tailor a policy
                                      to the owner’s needs.

                                      The total price for purchasing a new car will reflect the upgraded tires and fog lights requested by the
                                      owner. Adding a rider to a life policy is just like customizing a car, purchasing a rider will increase the
                                      premium on the policy.

                                      This unit will discuss the most common insurance policy riders including the waiver of premium, the
                                      accidental death benefit—commonly referred to as “double indemnity”—the guaranteed insurability
                                      rider.

                                      An agent/producer must follow the “know your customer” rule by understanding the customer’s
                                      current situation and budget and then recommending the most appropriate policy rider(s).

                          ӽ define riders;
                          ӽ identify disability riders including waiver of premium, waiver of monthly deductions, waiver of
                            cost of insurance, disability income rider, and the payor benefit rider;

                          ӽ identify the Other Insured Riders and exchange privilege (substitute insured) riders;

                          ӽ describe the long term care rider.


        5.3        LIFE POLICY RIDERS
                   Riders add benefits to a life insurance policy. They customize coverage to fit the insured’s needs.
                   Policyowners are charged an additional premium for certain types of riders.


        5.4        DISABILITY RIDERS

                   5.4.1 Waiver of Premium
                   This is one of the most common types of life insurance riders. If the policyholder becomes disabled, the
                   waiver of premium rider will pay the premiums so the policyholder can continue to have coverage for
                   the duration of the policy. The policy stays in force during the period of disability, and scheduled policy
                   cash values continue to be credited.

                   The insured must be unable to work for a certain period, called the waiting period, before the waiver
                   takes effect. The waiting period is usually 90 to 180 days. If the insured is still disabled at the end of the
                   waiting period, the company retroactively refunds any premiums paid during the waiting period.

                   The definition of disabled often changes after a period of time to the inability to work at any job that fits
                   with the insured’s education, training, or experience.

                   The waiver of premium rider is available during the insured’s working years and expires between ages
                   of 60 and 65. However, if an insured becomes permanently disabled before that age, premiums will
                   continue to be waived for life.

                   5.4.1.1 Disability Waiver for Flexible Premium Policies
                   The disability premium waiver for flexible premium policies, such as universal life, suspends the
                   monthly cost of insurance deductions that are made from the cash account instead of waiving the
                   premium payment. For this reason, the disability waiver for flexible premium policies is called waiver
                   of monthly deductions or waiver of cost of insurance.

                   A flexible premium policy cannot lapse while the waiver of monthly deductions benefit is in effect and
                   cash values continue to grow with the interest that is credited monthly.

                                Disability waiver for flexible premium policies also has a three- to six-month waiting period and
                                expires between the ages of 60 and 65.

                                5.4.2 Disability Income Rider
                                The disability income rider provides the insured with a monthly benefit check if they become disabled.

                                The benefit amount is typically based on the life insurance policy death benefit and an industry
                                standard is 1% of the face value. The length of time that income payments will continue depends on the
                                definition of disability in the policy.

                                During the time that premiums are waived, the life insurance policy stays in force, so that if the insured
                                dies, the beneficiary receives the face value of the policy. Cash values continue to build, and if the policy
                                is participating, dividends continue to be paid.

                   5.4.3 Payor Benefit Rider
                   The payor benefit rider is usually found with juvenile policies. This provision states that if the person
                   responsible for the premiums, for example the child’s parents, becomes disabled or dies before the
                   child legally becomes an adult, the rest of the premiums are waived until the child reaches a stated age,
                   usually 18 or 21. Since this rider adds insurance on the payor (the adult), medical underwriting may be
                   required.

                                5.5   ACCELERATED BENEFITS RIDER
                                      An accelerated death benefit rider is a standard coverage added to a life insurance policy that enables
                                      the policyowner to apply for an advance on the death benefit proceeds during the lifetime of the
                                      insured. The insured must have a limited life expectancy or meet certain medical circumstances in
                                      order to be eligible for an advanced payment of all or a portion of a life insurance policy’s death benefit.

                                      5.5.1 Qualifying Events
                                      An accelerated death benefit payment can be requested when the insured has limited life expectancy or
                                      meets certain medical circumstances including:

                                             ■ terminal illness, with death expected within 24 months;
                                             ■ serious illness, such as cancer, which would result in a reduced life expectancy;
                                             ■ long-term care due to the inability to perform a number of the activities of daily living;
                                             ■ being admitted to hospice or permanent confinement in a nursing home; or
                                             ■ catastrophic illness requiring extraordinary treatment, such as an organ transplant.

                                      5.5.2 Reduction of Death Benefit
                                      Accelerated death benefit payments range from 25–100% of the death benefit. The payment depends
                                      on the policy’s face value, the terms of the contract, and the state of residence. The amount of the
                                      accelerated payment will be reduced by any outstanding loans against the policy and the death benefit
                                      is reduced by the amount of the accelerated benefit payment.

                                      5.5.3 Disclosure
                                      A written disclosure including, but not necessarily limited to, a brief description of the accelerated
                                      benefit and definitions of the conditions or occurrences triggering payment of the benefits shall be
                                      given to the applicant. The description shall include an explanation of any effect of the payment of a
                                      benefit on the policy’s cash value, accumulation account, death benefit, premium, policy loans and
                                      policy liens.

                                5.6   RIDERS FOR OTHER INSUREDS

                                      5.6.1 Other (Additional) Insured Term Riders
                                      Other (additional) insured riders provide convertible term insurance for a spouse or an immediate
                                      family member of the primary insured. This rider is called a spouse rider or a children’s rider.

                                      A family rider covers both the insured’s spouse and children. Other insured riders can also be bought
                                      for certain non-family individuals such as business associates. The term insurance coverage provided
                                      by the other (additional) insured rider is often convertible to permanent coverage during the effective
                                      period of the rider.

                                      5.6.2 Exchange Privilege (Substitute Insured) Riders
                                      The exchange privilege rider also called the substitute insured rider is used to change the insured to a
                                      different person. This rider is typically used when a business owns the policy and is also the beneficiary
                                      and the insured is a key employee. This rider switches the insured to another employee if the key
                                      employee retires or leaves the company. The policy’s face amount stays the same and premiums are
                                      adjusted based on the new insured’s age and other rating factors. The new insured is required to provide
                                      proof of insurability (submit to a medical examination).

                                5.7   RIDERS AFFECTING THE DEATH BENEFIT

                                      5.7.1 Term Rider on the Insured
                                      The insured can add term insurance to a permanent insurance policy using the term insurance rider. It
                                      provides coverage similar to a term insurance policy however the premium is lower than purchasing a
                                      separate policy.

                                      In the event of insured’ death, both the term insurance rider and the underlying permanent insurance
                                      policy’s death benefit would be paid to the named beneficiary.

                   The term rider expires at a specified age or after a certain number of years. The premium for the rider is
                   paid while it’s in force.

                   5.7.2 Return of Premium
                   The return of premium rider is an increasing term rider; the death benefit always equals the total of
                   premiums paid for the rider and the underlying permanent policy. The rider does not return the actual
                   premiums but pays an additional term insurance death benefit that equals the amount of premiums
                   paid. Term riders have a limited duration and expire at a specified age or after a specified number of
                   years.

                             5.7.3 Accidental Death Benefit (ADB)
                             The accidental death benefit (ADB) rider pays an extra benefit if the insured dies as the result of an
                             accident. This rider is sometimes referred to as double or triple indemnity because the death benefit is
                             twice or three times the face amount of the policy.

                             For the extra benefit to be payable, the insured must die within 90 days of an accident. The extra benefit
                             is only payable if the insured’s death was the result of an accident. The ADB rider does not cover other
                             causes of death like:

                                    ■ illness,
                                    ■ disability, or
                                    ■ self-inflicted injury or suicide.
                             Also excluded from coverage is death resulting from:

                                    ■ war,
                                    ■ commission of crimes, or
                                    ■ aviation activities other than on a commercial flight.
                             This rider usually expires when the insured reaches age 60 or 65.

                             5.7.3.1 Accidental Death and Dismemberment (AD&D)
                             Accidental death and dismemberment insurance, also known as AD&D insurance, is supplementary
                             coverage that can be added to traditional life insurance policies. In addition to paying an extra benefit if
                             the insured dies as the result of an accident, the accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D) rider
                             also pays an extra benefit if the insured lives after suffering a severe dismemberment. The AD&D rider
                             has a stated amount of coverage.

                             If a policyholder dies as a direct result of an accident, a full death benefit will be paid out to the policy’s
                             beneficiary. If the policy amount is for $100,000, the benefit will be $100,000. If the policyholder does
                             not die as a result of the accident and instead loses a limb, he/she will receive a 50% benefit payout.
                             Losing two or more limbs would compound for a full benefit payment.

                   The principal sum is the amount of the rider and 100% of the death benefit is paid upon accidental
                   death of the insured

                   The capital sum is the dismemberment benefit and is 50% or ½ of the principal sum. Dismemberment
                   includes:

                   5.7.4 Guaranteed Insurability
                   The guaranteed insurability rider (GIR)—also called a guaranteed-insurability option (GIO) or a
                   guaranteed-insurability benefit (GIB)—may be attached to a permanent life insurance policy and
                   allows the owner to purchase additional life insurance at specified intervals in the future for certain
                   amounts without having to provide evidence of insurability. Options to purchase may be exercised
                   typically between ages 25 and 40 at 3-year intervals. The insurance is available at standard rates and
                   must be exercised within 90 days of the listed option date.

                   When this rider is added to a policy, the current age of the insured determines the number of options
                   available to purchase additional insurance. Example: At age 25 the insured would have five options
                   available at ages 28, 31, 34, 37, and 40. A 34-year old insured would only have two options available at
                   ages 37 and 40.

                                5.7.5 Cost of Living
                                The Cost of Living rider is based on the Consumer Price Index (CPI). As inflation increases, so does
                                the death benefit of the policy. For example, if an insured had a $100,000 policy and the Consumer
                                Price Index increased by 2%, at the end of the year, the insured’s death benefit would increase to
                                $102,000. The premium for the additional coverage would be based on the insured’s attained age. If the
                                CPI decreases, the insured’s coverage is not reduced.

        5.8        LONG-TERM CARE RIDER
                   There are two approaches to the LTC rider concept. The independent approach recognizes the LTC
                   benefit as independent from the life policy because the benefits paid to the insured will not affect the
                   life policy’s face amount or cash value. The integrated approach links the LTC benefits paid to the life
                   policy’s face amount and/or cash value. Similar to the accelerated benefits rider, the LTC rider may be
                   used to pay for qualified services such as home care, assisted living, or nursing home care.

                   The long-term care rider may offer benefits consistent with the benefits offered by a stand-alone long-
                   term care policy. Because of this special rider, the insured can elect to use all, some, or none of their life
                   insurance benefit—while they are still living to help pay for long-term care expenses.

                   While evidence of insurability is necessary for underwriting, some insurance companies may also offer
                   simplified one-page applications.

                                6.1   INTRODUCTION
                                      Life insurance is the foundation of any financial plan. It protects an individual’s goals and can take care
                                      of loved ones if the breadwinner dies unexpectedly. But the value of life insurance goes beyond risk
                                      protection, it can be an asset and offer other financial benefits at various stages during the life of the
                                      insured.

                                      Term and permanent life policies have the primary function of providing a death benefit. Permanent
                                      insurance offers additional financial benefits throughout the insured’s lifetime, and participating
                                      policies may pay dividends to a policyowner.

                                      This unit focuses on “living benefits,” how can the cash value and/or dividends be used during the
                                      insured’s lifetime, and “settlement options,” what choices are available to a beneficiary upon the death of
                                      the insured.




                                                                                                                                               129

                6.2             LEARNING OBJECTIVES

                      After successfully completing this lesson, you should be able to:

                          ӽ explain the seven settlement options: interest only, fixed period, fixed amount, life income, life
                            with period certain, life with refund certain, and joint-and-survivor life;
                          ӽ describe the insureds access to cash values through policy loans, withdrawals, and partial
                            surrenders;
                          ӽ explain policy dividends and the six dividend options: cash, reduced premium, accumulation at
                            interest, paid up additions, paid up insurance, and one year term insurance; and
                          ӽ identify the three nonforfeiture options: cash surrender, reduced paid up insurance, and extended
                            term insurance.


        6.3        LIFE INSURANCE POLICY OPTIONS
                   All life insurance policies have a death benefit and the settlement options are used to determine how
                   the proceeds will be distributed to the beneficiary(s).

                   Permanent life contracts accumulate cash value and policies issued by participating policies may pay
                   dividends to a policyowner. The policyowner can choose how to use these “living benefits.”

                   Nonforeiture options give permanent life insurance policyowners alternatives for using cash value if the
                   policyowner wants to change the existing policy.

                   This section details the use of these important elements of a life insurance policy.


        6.4        SETTLEMENT OPTIONS
                   The life insurance policyowner may designate a specific settlement option to be paid upon his or her
                   death. If the policyowner does not indicate a specific option, the death benefits are distributed as a
                   lump sum. Settlement options include interest income only option, fixed period option, fixed amount
                   option, life income option, life with period certain, life with refund certain, and joint and survivor life.
                   Please see the following sections for explanations of each of these options.

                   6.4.1 Interest Income (Only) Option
                   Under the interest income (only) settlement option, the insurer retains the death benefit and pays a
                   stated amount of interest on the money. The interest is paid to the beneficiary at regular intervals.

                   This could be a good choice for those who do not need the life insurance proceeds until a later date,
                   perhaps to be used for a child’s future education expenses.

                                6.4.2 Fixed Period Option
                                The fixed period option will pay both an amount of principal and interest to the beneficiary over a
                                certain stated period of time. Should the policy’s primary beneficiary die before all of the proceeds are
                                paid out, the remainder of the money will be paid to the contingent beneficiary that was named in the
                                policy. Three factors are used to calculate each payment:

                                     1. Amount of death benefit;
                                     2. A guaranteed interest rate; and
                                     3. The length of the chosen period.

                   6.4.3 Fixed Amount Option
                   With the fixed amount settlement option, the proceeds will be paid out in a fixed amount over time
                   until both the principal and interest have been completely paid to the beneficiary. The recipient of the
                   payments has the ability to either increase or decrease the payment amount and if they choose, they
                   could also even change to a different settlement option altogether. Three factors are used to determine
                   the minimum length of the payment period:

                         1. Amount of death benefit;
                         2. A guaranteed interest rate; and
                         3. The chosen payment amount.
                   If interest exceeding the guaranteed rate is earned, the money will last longer than expected. It will
                   increase the length of the payment period, not the size of the payment amount. If the beneficiary dies
                   before the money runs out, payments may continue to another person or the remaining funds will be
                   paid into the beneficiary’s estate.

                                6.4.4 Life Income Option
                                The life income option is similar to an annuity; the policy beneficiary will be guaranteed to receive an
                                income for the rest of their life, regardless of how long that may be. The actual amount of the income
                                depends on the policy death benefit and the life expectancy of the beneficiary; their age and gender.
                                The beneficiary can select to receive the entire annuity payout until they die or share it with another
                                individual.

                                The choices for the annuity are life only option, life with period certain, life with refund, or joint and
                                survivor life.

                                6.4.5 Life Only Option
                                The life only or straight life option will pay the largest amount to the beneficiary for as long as they live,
                                regardless of how long that may be. Upon their death no further payments are made.

                   6.4.6 Life With Period Certain
                   Life with period certain also pays an income for as long as the beneficiary is alive. However, the
                   beneficiary selects a payment period, typically 5, 10, or 20 years can be chosen, and payments are
                   guaranteed to be made for at least that number of years. If the beneficiary dies before the end of the
                   selected period, payments continue to another person for the rest of the payment period.

                   6.4.8 Joint-and-Survivor Life
                   The joint-and-survivor life settlement option continues paying a benefit for as long as either
                   beneficiary lives. This option is often used when a married couple will be receiving the payments.

                   After the death of the first beneficiary, the same or a reduced payment amount is paid to the survivor.
                   Selecting a reduced payment for the second beneficiary will allow a larger payment while both
                   beneficiaries are alive.

                                6.5   ACCESS TO CASH VALUES

                                      6.5.1 Policy Loans
                                      Permanent life insurance policies have two components, the death benefit or face value and cash value – the
                                      savings element funded by a portion of the premium. If the policyowner needs cash but does not want to
                                      surrender their policy, they can access the cash value that is available using the policy loan provision.

                                      The main advantages of a policy loan over other loans is that there is no credit check; the interest rate
                                      is usually much lower; the policyholder can pay back the loan according to virtually any repayment
                                      schedule; and, in fact, the policyholder is not even legally obligated to pay back the loan. The value
                                      of the life insurance policy is reduced while the loan is outstanding. If death occurs while the loan is
                                      outstanding, then the insurance proceeds are reduced by the amount of the loan outstanding plus interest.

                   When the policy loan and the accumulated interest exceed the cash value of the policy, it lapses.

                   Some policies have an automatic premium loan provision. If the insured fails to pay the policy
                   premium by the end of the grace period, then the insurer will pay the premium with a policy loan and
                   will continue to do so until the cash value of the policy falls below the premium amount, in which case,
                   the policy will lapse.

                   6.5.2 Withdrawals and Partial Surrenders
                   A loan is a sum you borrow and use your policy as collateral. Loans are subject to loan interest and
                   any unpaid loan will be deducted from the death benefit upon the insured person’s death. Loans may
                   be repaid at any time while the policy is in force. Withdrawals, or partial surrenders, are allowed on
                   universal life insurance policies but not whole life policies. A withdrawal will result in a reduction of
                   the cash value and the death benefit amount. A withdrawal may be subject to a pro-rata surrender
                   charge and/or processing fee. A withdrawal cannot be repaid.

                                                                                       Access to Cash Values While Insured

        6.6        POLICY DIVIDENDS

                   6.6.1 Source of Policy Dividends
                   Life insurance policies that pay policy dividends are referred to as participating policies. Life policies
                   that do not pay policy dividends are referred to as nonparticipating policies. Policy dividends are a
                   refund of a portion of the premium. Dividends are based on the difference between the gross premium
                   charged and the actual experience of the insurer. Dividends are not guaranteed. Because policy
                   dividends are a return of premium, they are not taxable.

                                6.6.2 Dividend Options
                                Use the acronym CARPPO to remember the dividend options:

                                6.6.2.1 Cash
                                The insurer can send a check to the policyowner in the amount of the dividend.

                                6.6.2.2 Accumulation at Interest
                                The dividend can be left with the insurer to earn interest in a savings account. The dividend is not
                                taxable, however the interest credited to the account is taxable.

                                6.6.2.3 Reduced Premium
                                The dividend can be applied and reduce the next premium due.

                                6.6.2.4 Paid Up Additions
                                The paid-up additions option uses each annual dividend to purchase an additional amount of life
                                insurance. The result of a paid-up addition is a larger amount of life insurance. In turn, each paid-up
                                addition builds its own cash value and also earns dividends. The cash value build-up is tax-deferred
                                under the tax rules for life insurance cash value.

                                6.6.2.5 Paid Up Insurance
                                Dividends plus interest on dividends are applied to the annual premium and are enough to pay the
                                entire annual premium. In a high interest rate environment, this may allow the policyowner to not
                                have to pay premiums out-of-pocket. Since dividends are not guaranteed, a producer cannot tell a
                                policyowner the policy is “paid up.”

                                6.6.2.6 One-Year Term Insurance
                                The dividend may be used to buy one-year term insurance equal to the policy’s cash value.

        6.7        NONFORFEITURE OPTIONS
                   The nonforfeiture clause in an insurance policy allows for the insured to receive all or a portion of the
                   benefits or a partial refund on the premiums paid if the insured misses premium payments, causing the
                   policy to lapse.

                   There are three nonforfeiture options:
                          ■ Cash surrender—the policy is canceled and the policyowner receives the current cash value.
                          ■ Reduced paid-up insurance—Under this option, the policyowner obtains a reduced amount of
                            paid-up whole life insurance based the insured’s attained age and the amount of guaranteed cash
                            value available to buy a single premium policy. The policy will pay the reduced death benefit
                            whenever the insured dies.
                          ■ Extended term insurance—The net cash surrender value is used to buy a term insurance policy with
                            a death benefit the same as the original whole life policy and is based on the insured’s attained age.
                            The policy will terminate after a stated number of years found in the non-forfeiture table. If the
                            policyowner fails to select one of the nonforfeiture options when premium payments cease, this
                            option generally goes into effect automatically.

                                      Provisions were created to protect the interests of one or both parties named in a contract or legal
                                      document. A life insurance policy is a legal document, and as such it can be somewhat intimidating.

                                      The life insurance industry is highly regulated and policies contain many standard provisions that
                                      explain how the policy works and define the parties involved in the contract and their rights, privileges,
                                      and obligations. The common policy provisions provide more details and include the free look clause,
                                      grace period, suicide and incontestability clause, policy loans, and others that enhance or limit a policy
                                      and impose duties on the owner and beneficiary.

                                      This unit discusses the various provisions, important terms, and conditions in life insurance policies.

        7.3          LIFE INSURANCE POLICY PROVISIONS
                     The terms of a life insurance policy are spelled out in its provisions or clauses. They describe how
                     certain common situations will be handled, as well as the rights and the obligations of the policyowner
                     and the insurer.

                     Life insurance provisions have been standardized for the most part, so every policy contains these
                     contractual provisions.


        7.4          STANDARD PROVISIONS

                     7.4.1 Free Look
                     The free look, or right to examine, provision gives the policyowner a period of time to return a policy
                     for any reason within ten days of delivery and receive all premiums paid. The policy will be considered
                     null and void.

                                The insuring clause or insuring agreement sets forth the insurer’s promise to pay benefits upon the
                                insured’s death. It includes what the company will pay, the death benefit amount, and to whom it will be
                                paid. An authorized officer of the company signs this clause.

                   7.4.4 Assignment
                   Assignment of life insurance is a transfer of the owner’s rights, in whole or part, to another individual
                   or entity.

                   There are two types of assignment.

                         1. Collateral assignment (temporary or conditional assignment) does not change ownership of the
                            policy. The most common type of partial assignment is to pledge all or part of the death benefit
                            as collateral for a loan.
                         2. Absolute or permanent assignment of a policy transfers all rights of ownership to another person
                            or entity. Example: a parent may transfer policyownership to a daughter when she reaches age 18.

                                7.4.5 Entire Contract
                                The life insurance policy and a copy of the original application constitute the entire contract.

                                The provision states “no statement shall void this policy or be used in defense of a claim under it unless
                                contained in the application.”

                                This reinforces the idea that the policy itself constitutes the entire contract along with a copy of the
                                original application. The insurer may not refer to documents other than these when denying or paying
                                a claim.

                                Endorsements or any change made to the contract must be made in writing and agreed to by both the
                                insurer and the policyowner. This amendment must be signed by an executive officer of the company

                   7.4.7 Consideration
                   Consideration is a legal term meaning something of value. An exchange of value is necessary to form
                   a valid contract. The insured’s consideration is the premium paid and the representations made in the
                   application. The insurer’s consideration is the promise to pay the face amount of the contract to the
                   named beneficiary upon the death of the insured.

                   7.4.8 Payment of Premium
                   The payment of premium provision states that premiums are due in advance—that is, on or before
                   the date on which the next period of coverage begins. The mode of the premium payment is frequency
                   of the payment. Modes of payment are annually, semi-annually, quarterly, and monthly. Premium
                   payment amounts can be either level, single payment, graded, or flexible.

                   7.4.9 Grace Period
                   If the insured does not pay the premium on date when due, the policy will stay in force for a limited
                   time before the coverage actually lapses. This is the policy’s grace period and lasts for a period of up to
                   31 days.

                                If the insured dies during the grace period, the policy will pay the death benefit minus the amount of
                                the past due premium as of the date of death.

                                7.4.10 Reinstatement
                                Reinstatement is the restoration of a lapsed policy as originally purchased. Permanent life policies
                                permit reinstatement in nearly all cases. The insured will receive the protection of the original policy, if
                                the policy has not been surrendered for cash, and they do the following:

                                       ■ submits an application for reinstatement within three years of lapse;
                                       ■ pay all past due premiums, with interest; and,
                                       ■ provides satisfactory evidence of insurability (medical examination)
                                The premium for the reinstated policy will be the same as the original. A reinstated policy usually starts
                                a new contestability period (two years); but it does not require a new suicide period.

                   7.4.11 Incontestability
                   The incontestability provision is provided to protect the insured. It states that after a life insurance
                   policy has been in effect for two years the company cannot claim that a statement made in the
                   application for insurance was meant to defraud the insurer.
                   The first two years of a policy are known as the contestable period. The insured might be required to
                   substantiate statements in application during this period.
                   If a policy has been reinstated after lapse, a new contestability period begins but it only applies to
                   information given on the reinstatement application, not the information given when the policy was
                   originally purchased.

                   7.4.12 Suicide Clause
                   The suicide clause states that if an insured, whether sane or insane, commits suicide during the first two
                   years after a life insurance contract has been issued, the company will pay only the premium paid by the
                   insured, not the face amount of the policy. Once the policy has been in effect for two years, an insured’s
                   suicide will result in payment of the full-face amount of the policy. Suicide is excluded from accidental
                   death benefits.

                                7.4.13 Misstatement of Age
                                The incontestability clause previously discussed does not pertain to an insured’s misstatement
                                regarding age. If a deceased insured misrepresented their age, the face amount of the policy will be
                                adjusted to an amount the premium would have purchased at the insured’s correct age, at the time of
                                purchase of the policy.

                                For example, if an insured claimed to be 30 years old when in fact they were 40 years old, the $50,000
                                policy purchased would be adjusted to a lower face amount in the event of his/her death. If the insured
                                claimed to be 30 years old when in fact he/she was 20 years old, the $50,000 policy purchased would be
                                adjusted to a higher face amount.

                                If a misstatement of age is discovered while the insured is alive, this mistake will be rectified usually at
                                the insured’s option.

                                When a misstatement of sex occurs the face amount of a policy will be adjusted in a similar way.

                                The payment of claims provision says the insurer will pay the death benefit promptly. The insurance
                                company is generally required to pay a death claim within 60 days (two months) after receiving
                                notification of the claim. If the claim payment is made more than 60 days after notification of the claim,
                                interest must be paid.

                                7.5   BENEFICIARIES
                                      The policyowner names the beneficiary—the person or entity who will get the death benefit.

                                      7.5.1 Who Can Be a Beneficiary?
                                      Almost any person or other legal entity can be the beneficiary of a life insurance policy. A beneficiary is
                                      defined as a “person or interest” to whom payment of life insurance policy proceeds will be made upon
                                      the death of the insured.

                                      For each type of beneficiary, certain considerations need to be kept in mind.

                                      7.5.1.1 Individuals
                                      An individual or a class of persons can be named beneficiary. Each type must have an insurable interest
                                      in the insured when the policy is originally purchased.

                                      If a specific individual is intended to receive benefits, it is important that he or she be clearly identified
                                      by name, preferably including the person’s middle name or at least middle initial. For example, a
                                      designation of “my spouse” would cause confusion if the policyowner gets divorced and remarried.

                                      If two or more beneficiaries are named, the policyowner needs to define how the benefits are to be
                                      shared among them. Any division is acceptable. If no division is given, the beneficiary provisions of
                                      most policies say that the benefits will be paid in equal shares.

                                      7.5.1.2 Classes
                                      Life insurance beneficiaries can be designated by classes. For example, “my children” or “my siblings”
                                      are class designations. Class beneficiaries need not be identified by name.

                                      7.5.1.3 Trusts
                                      A trust is a legal entity which can hold title to property while it is managed for the benefit of others.
                                      There are three parties to a trust.

                                          1. The grantor is the individual who sets up the trust, transfers property into it, and writes the
                                             instructions as to how the trust will operate.
                                          2. The trustee is the party that manages the property according to the grantor’s instructions. The
                                             trustee may be an individual or another legal entity such as a bank.
                                          3. The beneficiary is the person who receives the benefits of the trust.

                   Trusts can be set up for multiple reasons; they are generally designated to receive life insurance
                   proceeds in order to allow someone to enjoy the benefit of those proceeds without giving them
                   ownership. This is commonly done when the beneficiary may not be capable of managing a large sum
                   of money.

                   7.5.1.4 Minors
                   A minor is a person under age 18 and is deemed legally incompetent, therefore they cannot take
                   ownership of life insurance proceeds. Paying the proceeds to a trustee or guardian who is legally
                   entitled to receive and manage such funds on behalf of the minor is a valid beneficiary arrangement.
                   However, the insurer may be instructed to hold the death proceeds and credit interest until the minor
                   attains legal/majority age.

                   7.5.1.5 Estates
                   The insured’s estate may be designated as beneficiary and used to pay debts and the costs of legally
                   closing the estate. After the estate’s debts are paid, the remaining proceeds will be distributed to the
                   insured’s heirs along with the estate’s other assets.

                   Life insurance proceeds paid into an estate are counted toward the total value of the estate for estate tax
                   purposes.

                   between per capita and per stirpes distributions.

                   Per capita means “by the head,” and it divides the policy’s death benefit equally among the surviving
                   members of the class. Example; an insured has two adult children designated as primary beneficiaries:

                           ■ Both are living when the insured dies, each receives 50% of the policy’s death benefit;
                           ■ One dies before the insured, the surviving child will receive the entire death benefit.
                   The per capita beneficiary designation does not transfer death proceeds below a generational level. If
                   the deceased child had children they would not receive proceeds upon the death of their grandparent.

                                Per stirpes means “by the branch,” and it signifies that the children of a deceased class beneficiary are
                                entitled to that beneficiary’s share of the proceeds. Using the same example as above:

                                       ■ Both children are living when the insured dies, each gets 50% of the policy’s death benefit;
                                       ■ One child dies before the insured, the surviving child gets 50% of the death benefit and the two
                                         children of the deceased child, the insured’s grandchildren, receive 25% each of the proceeds.

                                7.5.3 Secondary/Contingent Beneficiaries
                                The primary beneficiary is the first in line to receive the policy’s death benefit.

                                The contingent beneficiary is the next in line to receive the policy’s death benefit if the primary
                                beneficiary dies before the insured. There can be more than one level of contingent beneficiary.

                                The secondary/contingent beneficiary is next in line if the primary beneficiary has died, and the tertiary
                                beneficiary is third in line if the secondary beneficiary has died.

                                A secondary/contingent beneficiary has no right to benefits if any primary beneficiary is still alive.
                                Contingent beneficiaries get proceeds only if all the beneficiaries on the level above them have died
                                before the insured.

                     7.5.4 Revocable Versus Irrevocable
                     The policyowner may submit to the insurer a written request to change or revoke beneficiary
                     designations without notice and without the beneficiaries’ knowledge or consent. Such designations are
                     called revocable beneficiaries.

                     Policyowners can give up their right to change a beneficiary designation. Such designations are called
                     irrevocable beneficiaries.

                     An irrevocable beneficiary designation can only be changed with their written consent. If an irrevocable
                     beneficiary dies before the insured, the policyowner usually has the right to name a new beneficiary.

                                7.5.7 Uniform Simultaneous Death Act
                                Consider the problem that may arise if the insured and the primary beneficiary both die in the same
                                accident. Payment of the policy proceeds differs dramatically depending on who died first. Let’s go
                                through some scenarios and discuss how this act affects these situations.

                                       ■ If the insured dies first, the proceeds should be paid to the primary beneficiary. What happens if
                                         the primary beneficiary dies in a common accident along with the insured?
                                       ■ If the primary beneficiary dies first, the proceeds should be paid to the contingent beneficiary.
                                       ■ If there is no contingent beneficiary, the proceeds should be paid to the insured’s estate.
                                However, in such accidents, it is sometimes impossible to tell who died first. If so, who gets the
                                proceeds?

                                The Uniform Simultaneous Death Act solves this problem by directing that the primary beneficiary
                                is assumed to have died first. That is, if the insured and the primary beneficiary die as a result of the
                                same accident, the policy proceeds will not be paid to the primary beneficiary since this person just
                                died. Instead, proceeds are paid to the contingent beneficiary or to the insured’s estate if no contingent
                                beneficiary is listed.

                   7.5.8 Common Disaster Provision
                   This common disaster provision expands on the intent of the Uniform Simultaneous Death Act by
                   providing a more lenient timespan between the death of the insured and the primary beneficiary when
                   by a common accident. Many times, one person could live several hours or days beyond the accident
                   but ultimately die due to the accident. Insurance companies call this the Common Disaster Provision,
                   and this language will appear on the policy. This provision presumes that, for insurance purposes, the
                   primary beneficiary dies first (when death occurs within a few days of the insured after a common
                   accident). Most insurance policies define this timeframe as death within 30 to 90 days of the accident
                   (exact number will be specified in the policy). This prevents the life insurance proceeds to be paid to
                   the estate of the primary beneficiary.


                         EXAMPLE
                                                   John is married to Marcy. John has a $500,000 life insurance policy and
                                              has named the primary beneficiary as Marcy and the contingent beneficiary as
                                              their children. John and Marcy are in the car together and are in a very serious
                                              automobile accident. John dies on the scene, and Marcy is rushed to the hospital.
                                              Marcy lives for 10 days and then passes away. How are John’s life insurance pro-
                                              ceeds distributed? Since Marcy died within a few days of John after the accident,
                                              the Common Disaster Provision assumes that Marcy died first. Since the primary
                                              beneficiary was deceased when proceeds are to be paid, they are paid to the
                                              contingent beneficiary (their kids).

                   If the primary beneficiary lives beyond the period of time stated in the policy, the proceeds would be
                   paid to the primary beneficiary or the primary beneficiary’s estate, if deceased.

                                7.5.9 Spendthrift Provision
                                A spendthrift clause may be included in a life insurance policy requiring that the policy proceeds be
                                paid to the beneficiary in installments of a defined amount and at set intervals. The beneficiary has no
                                right to elect a different settlement. Furthermore, the beneficiary is not allowed to borrow from the
                                policy proceeds nor assign any of the proceeds. In this way, the insured is assured that the beneficiary
                                will not spend money foolishly as a “spendthrift” (hence the name) upon the insured’s death. This
                                clause acts to prevent creditors from attaching the policy proceeds upon the insured’s death.

                                                                                                     Spendthrift Provision

        7.6        EXCLUSIONS
                   Many life insurance policies contain exclusions, or exceptions that define when coverage does not
                   apply. A life insurer is not liable for a loss caused by the insured engaging in an illegal activity. In
                   addition to illegal activities, the most common exclusions are as follows.

                   7.6.1 Suicide
                   Under the suicide exclusion, death by suicide is not covered for a certain period of time after the policy
                   goes into effect. Depending on the policy, the period may be one or two years.

                   If the insured commits suicide during this initial period, the policy’s death benefit is not payable, but
                   all premiums paid for the policy are refunded. After the policy has been in force for the stated period,
                   suicide is covered and the full death benefit is payable.

                   7.6.2 Aviation
                   The aviation exclusion eliminates coverage only for certain types of aviation activities. It does not apply
                   to commercial flight. That is, coverage still exists for insureds who are fare-paying airline passengers or
                   commercial airline pilots or crew. The exclusion applies only to individuals such as private pilots, test
                   pilots, military pilots and crew.

                                7.6.3 War or Military Service
                                There are two versions of the war or military service exclusion.

                                Status-type—This version eliminates coverage for the entire period during which the insured is in the
                                military, regardless of how the insured dies. Under the status-type war or military service exclusion,
                                even if the insured were home on leave and died driving to the golf course, no death benefit would be
                                paid.

                                Results-type—Under this version, coverage is eliminated only if the cause of death was related to
                                military service.

                                7.6.4 Hazardous Occupation or Hobby
                                The hazardous occupation or hobby exclusion may be included if the insured engages in activities
                                such as mountain climbing, auto racing, sky diving, or scuba diving, either for pay or recreation. As an
                                alternative to excluding coverage entirely for death resulting from these activities, the insurer might
                                charge an additional premium or limit the amount of coverage it would issue.

                                                                                                       Life Policy Exclusions

                             8.1   INTRODUCTION
                                   In the middle ages, guilds were formed for the mutual aid, protection, and the furtherance of the
                                   professional interests of craftspeople. Most craftspeople were trained through this system and the
                                   wealthier guilds had large coffers that acted as a type of insurance fund.

                                   If a business burned down, the guild would rebuild it using money from its coffers. If a master were
                                   robbed, the guild would cover his obligations and if a master were disabled or killed, the guild would
                                   support him or his widow and family.

                                   This style of insurance is still around today in the form of group insurance. This unit introduces you
                                   to Group Life Insurance, a group coverage frequently offered by companies to their employees and by
                                   unions to their members.

                8.2             LEARNING OBJECTIVES

                      After successfully completing this unit, you should be able to:

                          ӽ identify the groups that are eligible for group insurance: employer group plans, multiple employer
                            trusts (METs), labor union, association group plans, and group credit life insurance;
                          ӽ explain master policy and certificates of insurance;
                          ӽ explain the difference between contributory and noncontributory polices and the group insurance
                            policies;
                          ӽ explain the underwriting process in group insurance including eligibility requirements,
                            probationary period, and enrollment period;
                          ӽ describe how the insurance coverage amount for the employee is decided in group insurance;
                          ӽ identify group insurance coverage for dependents of the employee;
                          ӽ explain the conversion privilege; and
                          ӽ compare and contrast the characteristics of individual and group credit insurance.


        8.3        GROUP LIFE INSURANCE
                   An individual life insurance policy provides coverage for one person; group life insurance however,
                   provides coverage for many lives using one contract. For this reason, group life insurance premiums are
                   less expensive than an individual policy.

                   The distinctive and unique characteristics of group life insurance and the regulatory and underwriting
                   requirements are the subject of this unit.


        8.4        TYPES OF ELIGIBLE GROUPS
                   The general rule for eligibility to sponsor a group insurance plan is the group must have been formed
                   for a purpose other than for obtaining group insurance for its members.

                   Group insurance eligibility is limited to the following types of groups.

                          ■ Employer Group Plans: A group insurance plan sponsored for employees is sometimes referred
                            to as employee group plans.
                          ■ Multiple Employer Trusts (METs): A trust made up of multiple small employers in the same or
                            similar industries that form to provide life insurance or other benefits for their employees while
                            gaining tax benefits.
                          ■ Labor Unions: Two or more labor unions may join together to provide group insurance for their
                            collective members. Labor union plans are sponsored under a Taft-Hartley Trust.
                          ■ Association Group Plans: A trade, professional, or other type of association may sponsor a
                            group plan for its members.

                                             ■ Group Credit Life Insurance: A lender, or creditor, may sponsor a group life insurance plan for

                                8.5   MASTER POLICY VS. CERTIFICATES OF INSURANCE
                                      One master policy is issued to the sponsoring group and the applicant is policyowner or policyholder.
                                      This could be an employer or the labor union.

                                      The individual employee or member is not a party to the group insurance contract. Instead of getting
                                      a copy of the master policy, they receive a certificate of insurance as evidence of their coverage under
                                      the master policy. The certificate contains a summary of the insured’s benefits under the plan, the
                                      individual’s certificate number, and their beneficiary’s name.

                                      The employee, a certificate holder, has the right to name their beneficiary.

                   the entire premium on behalf of the employees, the plan is noncontributory.

                             eligible employees under a group insurance plan, at least 150 must enroll and pay their part of the
                             premium for the employer to sponsor the plan.

                                8.7   GROUP UNDERWRITING
                                      The insurance underwriter focuses on the group as a whole, rather than its singular members. Each
                                      group participant is required to complete a short form that usually consists of the individual’s name,
                                      address, Social Security number, dependent information and beneficiary designation. There are
                                      typically no medical questions; thus, no actual medical underwriting takes place. It’s therefore possible
                                      for individuals with poor health to receive group insurance benefits.

                                      Once the group plan is in force, premiums are based on the experience of the group. Group life
                                      insurance usually renews annually, and premiums can fluctuate from year to year.

                                      Some underwriting considerations may include:

                                           ■ Stability of the group—group does not have excessive employee turnover;
                                           ■ Persistency of the group—groups that change insurers every year may not represent a good risk;
                                             and
                                           ■ Existence of the group—insurance purchase must be incidental to the group’s formation.

        8.8        ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS
                   Employers need not include every employee in the plan, but they cannot choose which individuals will
                   be covered and which will not. They are allowed to determine which classes of employees will be eligible
                   for the plan.

                   Employers may classify employees using almost any standard. The two most common are:

                           ■ full-time versus part-time, and
                           ■ years of service.
                   For example, an employer could decide to make the group life insurance plan available to employees
                   who have been working for the employer on a full-time basis for at least one year.

                   Another common requirement is that employees be on active status at the time they enroll in the
                   plan—that is, not on a disability leave of absence or other inactive status.

                   8.8.1 Probationary Period
                   A probationary period requires new employees to wait for a certain period of time before they can
                   enroll in the plan. During this period they are not covered by the group insurance plan. Probationary
                   periods typically range from one to twelve months. The time period is chosen by the employer and

                                8.8.2 Enrollment Period
                                Individuals (employees/union members/etc.) become covered by the plan automatically after fulfilling
                                the probationary period. In a contributory plan, employees decide whether they want to participate, in
                                a noncontributory plan, all eligible employees must be included.

                                To avoid adverse selection, eligible employees must sign up within 31 days after the probationary
                                period ends, called the enrollment period. The employee can enroll without providing evidence of
                                insurability; no medical questions or exams will be needed. If the employee declines coverage during
                                the enrollment period and then decides later to enroll, the insurer may ask medical questions and
                                require a medical exam. Many plans do not allow “late enrollees” to enroll until the annual open
                                enrollment period.

        8.9        COVERAGE AMOUNT
                   Employers and unions determine the amount of coverage their employees and members will receive
                   from the group life insurance plan. The actual amount of coverage does not have to be the same.
                   However, coverage must be based on a formula that applies uniformly to all plan participants. Some
                   common formulas are:

                           ■ a percentage or multiple of earnings. Example: participating employees receive coverage equal to
                             their earnings, or half of their earnings, or some other multiplier; an amount of coverage based
                             on years of service. Example: participants receive $5,000 of coverage for each year of employment,
                             i.e. a two-year employee receives $10,000, a 10-year employee would receive $50,000; and
                           ■ a coverage limit for different classes of employees. Example: employees receive $20,000,
                             supervisors $50,000, and corporate officers $100,000 of coverage.
                   Coverage for dependents is usually a lesser amount than the limits established for employees.

                                                                                          Group Eligibility

        8.10 COVERAGE FOR DEPENDENTS
                   In addition to eligible employees, their dependents may be provided with coverage under a group life
                   insurance plan. Eligible dependents typically includes:

                           ■ the insured’s spouse;
                           ■ the insured’s children;
                           ■ the insured’s dependent parents; or
                           ■ other individuals financial dependent on the insured.
                   Typically, dependent coverage is a smaller amount than the employee.

                                    A drawback of group life insurance is that certificate holders and dependents lose their coverage if:

                                          ■ the certificate holder leaves the employer;
                                          ■ the employer discontinues the plan; or
                                          ■ the insurer does not renew the policy.
                                    Dependents also lose their coverage if:

                                          ■ the certificate holder dies; or
                                          ■ they are legally divorced from the certificate holder.

                     As a remedy, certificate holders and dependents must have the right to convert their group coverage
                     to an individual policy if any of those events occur. While this varies from state to state, the following
                     rules apply:

                                ■ the conversion must be done within 31 days from the date coverage is lost;
                                ■ the converted policy must be permanent insurance, not term;
                                ■ the converted policy must provide the same coverage amount as the individual had under the
                                  group policy;
                                ■ the premium will be based on the insured’s attained age at the time of conversion; and
                                ■ no proof of insurability is required.
                     Group life coverage continues through the 31-day conversion period. If the insured dies during that
                     period, the group death benefit is paid as if the insured had decided to convert the group coverage to an
                     individual policy.

                                                                                             Conversion

                     Creditors sponsor group credit life insurance plans for their borrowers as part of the loan transaction.
                     The amount of insurance is equal to the debt owed. Example: an individual, during the financing
                     process, may be offered credit life insurance in the amount of a car loan and the cost will be included
                     in the monthly car note. If the borrower dies, the lender, the beneficiary, will receive the amount of life
                     insurance to pay off the outstanding debt.

                     The same borrower could choose to purchase an individual policy and assign the death benefit to the
                     lender.

                     Advantages for an individual policy:

                                ■ the policyowner controls the individual policy, the lender controls/owns the group policy, and
                                ■ the policy can continue even after the debt/loan has been paid off.

                                Disadvantages for an individual policy:

                                      ■ individual policy premiums can be higher than group coverage, and
                                      ■ evidence of insurability is required for individual coverage, not usually for group coverage.

                                9.1   INTRODUCTION
                                      Medical science is keeping people alive longer and that’s a good thing. On the other hand, people are
                                      living beyond their life expectancy and outliving their money.

                                      Annuities were designed to provide a steady cash flow for an individual during their retirement years
                                      and to alleviate fears of outliving one’s assets; referred to as longevity risk.

                                      An annuity is a financial product sold by financial institutions like insurance companies. This unit
                                      discusses the different types of annuity contracts, the unique provisions, and the tax implications of the
                                      distributions made to annuitants.

        9.3        BASIC ANNUITY CONCEPTS
                   When an individual purchases life insurance, the insurance company that issued the policy promises to
                   pay the death benefit to the named beneficiary when the named insured dies, regardless of when that
                   occurs. The insurance company that issues an annuity also makes a promise but, in this case, it is to an
                   annuity contract owner. The promise is that if the contract is annuitized, it will pay an income to the
                   annuitant, regardless of how long they live. Life insurance protects people from dying too soon, while
                   annuities protect people from living too long.

                   As a financial product, annuities can be used to:

                          ■ accumulate funds over a period of time;
                          ■ evenly distribute a fund over a period of time; or
                          ■ both accumulate a fund and then evenly distribute it over a period of time.
                   An annuity contract has two phases; “Pay-In” and “Pay-Out.”

                   9.3.1 Annuity Phases
                   An annuity can have two phases or periods. The “Pay-In” phase called the accumulation period when
                   principal and periodic deposits grow with credited interest. The “Pay-Out” or distribution phase is
                   called the annuitization period. Now the contract generates an income stream from its accumulated
                   value.

                                An annuity cannot be used for both phases at the same time and once the contract is annuitized, no
                                more contributions can be made.

                                9.3.1.1 Accumulation Period
                                The Accumulation Period is when an annuity is being funded, before a payout begins. Life insurance
                                companies issue these contracts and the money paid into the annuity is called a premium.

                                Interest is credited on the accumulated value in the contract and the accumulated contract value grows
                                beyond the contract owner’s deposits.

                                During the accumulation period, the owner can generally:

                                      ■ make additional premium payments or deposits;
                                      ■ take withdrawals from the accumulated value;
                                      ■ surrender the annuity for its cash value; and
                                      ■ make other changes to the contract.

                                9.3.1.2 Annuitization Period
                                The Annuitization Period is the “Pay-Out” phase of the contract. Money in the contract is converted
                                into a series of regular income payments that can continue for life or for a stated period of time.

                                When the annuitization period starts, the accumulated value no longer belongs to the annuity owner:

                                      ■ no additional premium payments can be made;
                                      ■ no withdrawals can be taken;
                                      ■ the annuity cannot be surrendered; and
                                      ■ the owner can’t change the contract.

                   9.3.2 Parties Involved in the Annuity Contract
                   There are four parties involved in an annuity contract:

                           ■ contract owner,
                           ■ annuitant,
                           ■ beneficiary, and
                           ■ insurer.

                   9.3.2.1 Contract Owner
                   The contract owner is the person or the couple who buy the annuity and has certain rights. The contract
                   owner has the right to:

                           ■ name or change the annuitant;
                           ■ name or change the beneficiary;
                           ■ choose the payout option;
                           ■ add more money or take withdrawals; and
                           ■ surrender or terminate the agreement.

                   9.3.2.2 Annuitant
                   The annuitant (insured) is similar to the insured in a life insurance policy. They are chosen by the
                   owner to receive the income payments during the annuitization period. The annuitant’s life expectancy
                   is used to determine the amount of the guaranteed payments. The annuitant must be an individual—a
                   natural person—and cannot be a corporation or a trust.

                   The annuitant does not have the power to make withdrawals, deposits, change the names of the parties
                   to the agreement, or terminate the contract. They must also sign the annuity contract.

                   The contract owner and the annuitant are frequently the same person.

                                9.3.2.3 Beneficiary
                                The beneficiary has no voice in the control or management of the annuity and only benefits upon
                                the death of the contract owner. The beneficiary can be a natural person or an entity like a trust or
                                corporation.

                                9.3.2.4 Insurer
                                The insurer is the party who issues the annuity contract. Representing the insurer may be a local bank,
                                a financial planner, a brokerage firm, or an agent/producer.

                                                                                                      Parties to an Annuity

                                9.3.3 Annuities vs. Life Insurance
                                Insurance companies create both annuities and life insurance. While both have features that resemble each
                                other, their purpose is very different. Life insurance provides money when you die to pay for any remaining
                                bills, cover the cost of the funeral, give money to loved ones or for any other financial obligation or desire
                                you wish to fulfill even in death. Annuities provide tax-deferred savings for retirement.

                                Annuities are often called upside down life insurance; both offer a death benefit to a named beneficiary.
                                However, that’s where the comparison stops.

                                 Life Insurance                               vs.   Annuities

                                 Uses a series of payments to guarantee             Uses a lump sum of accumulated money to
                                 a lump sum of money upon death                     guarantee a series of income payments while living

                   Both life insurance and annuities have tax benefits. No matter what kind of life insurance you select,
                   the beneficiary receives the funds tax-free when the insured dies. However, if you leave money in an
                   annuity to a beneficiary, they will have to pay taxes on any growth (interest) on the money that was put
                   into the contract.

        9.4        IMMEDIATE AND DEFERRED ANNUITIES
                   An immediate annuity is structured to provide current income and a deferred contract’s payout is a
                   specific date in the future.

                   9.4.1 Immediate Annuities
                   After paying a lump-sum premium, an immediate annuity or single premium immediate annuity
                   (SPIA) provides an individual with an income that may begin as soon as a month after purchase or
                   may be delayed for up to one year. The funds in the contract accumulate on a tax-deferred basis. When
                   payments begin, the portion of each payment that is attributed to interest is subject to taxes; the rest is
                   treated as a return of principal and, therefore, is tax free.

                   A single premium immediate annuity (SPIA) pays a monthly income immediately. The first payment
                   would be made after a delay of one payment interval or period. The earliest an income payment could
                   be paid is one month. The latest payments can start in one year.

                                9.4.2 Deferred Annuities
                                Unlike immediate annuities, deferred annuities do not start an income stream immediately. With
                                deferred annuities, the annuity owner chooses the premium amount and the frequency of premium
                                payments. Accumulated funds may be withdrawn at any time, subject to a possible surrender charge.
                                Lastly, the deferred annuity owner is not required to annuitize the contract.

                                9.4.2.1 Premium Payment Options
                                Deferred annuities can be purchased with a single premium [single premium deferred annuity
                                (SPDA)], or ongoing premium payments [periodic or flexible premium deferred annuities (PPDA or
                                FPDA)]. The premium payment options are similar to life insurance: monthly, quarterly, and so forth.
                                With all deferred annuities, the emphasis is on the accumulation of money for future use.

                   9.4.2.2 Withdrawal Penalties and Surrender Charges
                   A withdrawal from an annuity is taxed different than annuitized payments. When a withdrawal is taken
                   from an annuity, the earnings, or the growth portion, is taxed as ordinary income. Funds continue
                   to be taxed at ordinary income tax rates until the account value is reduced to the original investment
                   amount. For example, if you purchased a $20,000 annuity and it has grown to $45,000, the first $25,000
                   withdrawn will be fully taxable. Additionally, if a withdrawal is made prior to age 59½, there is an
                   additional 10% penalty on taxable earnings.
                   In order for the annuitant to avoid additional fees from the insurance company for early withdrawal,
                   there is a waiting period called the surrender period. Surrender periods may be as short as two years up
                   to 12 or more years. If funds are withdrawn during that time, a surrender charge may apply. Surrender
                   charges are stated in the contract and commonly start at 10%, declining each year. For example, if the
                   surrender period is 10 years, then funds withdrawn in Year 1 will be charged a 10% fee, in Year 2 a 9%
                   fee, in Year 3 an 8% fee, and so on.
                   For example, a $10,000 annuity contract has a schedule of surrender charges beginning with 7% in the
                   first year and declining by 1% each year thereafter. 10% of the contract value can be withdrawn each
                   year free of surrender charges. If the contract owner decides to withdraw $5,000, 10% of the $10,000
                   contract value, $1,000 is free of surrender charges. A 7% surrender charge, or $280, would apply on the
                   other $4,000 withdrawn.

                   9.4.2.3 Death Benefit
                   The deferred annuity death benefit does not provide a surviving family a life insurance policy. Rather,
                   the accumulated contract value is paid to a selected beneficiary if the annuity owner dies during the
                   accumulation period. The amount paid as a death benefit is the greater of:
                           ■ the accumulated value of the annuity; or
                           ■ the total premiums paid to that point, minus any withdrawals.
                   If the owner has not named a beneficiary for the death benefit, it will be paid to the owner’s estate.

        9.5        ANNUITIZATION PAYOUT OPTIONS
                   Annuity payout options are similar to life insurance settlement options. They fall into two categories:

                           ■ life annuities, which have a payment that is guaranteed to last for at least as long as the annuitant
                             lives; and
                           ■ temporary annuities, which do not.

                   9.5.1 Life Annuities
                   9.5.1.1 Life Only
                   Under the life only option, sometimes called a pure life income, payments stop when the annuitant
                   dies, regardless of when that occurs; one month or 20 years.

                   The advantage of the life only option is that it pays the highest monthly income amount because there are
                   no other contingencies and only the annuitant’s life expectancy was considered to determine the amount
                   of the monthly pay out.

                   The disadvantage of this selection is that the annuitant may die before their life expectancy and the total
                   payout they received was much less than the total amount paid into the contract.

                   The life only annuity payout option is also referred to as:

                           ■ straight life,
                           ■ pure life, or
                           ■ life—no refund.

                   9.5.1.2 Life with Refund
                   Under the Life with Refund option, if the annuitant dies and the total payments received are less than the
                   amount paid for the annuity, the difference is paid to the beneficiary. The money may be paid either as a:

                           ■ lump sum, called a cash refund; or
                           ■ continuation of payments in the same amount as was being paid to the annuitant, called an
                             installment refund.

                                The life with period certain option also pays an income for as long as the annuitant is alive. In
                                addition, the annuitant selects a payment period, typically 5, 10, or 20 years, and payments are
                                guaranteed to be made for at least that number of years. If the annuitant dies before the end of the
                                selected period, payments continue to the beneficiary for the rest of the period certain. No payments

                                9.5.1.4 Joint-Life-and-Survivor
                                With the joint-life-and-survivor option, the insurer promises to make payments until the last survivor
                                of two annuitants dies. For example, if the two annuitants were a married couple and the husband died
                                first, payments would continue to the spouse for the rest of her life.

                                The owner can choose for continued payments in the same amount for the survivor, or in a lesser
                                amount such as two-thirds or one-half of their monthly pay out.

                   9.5.1.5 Joint Life
                   The joint life annuity option pays income until the death of the first of two or more annuitants. While
                   the monthly payment is greater than other joint annuities, it is not considered suitable as a joint annuity
                   because the survivor is left without an income.

                   9.5.1.6 Factors in Determining a Life Annuity Payment Amount
                   Several factors are used to determine the payout of an annuity.

                           ■ Annuitant’s age Age is used to determine life expectancy, which indicates how long payments
                             will have to be made. The younger the annuitant, the lower the payment amount.
                           ■ Annuitant’s gender Life expectancy statistics show that as a group, women live longer than
                             men. Women generally receive lower payments than men of the same age.
                           ■ Payment guarantee A refund option will lower the payment. With a period certain option, the
                             longer the period, the lower the payment.
                           ■ Assumed interest rate The insurer assumes that it will earn some rate of interest on the funds
                             used to buy the annuity. The lower the assumed interest rate, the lower the payment.

                                      There are literally hundreds of different annuity types—enough to boggle the mind of anyone at first
                                      glance. Furthermore, the companies that issue annuities are busy creating new types of annuities every
                                      day to meet the changing needs of consumers. However, when all the different types of annuities are
                                      clustered together, it is easy to see that most differ on just a few important variables.

        202        Life and Health License Exam Manual, 1st Edition



                   There are four basic types of annuities:

                           ■ fixed,
                           ■ variable,
                           ■ equity-indexed, and
                           ■ market value adjusted.

                   9.6.1 Fixed Annuities
                   Fixed annuity values are guaranteed against loss. Aside from surrender charges that may apply, the
                   value of a fixed annuity will never be less than the amount paid into the contract.

                   9.6.1.1 General Account Assets
                   Fixed annuities are supported by the insurer’s general account; the investment risk is borne by the
                   insurer. The assets in the general account are conservatively invested typically in debt securities and
                   other fixed-rate investments that provide a steady return for many years.

                   9.6.1.2 Interest Rate Guarantees
                   During a fixed annuity’s accumulation period, accumulated values earn a current rate of interest that
                   is competitive with prevailing rates on other interest-bearing investments. The current rate is generally
                   declared at the beginning of the year and guaranteed for the year. The current rate may rise or fall from
                   year to year, but it will never be less than a guaranteed minimum rate that is stated in the contract.

                   9.6.1.3 Level Benefit Payment Amount
                   During the annuity period, fixed annuities provide a level payment amount. Annuitants can count on
                   getting a specified dollar amount of income on a regular basis.

                   Fixed payment can lose purchasing power during periods of inflation and over a number of years, the
                   fixed benefit may become inadequate to live on even though the dollar amount is the same.

                                9.6.2 Variable Annuities
                                Variable annuities have the potential to keep pace with inflation because they are supported by
                                investments (stocks and bonds). Historically stocks have tended to rise faster than the cost of living;
                                however, there is no guarantee that they will always do so. Variable annuities have investment risk
                                because values are not guaranteed against loss.

                                9.6.2.1 Separate Account Assets
                                Insurers are not allowed to bear the risk of variable annuities. Investment losses could impair the
                                insurer’s ability to maintain the value of their fixed annuities and other guaranteed products.

                                The assets that support variable annuities are kept in a separate account where the investment risk
                                is borne by the annuity owner. The owner makes the various investment choices called sub-accounts,
                                which resemble mutual funds.

                                9.6.2.2 Accumulation Units
                                The accumulated values of variable annuities are expressed as accumulation units, similar to shares
                                purchased in a mutual fund. The value of an accumulation unit is found by dividing the total value of
                                the separate account by the number of existing accumulation units.

                                9.6.2.3 Annuity Units
                                When the annuity period begins, the accumulation units are converted to annuity units. From that
                                point on, the number of annuity units stays the same throughout the annuity period; however, the value
                                of an annuity unit varies with the value of the investments in the separate account. If the value of the
                                separate account goes up, the amount of the annuity payment increases. If the value of the separate
                                account goes down, the annuity payment decreases.

                                9.6.2.4 Regulation as Securities
                                Variable annuities are regulated as insurance products and are also regulated as securities. This is called
                                dual regulation.

                                To sell variable annuities, a producer must have a life insurance license, a special variable annuities
                                certification (in certain states), and both a federal and state securities registration.

                                Under federal securities law, insurers must register their separate accounts with the Securities and
                                Exchange Commission and comply with certain requirements for selling securities. One important
                                provision of those laws requires producers to provide customers with a prospectus – a document
                                containing a detailed description of the product being offered – before beginning a sales presentation.

                   9.6.3 Equity-Indexed Annuities
                   Equity-indexed annuity (EIAs) is a type of tax-deferred annuity whose credited interest is linked to an
                   equity index—typically the S&P 500. It guarantees a minimum interest rate, typically between 1% and
                   3%, if held to the end of the surrender term and protects against a loss of principal.

                   EIA returns may be higher than fixed annuities. However, because of the costs of providing the
                   minimum guarantees, the returns will not be as high as a variable annuity. EIAs are a form of fixed
                   annuities and, therefore, the guarantees in the contract are backed by the insurer’s general account (not
                   a separate account).

                   9.6.4 Market Value Adjusted Annuities
                   A fixed annuity with a market value adjustment feature, also referred to as a modified guaranteed
                   annuity, offers the flexibility of various guarantee terms combined with the potential for higher interest
                   rates than traditional fixed investments. The guarantee terms range from shorter term to longer term
                   and typically credit higher interest rates for longer-term commitments. A guaranteed fixed rate is
                   declared for the length of each guarantee term.

                             The guaranteed rate is valid only if the investment is held until maturity. Investments may be split
                             amongst several guarantee terms to match various time horizons when funds may need to be accessed.
                             Withdrawals made before maturity of the guarantee term may be subject to a contingent deferred sales
                             charge (CDSC) and/or a market value adjustment (MVA). Typically, the length of the CDSC schedule
                             matches the duration of the guarantee term.

        9.7          USES OF ANNUITIES
                     The common uses for annuities are as follows.

                     9.7.1 Personal Uses
                     9.7.1.1 Lifetime Income at Retirement
                     The most common annuity contract is one that has tax deferred investment gains with the promise that
                     the investment savings and gains will provide income in the future in the form of regular distributions.
                     These days, human life expectancy can go well beyond the minimum retirement age, so retirees are
                     looking for guaranteed lifetime income that is consistent, safe and secure.

                     9.7.1.2 Accumulating Funds Prior to Retirement
                     Earnings on accumulated values are tax deferred until distributions begin. The recipient must pay the
                     ordinary income rate on any interest or investment earnings.

                     9.7.1.3 Funding Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs)
                     Flexible premium annuities are designed to be used for funding Individual Retirement Accounts; a
                     tax-favored retirement savings plan set up through a bank, securities firm, or insurance company.

                     9.7.1.4 Accumulating Education Funds
                     Annuities can be used for a long-term funding need like the accumulation of money that will be needed
                     to pay for a college education.

                                9.7.2 Employer-Sponsored Retirement Plans
                                Annuities are designed to accept employer contributions made to the retirement plans set up for their
                                employees. The annuity’s payout options can provide a lifetime income for the employee and their
                                spouses.

                                9.7.2.1 Group vs. Individual Annuities
                                Annuities can be used for both individual and group applications. Employer-sponsored retirement
                                plans may be funded with group annuities. The retirement plan owns the group annuity, and the
                                retirement plan document describes the benefits to which employees are entitled.

                                10.1 INTRODUCTION
                                    The life insurance and annuity contracts are purchased for specific reasons and needs. Through the fact-
                                    finding process, agents/producers assist customers in determining the type of policies they should buy
                                    and the affordability of those products.

                                    During the financial planning process, financial advisors consult with consumers regarding the tax
                                    rules that apply to these products. They explain the exclusion of the life insurance death benefit
                                    from gross income, the taxation of annuity payments, and deductions related to the purchase of life
                                    insurance and annuity contracts.

                                    It is very important for agents/producers to understand how the tax rules apply to insurance company
                                    products.

        10.3 INCOME TAX TREATMENT
                   Income tax treatment of life insurance and annuities comes down to two questions.

                         1. Is the premium tax-deductible or not?
                         2. Are distributions from insurance products taxable or not?

                                When a life insurance policy is surrendered, any gain in the cash value is taxable. The gain is the cash
                                value minus the policy’s cost basis; the sum of all premiums paid. So cash value accumulations are tax-
                                deferred, but not necessarily tax-free.

                                10.3.1.4 Withdrawals or Partial Surrenders
                                Withdrawals (partial surrenders) are taxable to the extent of any gain. Withdrawals are taxed on a
                                first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis; money withdrawn is considered to come from the premiums paid (cost
                                basis) FIRST and cost basis withdrawals are not taxable. The death benefit is reduced by a withdrawal of
                                cash value.

                                When a withdrawal exceeds the cost basis, the excess is taxable. If the cost basis is $10,000 and a
                                withdrawal is $12,000, $2,000 is considered excess and taxable.

                                Any money received from a policy, other than as a death benefit, reduces the policy’s cost basis.

                     10.3.1.5 Policy Loans
                     Cash value of a life insurance policy is used as collateral for a policy loan. Policy loans reduce the cash
                     value and policy death benefit; however, loans can be repaid at any time, which restores the cash value
                     and death benefit. Generally, loans are not taxable to the policyowner, even if the amount of the loan
                     exceeds the policy’s cost basis. The amount of any outstanding policy loan is not taxable when the
                     insured dies.

                     If a policy is surrendered or it lapses, under the tax rules for full surrenders, any portion of the loan
                     amount that exceeds the policy’s cost basis is a taxable gain.

                     The interest paid on policy loans is not tax-deductible.

                     10.3.1.6 Dividends
                     Dividends are not taxable. For tax purposes, dividends are considered to be a return of a portion of the
                     premium paid for the policy. Since premiums are paid with after-tax dollars, they are not taxed again
                     when they are returned in the form of dividends. However, as a return of premium, dividends also
                     reduce the policy’s cost basis.

                     While dividends are not taxable, if they are left to accumulate at interest, the interest is taxable.

                                10.3.1.7 Death Benefits
                                When the entire death benefit amount—“lump sum”—is paid to a named beneficiary it is not taxable as
                                income whether the policy is owned by an individual or a business.

                                If the death benefit payment is made under other settlement options—not a “lump sum”—the original
                                death benefit is not taxable, any interest earned on the proceeds are taxable as ordinary income when
                                paid to the beneficiary.

                                Accelerated death benefits are an advance of death benefits. Written certification from a physician is
                                required, diagnosing a qualifying event that will substantially decrease the insured’s life span. Qualified
                                events include terminal illnesses expecting to end in death within 24 months, acute illness, emergency
                                organ transplants, permanent confinement to nursing homes, and long-term care (if activities of daily
                                living can no longer be performed). Part or all of the death benefit may be used; the amount reduces the
                                benefit the beneficiaries will receive. Accelerated death benefits are tax exempt.

                             compensation arrangements
                   These are not considered to be approved business expenses because the business receives financial
                   benefits from owning these policies.

                                10.3.3 Group Life Insurance
                                Group life insurance premiums paid by the employer are tax-deductible as a business expense provided
                                under an employer group benefit plan. The premium for the first $50,000 of coverage is not taxable
                                to the employee. The premium for any additional coverage above $50,000 is taxable as income to the
                                employee.

                                With contributory plans, the employee portion of the group life insurance premium is not tax-
                                deductible.

                   10.3.4 Modified Endowment Contracts (MECs)
                   A Modified Endowment Contract, or a MEC, is a special type of life insurance under federal income
                   tax law. Specifically, the law prescribes a test that is intended to differentiate between policies that are
                   purchased primarily for certain tax advantages, versus policies that are purchased primarily for death
                   protection.

                   MECs are still life insurance and offer tax-free death benefits and tax-deferred cash value accumulation.
                   If a policy becomes a MEC and no distributions are taken from that policy during the insured’s lifetime,
                   they will not experience any adverse tax implications due to the contract’s MEC status.

                   To determine if a contract is a MEC, a premium limit is set and is referred to as a seven-pay limit or
                   MEC limit. It is based on the annual premium that would pay up the policy after the payment of seven
                   level annual premiums. This limit is based upon rules established by the Internal Revenue Code, and
                   sets the maximum amount of premium that can be paid into the contract during the first seven years
                   from the date of issue to avoid MEC status.

                   Under what is known as the seven-pay test or MEC test, the cumulative amount paid at any time in the
                   first seven years cannot exceed the cumulative MEC limit applicable in that policy year.

                   Example: a $50,000 flexible premium policy and the MEC limit is $1,000 each year for the first seven
                   years of the contract. $1,000 premium each year can be paid without triggering MEC status. If in the
                   fourth policy year a $2,000 payment is made, the total cumulative premium payments ($5,000) would
                   exceed the cumulative MECpremium limit of $4,000, and the policy would be classified as a MEC. The
                   insurer may refund excess premiums within 60 days to avoid having a policy become a MEC.

                                                                                         Modified Endowment Contract

                                       ■ If the contract owner is under age 59½, a 10% penalty tax must be paid in addition to the regular
                                         tax due on any taxable amount received. The penalty does not apply if the owner is disabled.

                     10.3.5.4 Annuity Payments
                     There are two phases to an annuity: accumulation “Pay-In” and annuitization “Pay-Out.” If the owner
                     withdraws money from an annuity in a lump sum, they face severe tax penalties on their savings. The
                     most likely method is to receive periodic or monthly payments.

                     The exclusion ratio is used to determine the nontaxable portion of each monthly payment. The formula
                     is applied to each annuity payment to find the portion that is excludable from gross income. The
                     remainder is taxable at ordinary income rates.


                              EXAMPLE
                                                     The annuity owner paid $12,000 into the contract and the expected pay-
                                                ments over the annuitant’s life expectancy is $19,200. The exclusion ratio is
                                                $12,000/$19,200, or 62.5%. If the monthly payment received is $100, the por-
                                                tion that can be excluded from gross income is $62.50 or 62.5% of $100. The
                                                $37.50 balance of each $100 monthly payment is ordinary income.

                     The exclusion ratio applies until the entire investment portion in the contract has been paid out. The
                     balance is taxable.

                                10.3.5.5 Distributions at Death
                                At death of the annuity owner, the beneficiary has a number of options for receiving the annuity’s value.

                                      ■ Lump sum The beneficiary can take the proceeds all at once. The gain (total value minus cost
                                        basis) is taxable.
                                      ■ Five-year withdrawal period The beneficiary must withdraw all proceeds within five years.
                                        These withdrawals are taxed the same as withdrawals during the owner’s life. That is, the gain is
                                        taxable and all the gain must be taken out before any non-taxable cost basis is withdrawn.
                                      ■ Annuity payout The beneficiary may take the proceeds under an annuity payout option. This
                                        option must be selected within one year from the date of the owner’s death. The payments are
                                        taxed as annuity payments – part taxable gain and part non-taxable cost-basis, with the non-
                                        taxable amount determined using the exclusion ratio.
                                      ■ Spousal option If the beneficiary is the owner’s spouse, ownership may be transferred to the
                                        spouse without any tax consequences.
                                If death occurs during the annuity period, tax treatment of any continuing payments depends on
                                whether those payments are being made to a:

                                      ■ survivor annuitant, or
                                      ■ beneficiary.
                                If payments are made to a survivor annuitant under a joint-and survivor annuity, they continue to be
                                taxed as they were when made to both annuitants. If the entire cost basis has not yet been paid out,
                                the same exclusion ratio percentage is used to determine the amount excludable from taxable income
                                even if the payment to the survivor annuitant is reduced, such as under a joint-and-two-thirds-survivor
                                annuity. Payments become fully taxable when the entire cost basis has been paid out.

                                If payments are made to a beneficiary under an annuity payout option that guarantees a certain payout,
                                the entire payment becomes non-taxable until the entire cost basis has been paid out (including the
                                portion of cost basis that was paid to the annuitant). At that point, any remaining guaranteed payments
                                are fully taxable. If the entire cost basis was paid out to the annuitant, any guaranteed payments made
                                to the beneficiary are fully taxable from the start.

                   10.3.6 Section 1035 Exchanges
                   Gain in an annuity or life insurance contract is taxable when the policy is surrendered. Under this
                   general rule, individuals would always have to pay income tax on their gains when they surrender a life
                   insurance policy or annuity.

                   Section 1035 of the tax code allows individuals to move cash values from one contract to another
                   without having any gain taxed at that time. To qualify, the old and the new life insurance policies must
                   have the same policyowner and the same insured. In the case of an annuity, the old and new annuity
                   contracts must have the same contract owner and same annuitant.

                   Section 1035 exchange applies to:

                         1. life insurance, and
                         2. annuities.
                   The following movement of cash values qualifies under section 1035 with no taxable consequence:

                           ■ life insurance policy to another life insurance policy;
                           ■ annuity contract to another annuity contract; and
                           ■ life insurance policy to annuity contract.
                   The surrender of an annuity to move the cash values to a life insurance policy does not qualify as a 1035
                   exchange. The gain in the contract becomes taxable upon the surrender of the annuity.

                                    Estate taxes are owed if an estate’s value exceeds a certain value at the time of the individual’s death. The
                                    taxes are a percentage of the estate’s value.

                                    Life insurance death benefits are counted as a value in a deceased insured’s estate if:

                                           ■ they are payable to the estate;
                                           ■ the deceased possessed any incidents of ownership in the policy at the time of death—the right to
                                             name or change the beneficiary, the right to access cash values, the right to assign ownership of
                                             the policy to another party, etc.; or

                   10.4.2 Annuities
                   The estate tax treatment of annuities depends on whether death occurs during the accumulation period
                   or during the annuity period.

                           ■ If death occurs during the accumulation period, the entire value of the annuity—not just the
                             gain, but also the cost basis—is included in the estate.
                           ■ If death occurs during the annuity period, the present value of any payments that will continue to
                             a beneficiary or survivor annuitant is included in the estate.

                                11.1 INTRODUCTION
                                    According to a leading expert on the economic impact of retirement, over half of U.S. workers will not
                                    be able to maintain their standard of living when they retire. In fact, a large percentage will be either at
                                    or near the Federal Poverty Level. Accountability may be equally shared between employers who offer
                                    fewer sponsored plans for workers and workers who are not saving for retirement.

                                    It’s been said that people don’t plan to fail, but they fail to plan; this is case with many Americans.
                                    While many savings vehicles exist, people are either unfamiliar with or unaware of their existence.

                                    Insurance agents/producers who are familiar with the details and options available in retirement
                                    planning assist people of all ages to plan for the future. This unit provides foundational knowledge of
                                    several employer-sponsored and individual retirement plans.

                              Individuals may deduct IRA contributions from taxable income if:

                                     ■ the individual or spouse is not covered by an employer-sponsored retirement plan; or
                                     ■ the adjusted gross income (AGI) is under a certain limit.
                              IRA contributions can be deducted (partially or full) on a federal income tax return and the income
                              limit ranges are adjusted annually.

                              The entire contribution is deductible for incomes below the range.

                              A portion of the contribution is deductible for incomes between the ranges.

                              No portion of a contribution is deductible for incomes above the range.

                              A full annual limit contribution is allowed whether it will or will not be deducted from federal income
                              taxes.

                              Earnings on IRA contributions are tax-deferred—income tax is not due until the earnings are
                              withdrawn. A premature withdrawal—withdrawal taken before age 59½—may incur a 10% penalty tax
                              in addition to income tax due on the amount withdrawn. The 10% penalty is waived for the following
                              reasons.

                                     ■ Death or total and permanent disability of the IRA owner
                                     ■ Periodic payments made over the owner’s life expectancy
                                     ■ Certain medical expenses
                                     ■ Payment of health insurance premiums while unemployed
                                     ■ Certain higher education expenses

                              11.3.4 Rollovers and Transfers
                              There are two ways to move IRA accounts from one company to another or from an employer-
                              sponsored plan to an individual IRA:

                                     ■ rollovers: the money from the original IRA or qualified plan is distributed to the owner and they
                                       deposit it to the new IRA carrier; and
                                     ■ transfers: called direct transfers—the money from the original IRA or qualified plan is distributed
                                       directly to the new IRA carrier without coming into the owner’s possession.
                              Three rules for rollovers:

                                     ■ the money must be deposited within 60 days of its receipt by the owner, or it becomes taxable. And
                                       if the owner is under age 59½, it will also incur a 10% penalty tax unless an exception applies;
                                     ■ if the rollover is coming from an employer-sponsored plan it is subject to withholding tax rate of
                                       20%. For example, the owner will only receive $80,000 of a $100,000 employer-sponsored plan
                                       rollover. Twenty-thousand dollars (20%) will be sent to the IRS. The owner will get the $20,000

                                   withholding back at tax filing time if the owner deposits $100,000 with the new IRA custodian.
                                   If the owner only deposits $80,000, the $20,000 is taxable and subject to 10% tax penalty if under
                                   age 59½; and
                              ■ an IRA may be rolled over only once in any 12-month period.
                     These rules do not apply to transfers from one plan to another.

                     11.3.5 SECURE Act 2.0
                     Retirees must start receiving a required minimum distribution from qualified retirement plans by
                     April 1 of the year following the year they reach the applicable age. In the case of an individual who
                     attains age 72 after December 31, 2022, and age 73 before January 1, 2033, the applicable age is 73. If a
                     person fails to take the required minimum distribution, they may be subject to a 25% excise tax penalty.
                     The person is allowed a correction window in which if the person receives the required distribution
                     and submits a tax return reflecting the distribution, then the excise tax penalty is reduced to 10%.
                     Generally, the correction window is two years after the end of the taxable year in which the tax is
                     imposed.

                                      ■ Spouses may choose to treat the IRA as their own or they may choose a lump-sum distribution.
                                      ■ Non-spouse beneficiaries may take a lump-sum distribution or distributions over the 10 years
                                        following the owner’s death.
                                The entire value of the IRA is includable in the deceased owner’s estate.

                   11.3.8 Roth IRAs
                   Roth IRAs were introduced in 1997. They follow rules similar to traditional IRAs except:

                           ■ contributions are never deductible; and
                           ■ qualified distributions are tax-free if they meet these two requirements
                                 1. the Roth IRA has been set up at for least five years, and
                                 2. distribution is after age 59½, or due to death, disability, or being a first-time homebuyer; first-
                                    time homebuyer is subject to a $10,000 limit.
                   Roth IRAs have no minimum distribution requirements (RMDs) and individuals may contribute to a
                   Roth IRA regardless of their age.

                   Individuals may have both a Roth IRA and a traditional IRA, but the total annual contribution to both
                   may not exceed the maximum limit for one IRA. Contributions to Roth IRAs are phased out for higher-
                   income taxpayers.

                              11.4 EMPLOYER-SPONSORED QUALIFIED PLANS

                                  11.4.1 Tax Advantages
                                  All employer-sponsored qualified plans have the following tax advantages.

                                       ■ Employer contributions are tax-deductible to the business.
                                       ■ Employee contributions are tax-deductible to the employee.
                                       ■ Neither employer nor employee contributions are taxable as current income to employees.
                                       ■ All (except for the Roth 401(k) feature) earnings grow tax-deferred.

                                  11.4.2 Taxation of Distributions
                                  All (except for the Roth 401(k) feature) distributions from employer-sponsored qualified plans are
                                  taxable, because they come from deductible contributions and tax-deferred earnings.

                                  Tax rules for distributions from employer-sponsored qualified plans are similar to traditional IRAs.

                                       ■ Withdrawals taken before age 59½ are considered premature, unless there is an exception, a 10%
                                         penalty tax applies in addition to any ordinary income tax.
                                       ■ Required minimum distributions must begin the year the individual turns the applicable age for
                                         required minimum distributions, the first payment may be delayed until April 1 of the following
                                         year.

                                  11.4.3 General Requirements
                                  All employer-sponsored qualified plans must be approved by the IRS to qualify for favorable tax
                                  treatment. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) established the following
                                  requirements for retirement plans.

                                       ■ Participation—plans must benefit all regular employees, not just a few selected ones. Generally,
                                         participation must be open to any employee age 21 or over with one year of service.
                                       ■ Non-discrimination—plans may not provide benefits to executives and other highly paid
                                         individuals that are out of proportion to those provided to rank-and-file employees. Plans may
                                         not discriminate on the basis of sex.
                                       ■ Vesting—determines when employees own the money in their plan. Employees are always
                                         immediately 100% vested in their own contributions. As for employer contributions, employees
                                         generally must become 100% vested after six years.
                                       ■ Reporting and disclosure—each participant must receive in writing, when they enroll, a summary
                                         plan description, notification of any significant changes, and an annual report.
                                       ■ Fiduciary —anyone with control over the plan or its assets are fiduciaries. They must manage the
                                         plan solely in the best interest of its participants using the “prudent person rule.”

                                11.4.4.1 Pension Plans
                                Pension plans may be either defined benefit or defined contribution plans. Pension plans require
                                employers to make funding contributions to the plan every year.

                                Defined benefit pension plans are designed to provide a specific benefit to an employee upon
                                retirement. The employee payout at retirement typically depends on how long they worked and their
                                salary. The plan may allow a lump-sum payout or a monthly “annuity” payment.

                                Defined contribution pension plans do not specify what an employee will receive at retirement; it only
                                specifies how much money the employee and employer can contribute.

                                11.4.4.2 Profit-Sharing Plans
                                A profit-sharing plan is a defined contribution plan that does not require an employer to make a
                                funding contribution every year. Rather, the amount and timing of contributions is at the employer’s
                                discretion. Contributions are dependent on the company making a profit.

                                The maximum amount that an employer may contribute to a profit-sharing plan as a whole is limited to
                                25% of the company’s payroll for all employees.

                   11.4.4.4 401(k) Plans
                   401(k) Plans allow taxpayers a break on taxes on their deferred income. Employees can save and
                   invest a piece of their paycheck before taxes are taken out. They won’t be taxed on that money until it’s
                   withdrawn.

                   Employers may make matching contributions up to a certain dollar amount or percentage of the
                   employee’s contributions. The plan has annual contribution limits that are considerably higher than the
                   limit on annual IRA contributions.

                                11.4.4.5 403(b) Plans
                                403(b) Plans (also known as tax-sheltered accounts) work much like 401(k) plans, but they are for
                                employees of non-profit organizations such as public school systems, churches, and hospitals. Employee
                                and employer contribution limits are generally the same as those for 401(k) plans.

                                11.4.4.6 Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) Plans
                                Simplified Employee Pension (SEP) plans have significantly less paperwork and easier administration
                                than qualified retirement plans. Essentially, each employee sets up an IRA and the employer makes
                                contributions to them on the employees’ behalf. Employer contribution limits for SEP-IRAs are much
                                higher than the usual IRA limits. Annual employer contributions may not exceed 25% of the employee’s
                                compensation up to a specified maximum contribution amount.

                                Employees must be immediately 100% vested in employer contributions made under a SEP plan.

                     11.4.4.7 Savings Incentive Match Plans for Employees (SIMPLEs)
                     Savings Incentive Match Plans for Employees (SIMPLEs) are a simplified retirement plan for small
                     employers with 100 or fewer employees and no other type of retirement plan. A SIMPLE may be
                     structured as an IRA or a 401(k) plan. SIMPLE plans allow employees to defer a portion of their
                     compensation into the plan and employers are required to match those contributions dollar-for-dollar
                     for at least 1% up to 3% of each employee’s compensation. The dollar limit for employee contributions is
                     somewhat less than the amount that applies to 401(k) and 403(b) plans. All employees earning at least
                     $5,000 annually must be allowed to participate in the plan.

                     Employees are 100% vested in employer contributions made under a SIMPLE plan. A 25% penalty
                     tax on premature distributions applies during the first two years and the standard 10% penalty applies
                     thereafter.

                                11.5 EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA)
                                    ERISA was enacted to protect the interests of participants in employee benefit plans as well as the
                                    interests of the participants’ beneficiaries. Much of the law deals with qualified pension plans, but some
                                    sections also apply to group insurance plans.

                                    11.5.1 Fiduciary Responsibility
                                    ERISA mandates very detailed standards for fiduciaries and other parties-in-interest of employee
                                    welfare benefit plans, including group insurance plans. This means that anyone with control over plan
                                    management or plan assets of any kind must discharge that fiduciary duty solely in the interests of the
                                    plan participants and their beneficiaries. Strict penalties are imposed on those who do not fulfill this
                                    responsibility.

                                    Reporting and Disclosure ERISA requires that certain information concerning any employee
                                    welfare benefit plan, including group insurance plans, be made available to plan participants, their
                                    beneficiaries, the Department of Labor, and the IRS. Examples of the types of information that must be
                                    distributed include:

                                          ■ a summary plan description to each plan participant and the Department of Labor;
                                          ■ a summary of material modifications that details changes in any plan description to each plan
                                            participant and the Department of Labor;
                                          ■ an annual return or report (Form 5500 or one of its variations) submitted to the IRS;
                                          ■ a summary annual report to each plan participant; and
                                          ■ any terminal report to the IRS.

                                11.6 NON-QUALIFIED PLANS
                                    Employers who want to provide a benefit for select employees can use a non-qualified plan, a bonus
                                    plan, or a deferred compensation plan. These plans do not get the favorable tax treatment given to
                                    qualified plans. They do not need to meet the participation, non-discrimination, and other general
                                    requirements of qualified plans. Employers can design these plans in any way they wish.

                                12.1 INTRODUCTION
                                    How could our society function and prosper without access to quality medical care? Who would help
                                    doctors and hospitals finance viable practices that provide care and advance medical innovation?

                                    When health insurance became a reality a century ago it began to answer those questions. It’s a simple
                                    concept with enormous benefits and having health insurance is often the difference between living one’s
                                    life with a feeling of security versus tempting fate on a daily basis.

                                    Health insurance is a cornerstone of a family’s economic stability and this unit introduces the types of
                                    coverage available and the important terms, principles, and definitions.

                  12.2               LEARNING OBJECTIVES

                        After successfully completing this unit, you should be able to:

                              ӽ define the two perils that health insurance is designed to cover: accident and sickness;
                              ӽ identify health insurance covered benefits including hospital/medical expense coverage, disability
                                income insurance, dental expense insurance, and long-term care (LTC) insurance;
                              ӽ compare and contrast the different classes of health insurance policies: individual versus group,
                                private vs. government, and limited vs. comprehensive;
                              ӽ identify the limited benefit plans: limited perils, limited benefits, notice to proposed insured;
                              ӽ describe the eight types of limited policies: Accident-only, Specified (dread) disease/critical
                                illness, Hospital income (indemnity) insurance, credit disability insurance, blanket coverage,
                                prescription drug coverage, vision care, and hearing; and
                              ӽ list the common health insurance exclusions.


        12.3 DEFINITIONS OF PERILS
                     Health insurance is designed to cover two perils:

                              ■ accident: unintentional bodily injury caused by an unforeseen event; and
                              ■ sickness: a need for medical care due to a cause other than an accident.
                     A pre-existing condition is an illness or disease that existed before an individual’s health insurance went
                     in to effect. The federal Affordable Care Act (ACA) eliminated pre-existing condition exclusions for
                     medical expense policies affected by ACA. However, it is important to note that pre-existing condition
                     exclusions are still allowed for disability policies, long-term care insurance, Medicare supplements, and
                     limited benefit policies.

                                12.4 POLICY TYPES AND COVERAGE
                                    There are various health insurance policies that provide coverage for specific medical conditions and
                                    for this reason some individuals purchase multiple policies.

                                          ■ Hospital/medical expense coverage helps pay doctor and hospital bills. It includes coverage for
                                            diagnostic and treatment-related expenses such as lab tests, x-rays, and medical supplies. Many
                                            medical expense plans also cover the cost of prescription drugs.
                                          ■ Disability income insurance pays a stated amount of income to the insured when an accident or
                                            sickness leaves them unable to work for an extended period. While medical expense coverage
                                            pays doctor and hospital bills, disability income insurance provides money to pay other bills.
                                            Disability income insurance is frequently referred to as income replacement or loss-of-time
                                            coverage.
                                          ■ Dental expense insurance is similar to medical expense coverage in the respect that it helps to
                                            pay dental bills. Coverage is generally provided for routine dental care such as cleanings, fillings,
                                            crowns, root canals, and braces.
                                          ■ Long-term care (LTC) insurance provides coverage for medical and non-medical care for
                                            individuals with:
                                                        – chronic illnesses;
                                                        – cognitive impairment; or
                                                        – difficulty performing activities of daily living (ADLs) such as bathing, dressing, eating,
                                                          toileting, transferring, or continence.

                   12.5.2 Private vs. Government Insurers
                   Commercial insurers compete for business in the private sector. Government insurers provide benefits
                   to eligible individuals mandated by the law. Most government programs are partially or wholly paid for
                   by tax dollars.

                   These are the Federal health insurance programs:

                          ■ TRICARE—for active duty and retired military personnel
                          ■ Veterans Benefits—for discharged military service members
                          ■ Medicare—healthcare primarily for senior citizens & recipients of Social Security disability
                          ■ Medicaid—healthcare for individuals and families who are or become poor
                          ■ Social Security disability—for eligible individuals who become totally and permanently disabled
                   Certain state governments act as the insurer for workers’ compensation benefits and some states have
                   established programs for disability benefits.

                                  12.5.3 Limited vs. Comprehensive Coverage
                                  Comprehensive policies offer broad coverage for health care services. Limited policies provide benefits
                                  for only a particular type of loss and there are a number of special health insurance policies that
                                  provide limited coverage.


                              12.6 LIMITED PLANS
                                  Limited benefit plans are characterized by the following:

                                        ■ limited perils—while medical expense plans cover losses that arise from almost any cause with
                                          just a few exceptions, limited benefit plans cover losses that arise only from one peril or one type
                                          of peril, or which occur relative to a specific situation or location;
                                        ■ limited benefits—while medical expense plans have moved quickly toward providing very high
                                          or unlimited benefits, the amounts paid by limited benefit plans are typically much smaller and
                                          often restricted to stated amounts; and
                                        ■ notice to proposed insured—to assure that insureds understand the limited nature of the coverage
                                          they are buying, states require these policies to contain a prominent notice on their first page
                                          stating that the coverage provides only limited benefits.

        12.7 TYPES OF LIMITED POLICIES

                   12.7.1 Accident-Only
                   Accident-only policies only cover accidents as a peril, and exclude any type of sickness or disease.
                   Consequently, the premiums are smaller than policies that cover both illness and injury. Accident-only
                   policies may also pay a benefit if an accident results in dismemberment, disability, or death.

                   12.7.2 Specified (Dread) Disease/Critical Illness
                   Specified or dread disease policies were originally developed to cover one, or one type, of catastrophic
                   illness specified in the policy such as cancer or heart disease. Today these policies may cover a
                   number of life-threatening diseases or serious conditions including stroke, coma, liver failure, kidney




Life_Health_LEM_Book.indb 262                                                                                                         1/31/2022 9:43:43 PM
                                                                                               Unit 12   Introduction to Health Insurance        263



                                failure, and paralysis as well as the need for organ or bone marrow transplants. Some contain a health
                                screening benefit to help with early diagnosis of catastrophic illnesses. These wider-ranging policies are
                                sometimes called critical illness plans. But one thing they all have in common is that, whether they
                                cover one disease or many, benefits are strictly limited to those diseases specifically named in the policy.

                                These policies cover illnesses that are unlikely to affect everyone but are very expensive for
                                those diagnosed with the condition. These specified policies are fairly inexpensive compared to
                                comprehensive medical expense coverage.

                                Most policies may not pay the full cost of every treatment. There may be no coverage for transportation
                                or reimbursement for hospital room-and-board expenses may be limited to certain dollar amounts.
                                Some of these policies simply pay a lump sum benefit upon diagnosis of a specified disease.

                                12.7.3 Hospital Income (Indemnity) Insurance
                                A hospital income, or hospital indemnity, plan pays a flat dollar amount as a daily benefit for each day
                                that the insured is hospitalized as an inpatient. The payment is made directly to the insured, not to the
                                hospital. These plans are not designed to reimburse the insured for the expenses of hospitalization but
                                to provide income that the insured can use in any way he or she wants. Individuals may use this kind
                                of policy to meet the deductible and coinsurance payments on their medical expense policies or to pay
                                their other bills while they are in the hospital and unable to work.

                                12.7.4 Credit Disability Insurance
                                When retailers or lenders extend credit for a large purchase, they often require the consumer to have
                                credit disability insurance to secure the loan. If the consumer (debtor) becomes disabled, the policy’s
                                benefit is paid to the creditor (lender) to pay off the loan.

                                The credit disability policy is a group policy with the retailer as master policyowner and the debtors are
                                the group members. Retailers offer to include it as part of the credit/purchase transaction. Group credit
                                disability policies have the following features.

                                     ■ As group insurance, no individual underwriting is done, so no evidence of insurability is required.
                                     ■ The amount of coverage under the policy cannot be more than the amount of indebtedness
                                       remaining under the credit contract at any time, so the disability benefit may not exceed the
                                       monthly credit installment payment, or if the insurance coverage calls for a lump sum benefit,
                                       the amount of coverage will decrease over time as installment payments are made on the debt.
                                     ■ Consumers must be clearly notified that they are buying credit insurance coverage as part of
                                       the credit/purchase transaction; the coverage cannot be included in the transaction without the
                                       consumer’s knowledge and agreement.
                                While retailers or lenders can require a consumer to have insurance to secure credit, they cannot
                                require that the consumer obtain the coverage through them. Debtors may obtain their own individual
                                coverage or assign the benefit of an existing policy to secure the loan.

                                12.7.5 Blanket Coverage
                                Blanket coverage is a type of group insurance where the group members are identified as all the
                                persons engaged in a similar activity, such as employees at a company picnic, passengers on an airplane,
                                players or spectators at a sporting event, or students while they are on school grounds. Members are
                                automatically covered when they are part of the group, and coverage automatically ceases when the




Life_Health_LEM_Book.indb 263                                                                                                               1/31/2022 9:43:43 PM
        264        Life and Health License Exam Manual, 1st Edition



                   person is no longer part of the group. Because group membership can change so quickly with people
                   coming and going, the individual members are not named, and there is no application for insurance or
                   certificate of coverage.

                   12.7.6 Prescription Drugs
                   Prescription drug coverage can be included in a medical expense plan, added as a supplement to a
                   medical expense plan, or issued as stand-alone coverage. Usually, insureds must use a specific network
                   of pharmacies in order to receive benefits. Prescription drug plans generally work in one of two ways:

                          ■ Insureds are reimbursed for their prescription drug expenses using standard claim forms; or,
                          ■ Insureds are given a prescription drug card to present to a participating pharmacy, and they make
                            a relatively small co-payment to the pharmacy directly for each prescription refill. Co-payments
                            are generally $5 or $10 for generic drugs, and $15 or more for name brand drugs.
                   Prescription drug plans generally do not cover every drug. The list of drugs the plan covers is called its
                   formulary. A plan’s formulary is required to include at least one drug in every non-elective therapeutic
                   category.

                   12.7.7 Vision Care
                   Medical expense policies cover disease and injury to the eyes, but not routine eye care and vision
                   correction. This coverage gap can be filled with a vision care plan, which covers:

                          ■ eye examinations;
                          ■ cost of lenses and frames;
                          ■ cost of contact lenses; and
                          ■ other corrective items.
                   Typically, vision care plans operate within a network of optometrists and eyeglass providers. The
                   insured must use this network to receive benefits. Co-payments and certain limitations may apply. For
                   example, the plan may pay for only one eye exam and one set of lenses every two years, and there may
                   be a limit on the amount the plan will pay toward frames or prescription sunglasses.

                   12.7.8 Hearing Insurance
                   Most comprehensive health insurance policies do not cover costs related to hearing loss. These limited
                   plans may provide coverage for hearing exams and some or all of the cost for hearing aids.

                   12.7.9 Short-Term Medical Expense Plans
                   A short-term medical policy is sold as a means of temporary health insurance coverage. For example,
                   a person may be in the waiting period for their group insurance and need temporary coverage. The
                   length of coverage is typically 90 days, 6 months, or 12 months. These policies are not renewable and
                   must be qualified for. The insured may only apply for one additional policy, which can be refused by the
                   insurer if claims were filed under the previous short-term policy. These plans offer short-term limited
                   benefits at a low cost.

                              12.8 COMMON HEALTH INSURANCE EXCLUSIONS

                                  12.8.1 Intentional Self-Inflicted Injuries
                                  Health insurance is designed to cover unforeseen accidents or sickness not intentional injury or illness.

                                  12.8.2 War or Act of War
                                  Excluded regardless of service in the military.

                                  12.8.3 Elective Cosmetic Surgery
                                  Cosmetic surgery is not considered to be health related and is typically excluded. However, if treatment
                                  is required due to accident or birth defect, the coverage may apply.

                                  12.8.4 Workers Compensation
                                  Injury or illness that is work related is normally not covered by health insurance but is covered by

                                  This exclusion is similar to the intentional loss exclusion.

                                13.1 INTRODUCTION
                                    The Affordable Care Act was passed by Congress and signed into law by President Obama on March 23,
                                    2010. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court made the decision to uphold the law. The health care law
                                    includes reforms to the affordability, quality, and availability of health insurance, and regulations for
                                    both public and private health insurance companies.

                                    In this unit, you will learn the federal Affordable Care Act (ACA) details. It is important to know
                                    that some state insurance laws are more generous than the Affordable Care Act (ACA). Please read
                                    the Kaplan state law supplement and reference your state exam content outline for insurance law and
                                    regulation exam material that is specific to your state.

                     Note: Some state insurance laws are more generous than the Affordable Care Act (ACA). State specific
                     insurance law and regulation exam material is covered in the Kaplan state law supplement or the state

                     The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was signed into law by President Obama in 2010. The law has also
                     been referred to as Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), Obamacare, or Health
                     Care Reform. Some ACA provisions were implemented in 2010, while others happened later. Health
                     insurance reforms that began in 2010 are:

                              ■ no lifetime dollar limits or annual dollar limits on essential health benefits (EHBs);
                              ■ no rescissions (cancellations), except for fraud;
                              ■ specific preventive services are covered free of charge to insured;
                              ■ dependent coverage until a child’s 26th birthday; and
                              ■ pre-existing conditions must be covered for children under age 19.
                     Health insurance reforms that began January 1, 2014, are:

                              ■ pre-existing conditions must be covered for all eligible individuals (not just children);
                              ■ guaranteed issue of health insurance policies;
                              ■ no discrimination based on gender and health status, or due to pre-existing conditions;

                              ■ health insurance exchanges or marketplaces;

                                13.3.1 Grandfathered and Nongrandfathered Plans
                                A grandfathered health policy is one that existed prior to the Affordable Care Act. Costs cannot be
                                increased and benefits may not be reduced on these policies. A grandfathered plan is not required
                                to comply with some of the consumer protections of the ACA that apply to other health plans.
                                Nongrandfathered plans must comply with all rules and laws of the ACA.

                                The following consumer protections apply to all plans (grandfathered and nongrandfathered):

                                      ■ Lifetime dollar limits cannot be applied to essential health benefits.
                                      ■ A policy cannot be canceled solely because of an honest mistake on an application.
                                      ■ Dependent coverage must be extended to adult children until age 26.
                                Group plans and grandfathered plans are NOT required to:

                                      ■ provide certain recommended preventive services for free;
                                      ■ offer new protections when an insured is appealing claims and coverage denials; or
                                      ■ allow any choice of health care providers access to emergency care.
                                Grandfathered individual health plans are NOT required to:

                                      ■ phase out annual dollar limits on essential health benefits (dollar limits can remain); or
                                      ■ eliminate pre-existing condition exclusions for children under 19 years old (pre-existing
                                        conditions can be excluded).

                   13.3.2 Individual Mandate
                   U.S. citizens and legal residents are required to have qualifying health care coverage (minimum
                   essential coverage). Insurance provided by employers satisfies this universal health insurance mandate.
                   Individuals who lose or choose not to purchase qualifying coverage must pay a tax penalty. The Tax
                   Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA) did not repeal the individual mandate. The individual mandate is still
                   law. However, starting in 2019, the TCJA reduced the penalty to $0 and 0%, meaning that there is no
                   monetary penalty if an individual does not comply with the mandate.

                   Exemptions to the individual mandate may be granted for financial hardship, religious objections,

                   13.3.3.2 Emergency Medical Services
                   The ACA provides that emergency services are essential health benefits (EHBs). When an emergency
                   occurs, no pre-authorization may be demanded by insurers, whether the insured seeks help in-network
                   or out-of-network. Out-of-network providers who provide emergency services must comply with
                   normal cost-sharing requirements and may not impose administrative requirements or coverage limits
                   that are more restrictive than emergency services provided in-network.

                   13.3.3.5 Metal Tiers (Categories)
                   The ACA standardized the types of benefits and cost sharing allowed in health plans offered through
                   the Health Insurance Marketplace into four levels of coverage. Each plan level must cover the same
                   minimum essential health benefits. Individual and small group health plans categorize plans into one of
                   four different metal tiers. The tiers represent the average portion of expected costs a plan will cover for
                   an average population (a.k.a. actuarial value). The following are the percentages the plans will spend, on
                   average:

                           ■ Bronze plan—60%
                           ■ Silver plan—70%
                           ■ Gold plan—80%
                           ■ Platinum plan—90%
                   The higher the amount of coverage, the higher the premium will be for the insured.

                     13.3.4 Health Benefit Exchanges/Marketplaces
                     ACA requires states to have a health insurance exchange operated by either the state or the federal
                     government. Individuals, families, and small businesses can access, view, and sign up for health
                     insurance plans using the federal government’s Health Insurance Marketplace at www.healthcare.gov.

                     Initial enrollment in the plans available through the exchange began before the ACA was enacted.
                     Individuals and families have an annual open enrollment each year. Special enrollment periods are
                     available following certain qualifying events including:

                              ■ Marriage
                              ■ Birth or adoption of a child

                              Qualified health plans (QHP) are insurance plans sold on the health insurance exchange. QHPs provide
                              essential health benefits, follow established limits on cost-sharing (like deductibles, co-payments, and
                              out-of-pocket maximum amounts), and meet other requirements.

                                    ■ QHPs are only available on the health insurance exchange and are the only plans that provide
                                      premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions for eligible individuals.

                   13.3.4.2 Subsidies
                   To help defray the cost of health care purchased via the exchanges, the law offers subsidies that vary
                   based on an individual or family’s household income. The subsidy could be in the form of advanced
                   premium tax credits (APTCs) that may be applied to lower the insured’s monthly premiums or cost-
                   sharing reductions such as lower co-payment, coinsurance, and out-of-pocket limits. The cost-sharing
                   reduction is only available through a health plan from the silver metal tier plan category. When the
                   insured applies through an exchange, their identity and income is verified and compared to federal
                   poverty level incomes. The exchange calculates what subsidies are available (if any).

                                Employers are required to inform employees about their rights to affordable coverage and possible
                                subsidies. Access to coverage can be either via plans offered through employment or through the health
                                exchange individually. A Department of Labor notice entitled “New Health Insurance Marketplace
                                Coverage: Options and Your Health Coverage” should be distributed in the workplace.

                                13.3.5.2 Employer Mandate – Employer Shared Responsibility
                                Employers with 50 or more full-time employees (FTE) or full-time equivalents must pay a $2,000
                                penalty per full-time employee if the employer does not offer health coverage and at least one full-
                                time employee receives a federal premium subsidy for coverage purchased through a health insurance
                                exchange.

                                Employers with 50 or more full-time employees that offer coverage but have at least one full-time
                                employee receiving a premium subsidy will pay the lesser of $3,000 (indexed annually) for each
                                employee receiving a premium subsidy, or $2,000 (indexed annually) for each full-time employee
                                (excluding the first 30 employees).

                                Employers with less than 50 full-time employees are exempt from the above penalties.

                   13.3.5.3 Health Care Tax Credit for Small Employers
                   Small employers and small tax-exempt organizations can get tax credits to help offset the cost of the
                   company’s health plan premium contribution. The maximum credit is 50% of premiums paid for small
                   business employers and 35% of premiums paid for small tax-exempt employers.

                   To be eligible for the credit, a small employer must pay premiums on behalf of employees enrolled in a
                   qualified health plan offered through the Small Business Health Options Program (SHOP) Marketplace
                   or qualify for an exception to this requirement. The credit is available to eligible employers for two
                   consecutive taxable years.

                   The credit is targeted to help employers with low and moderate income workers afford to offer
                   employees health insurance coverage. The eligibility formula is based on the number of full-time
                   equivalent employees, not the total number of employees. Employers must have less than 25 FTE
                   employees and cover at least 50% of the cost of employee-only (not family or dependent) health care
                   coverage for each employee.

                                14.1 INTRODUCTION
                                    As you learned in earlier units, policies are legal documents that are written to protect the interests
                                    of both the insurance company and consumers. In the past, this was especially true regarding health
                                    insurance policies.

                                    The Uniform Individual Accident and Sickness Policy Provisions Law standardized contract
                                    language in individual accident and health policies. By providing consistent information written
                                    using understandable terms, consumers can more easily understand the health products they seek to
                                    purchase.

                                    This unit introduces required, optional, and other provisions found in health insurance policies such
                                    as required time frames for insureds and insurers to provide proof of loss notices, claims notices, grace
                                    periods, and reinstatement provisions.

                14.2               LEARNING OBJECTIVES

                      After successfully completing this unit, you should be able to:

                           ӽ identify the 12 uniform required health insurance policy provisions;
                           ӽ identify the 10 optional health insurance policy provisions; and
                           ӽ identify the five other health insurance provisions.


        14.3 UNIFORM POLICY PROVISIONS—HEALTH INSURANCE
                   The following 12 standard provisions are MANDATORY in every insurance contract as directed by
                   the Uniform Health Insurance Policy Provision. Insurance companies are not required to use the
                   exact wording of these provisions, they are allowed to reword them as long as the wording is not less
                   favorable to the insured.

                   14.3.1 Entire Contract; Changes
                   This provision states that the insurance policy represents a contract between the insurer and the insured
                   and consists of:

                           ■ application—copy of the application, if attached to the policy;
                           ■ insurance policy—the actual insurance contract itself; and
                           ■ riders (endorsements), any other papers or amendments attached to the policy.
                   In order for something to be included in the contract, it must be in writing, and it must be attached to
                   the policy.

                   An agent or producer may not change a policy or waive any of its provisions. For a change to be made,
                   it must be approved in writing by an executive officer of the insurance company and attached to the
                   policy in the form of an amendment.

                                14.3.2 Time Limit on Certain Defenses (Incontestability Clause)
                                This provision states that after two years from the date of policy issue, no misstatements, except for
                                fraudulent misstatements made by the applicant in the application for the policy, shall be used to void
                                the policy or deny a claim for loss after this time period. Fraudulent statements are grounds to contest
                                a policy at any time. In addition, the policy cannot deny a claim or reduce benefits on the grounds that
                                an illness or a condition was pre-existing after the policy has been in force for two years. This does not
                                prevent an insurer from specifically excluding coverage for a certain condition, but to be excluded, the
                                condition must be named or specifically described in the policy when it is written and is referred to as
                                an impairment waiver or rider.

                                NOTE: The federal Affordable Care Act (ACA) eliminated pre-existing condition exclusions for
                                medical expense policies affected by ACA. However, it is important to note that pre-existing condition
                                exclusions are still allowed for disability policies, long-term care insurance, Medicare supplements, and
                                limited-benefit policies.

                                A grace period is a specified time following the due date of a premium payment in which the premium
                                has not been paid. A loss that occurs during the grace period would be covered minus the premium
                                that was due.

                                The grace periods are as follows:

                                       ■ 7 days—weekly premium policies;
                                       ■ 10 days—monthly premium policies; or
                                       ■ 31 days—all other policies (annually, semiannually, or quarterly).

                   14.3.4 Reinstatement
                   If the premium on the health policy is not paid by the end of the grace period, the policy will lapse
                   and coverage will terminate. The policy is reinstated when the delinquent payment is accepted by the
                   insurer or its agent. If the insurer requires a reinstatement application to be submitted, a conditional
                   receipt will be issued for the premium and reinstatement is effective on approval of the application.
                   Coverage is automatically reinstated 45 days after the application is submitted if the insurer has not
                   disapproved the application and notified the applicant by that time. The premium may be applied to a
                   previous period of unpaid coverage, but that unpaid period may not be more than 60 days before the
                   date of reinstatement.

                   Once a policy is reinstated, there is a 10-day probationary period for sickness coverage. There is no
                   probationary period for accident coverage.

                   14.3.9 Payment of Claims
                   This provision states how and to whom payments are to be made. All benefits are payable to the insured
                   while they are alive unless the policy designates a different payee. Death benefits will be paid to either:

                           ■ the named beneficiary, or
                           ■ the insured’s estate if no beneficiary is named or the beneficiary is deceased.
                   If the insured was receiving monthly benefits and some accrued benefits remain after the insured’s
                   death, they will be paid to the beneficiary or the insured’s estate.

                   Policies may also include an optional provision allowing payment of up to $1,000 in benefits to any
                   relative of the insured or beneficiary by blood or marriage that appears to be entitled to them. A second
                   optional provision can allow the payment of benefits directly to a medical provider.

                                                if the insured changes occupations.

                                                If the insured changes to a more hazardous occupation, the insurer will reduce benefits to
                                                whatever the premium would have purchased at the higher risk occupation.

                                                If the insured changes to an occupation classified as less hazardous. The insurer will reduce the
                                                premium rate accordingly and return the excess pro rata unearned premium to the insured.

                                 The insurer may cancel a policy at any time by giving the insured five days written notice. If an
                                 insured cancels a policy, cancellation is effective when written notice is received by the insurer.
                                 In either case, cancellation does not affect any pending claim.

                                 If the insurer cancelled the policy, unearned premium will be returned to the insured on a pro
                                 rata basis. If the insured cancelled the policy, the insurer is allowed to calculate the unearned
                                 premium on a short rate basis, unearned premium minus company expenses will be returned to
                                 the policyowner.

        14.5 OTHER HEALTH INSURANCE PROVISIONS

                   14.5.1 Right to Examine (Free Look)
                   When a policy is delivered to the insured, they have the right to look it over and decide whether or not
                   to keep it. If the policy is not wanted for any reason, it may be returned for a full refund of premium.
                   The most common health insurance free-look period is 10 days. However, long-term care insurance
                   and Medicare supplements have 30-day free-look periods. If the policy is returned during the free look,
                   the contract is void and the insurer is not liable for any claim.

                   14.5.4 Renewability
                   Health policies have to be renewed periodically. The policyowner always has the right to cancel a policy
                   or allow it to lapse.

                   Whether an insurer may refuse to renew a policy depends upon the renewability provision in the
                   policy. The more favorable the renewability provision is to the insured, the higher the premium. The
                   less favorable the provision is to the insured, the lower the premium.

                   The renewability provisions can be classified into five types. They are listed from the least favorable and
                   least expensive for the insured (cancellable) to the most favorable and most expensive for the insured
                   (non-cancelable):

                           ■ cancelable; the insurer can cancel it at any time;
                           ■ optionally renewable; the insurer has the option to renew or not for any reason on a premium due
                             or anniversary date. Premiums may be increased on the policy anniversary for a class of insureds;
                           ■ conditionally renewable; the insurer may terminate coverage but only for reasons not based on
                             the insured’s health such as reaching a certain age. Premiums may be increased on the policy
                             anniversary for a class of insureds;
                           ■ guaranteed renewable; the policy cannot be canceled except for non-payment of premium, and
                             premiums may increase on a renewal date if the insurer has raised premiums for all insureds in
                             that coverage classification; or
                           ■ non-cancelable; the insurer cannot cancel coverage (except for non-payment of premium) or raise
                             premiums.

                                    hold.

                                    This unit discusses disability income insurance, a product that provides supplementary income in the
                                    event of an illness or accident resulting in a disability that would prevent the insured from working at
                                    their regular employment.

        15.3 QUALIFYING FOR DISABILITY BENEFITS
                   The criteria needed for an individual to qualify for disability benefits are universal for most policies
                   with very rare exceptions.

                   Benefits can be paid only after meeting the requirements defined in the DI policy.

                   15.3.1 Inability to Perform Work Duties
                   Disability is defined as the inability to work.

                   Work can be categorized as:

                          ■ one’s own occupation, or
                          ■ any occupation.

                                15.3.1.1 Own Occupation
                                Under the own occupation definition, disability is defined as an insured’s inability to perform any or
                                all of the duties of their occupation at the time the disability begins. Lee is a page layout specialist and
                                loses three fingers on each hand in an accident. Under the own occupation definition, Lee is unable to
                                use the keyboard—a primary duty of his occupation, and is disabled.

                                15.3.1.2 Any Occupation
                                With the any occupation definition, an insured is disabled if they are unable to perform the duties
                                of any occupation for which they are reasonably qualified by education, training, or experience. Lee
                                personally could not format pages but he could teach others that skill. Using the any occupation
                                definition Lee would not qualify for disability benefits.

                                Some policies use both definitions—own occupation for a few years, then any occupation for the
                                remainder of the disability period.

                   15.3.2 Pure Loss of Income (Income Replacement Contracts)
                   An income replacement contract pays a benefit if the insured experiences a loss of income as a result
                   of suffering a covered illness or injury. The benefit trigger is the amount of income the insured is
                   receiving at the time of the claim.

                   Lee cannot work due to a disability and is not earning an income following his accident. He would
                   receive the full benefit under an income replacement contract. Lee was able to use a stylus and voice-
                   activated software to proofread documents. The proofreading job did not pay as well as his formatting
                   job. His income replacement contract would pay part of its benefit so that the combination of Lee’s
                   earnings and the benefit would replace a specified percentage of his former earnings.

                   15.3.3 Presumptive Disability
                   Presumptive disability is a condition that automatically qualifies insureds for disability benefits
                   whether or not they can work. Conditions generally considered to be presumptive disabilities include:

                           ■ loss of or loss of use of any two limbs;
                           ■ total and permanent blindness in both eyes;
                           ■ total loss of speech; and
                           ■ total loss of hearing in both ears.
                   If Lee’s right arm and leg are severed in an accident; he is presumptively disabled. However, if only his
                   left leg is lost, he is not considered disabled because only one limb is involved.

                   Presumptive disability may also be determined using the loss of earnings test. The insured’s level of
                   earnings before disability is compared to the level of earnings after disability. If post-disability earnings
                   fall below pre-disability earnings by a given percentage, the insured is considered totally disabled and
                   eligible for a full benefit even if he or she is earning some income.

                   15.4.1 Basic Total Disability Plans
                   15.4.1.1 Benefits (Monthly Indemnity)
                   When an individual qualifies for benefits, disability income plans pay a monthly amount to make up
                   for lost earnings due to the insured’s inability to work. The benefit is referred to as an indemnity—it
                   returns the insured to their original financial condition before the loss.

                   benefits begin. The elimination period may be thought of as a kind of deductible – a time deductible
                   rather than a dollar deductible. The elimination period keeps the insurance company from paying
                   claims for short term or temporary disabilities. When the elimination period is satisfied, benefits begin
                   and they are not paid retroactively.

                   Elimination periods may be 30, 60, 90, or 180 days or longer, depending on the time period selected.
                   A longer elimination period would reduce the insurance premium, and make the disability income
                   policy more affordable.

                   15.4.1.3 Benefit Period
                   Benefits are paid during the disability period or until the end of a specified period of time called the
                   benefit period. Typical benefit periods are one year, two years, five years, and to age 65

                   The longer the benefit period, the higher the policy premium.

                                Disabled insureds may also receive benefits from Workers’ Compensation or other government
                                programs. During the planning process, the agent/producer must account for the possibility of an
                                insured receiving too many benefits because this can encourage malingering. The other possibility is
                                receiving benefits that do not meet the individual’s income needs.

                   15.4.2.2 Social Insurance Supplements (SIS)
                   The Social Insurance Supplement (SIS) rider is a monthly benefit. For those receiving a benefit for
                   total disability this rider pays for additional benefits, less any legislated benefits like Social Security
                   or Workers’ Compensation for the same period of time. The payment is in addition to other benefits
                   payable under the insurance policy.

                   Social Insurance Supplement rider benefits continue only as long as regular policy benefits are payable:

                           ■ during the policy’s benefit period, and
                           ■ while the insured remains disabled.

                                Insurers offer reduced benefits for individuals who are impaired, but not totally disabled, and return to
                                work.

                                15.4.3.1 Partial Disability Benefits
                                Partial disability means the person can perform some, but not all, of the essential duties of his or her
                                occupation. The partial disability benefit is 50% of the total disability benefit. Partial disability benefits
                                are paid for a relatively short period—commonly three or six months. An individual may qualify for
                                these benefits either as a result of suffering a partially disabling illness or injury and returns to work in
                                a reduced capacity.

                   15.4.3.2 Residual Disability Benefits
                   Residual disability benefits are another alternative for partial disability. These benefits are paid when
                   the insured cannot perform some of the duties of his or her occupation and are based on the amount of
                   income lost rather than 50% of the total disability benefit.

                   To receive residual disability benefits, the insured’s earnings must be reduced by a stated percentage due
                   to the disability; example -20%. If the reduced income is less than the stated percentage, no benefit is
                   payable.

                   If earnings meet or exceed the stated percentage, then the loss is multiplied by the total disability
                   benefit to determine the benefit payment. For example, if earnings are reduced by 40% due to the
                   disability, and the monthly disability benefit is $1,000, the insured would receive $400 each month in
                   residual disability benefits.

                   Residual disability benefits can be paid whether the insured is working full-time or part-time, and are
                   paid throughout the benefit period as long as the insured’s income is reduced.

                   15.4.4 Recurrent Disability
                   The recurrent disability provision protects employees who return to work, but become disabled again
                   for the same or a related cause. If this situation occurs within a certain period of time, the insured is
                   considered still disabled from the original disability and is not subject to a new elimination period.

                   This provision encourages employees to return to work without the fear of losing benefits if their
                   disability continues.

                   Judy has a disability income insurance policy with a 90 day recurrent provision. She is disabled by
                   severe back pain, receives benefits, and returns to work on February 1. On April 1, back pain again
                   prevents Judy from working, and she begins receiving benefits immediately because of the 90-day
                   recurrent provision.

                   With recurrent disability, if Judy’s second period of disability had been brought on by a something
                   other than back pain, she would have had to wait until the elimination period had passed to begin
                   receiving benefits.

                                               occupation. Regardless of income lost, Rachelle will receive 50% of the benefit for total

                                15.4.5.1 Cost-of-Living Adjustment (COLA) Rider
                                Inflation will impact the purchasing power of disability benefits over time and for this reason most
                                insurers offer an optional cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) rider. The benefit received by a disabled
                                insured is increased automatically to match increases in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Typically,
                                cost-of-living adjustments are made every 12 months for as long as the insured receives disability
                                benefits.

                     15.4.5.2 Future Increase Option (FIO) Rider
                     The future increase option (FIO) rider allows insureds to buy additional amounts of disability income
                     insurance coverage at stated future times without having to provide proof of insurability. The rate for
                     the additional coverage will be based on the insured’s attained age at the time of purchase, not the age
                     when the policy was originally issued.

                     This benefit has some limitations. To avoid over-insurance, the insured is able to buy only a
                     predetermined amount of additional coverage at each option date. Also, the insured’s earned income
                     must have increased to the point that the additional coverage is needed.

                     The number of purchase option dates is also limited. Usually, the rider provides option dates every
                     three years from ages 25 to 50.

                                15.4.5.3 Relation of Earnings to Insurance
                                Under the relation of earning to insurance provision, the insurer can reduce the benefit paid to a
                                disabled insured if the insured’s income is less than when they bought the policy. The insurer will base
                                the amount of the benefit on the insured’s average income over a previous 24 month period.

                                Benefit reductions are made in proportion to the drop in the insured’s earnings. If earnings have fallen
                                20% since the policy was purchased; the benefit will be reduced by 20%. The insurer will refund a
                                portion of the insured’s premium representing the decrease in coverage.

                                15.4.6.1 Accidental Death and Dismemberment (AD&D)
                                The AD&D rider pays the principal sum, the full benefit, if the insured dies or loses two limbs or the
                                sight in both eyes in an accident. The capital sum, one-half of the principal sum, is paid if the insured
                                loses one limb or the sight in one eye.

                                When attached to a disability income insurance policy, the benefit is usually expressed as a multiple of

                   15.4.6.2 Rehabilitation Benefit
                   The rehabilitation benefit pays for vocational training to prepare insureds for a new occupation when
                   they are totally disabled and unable to return to their normal occupation.

                   If the insured decides to get into an insurer-approved vocational rehabilitation program, then total
                   disability benefits will continue as long as the insured actively participates in the program and remains
                   disabled.

                                15.4.7.1 Return of Premium
                                A return of premium rider provides for the return of a percentage of premiums paid (usually 80%)
                                for a stated time period (usually every 10 years). The amount of any benefits paid during that period is
                                subtracted from the refund amount.

                                The refund is made every 10 years and at age 65 or the date of death. Essentially, for an additional
                                premium, the policyholder is guaranteed to get back 80% of his or her premium either in claims,
                                premium refunds, or a combination of both.

                   15.4.9 Unique Aspects of Disability Underwriting
                   15.4.9.1 Occupational Considerations
                   The insured’s occupation is the most important factor in underwriting disability income insurance. Less
                   hazardous occupations present a much lower risk for injuries. For this reason, physicians, attorneys,
                   and other professionals get better rates and more favorable definitions of disability than construction,

                                    warehouse, and industrial workers. Some occupations, such as firefighters, roofers, and high-rise
                                    window washers, may not be insurable at all.

                                    15.4.9.2 Benefit Limits
                                    Insurers are careful to limit the amount of coverage they offer to an individual. and will generally limit
                                    the amount to no more than 65% or 70% of net income, or after tax earned income. Existing coverage
                                    from another policy will be subtracted from the amount an insurer is willing to issue.

                                    15.4.9.3 Policy Issuance Alternatives
                                    Insurers have alternatives for individuals who are uninsurable:

                                           ■ issue a rated-up policy—charge an additional premium to cover the increased risk; or
                                           ■ attach an impairment rider to the policy that eliminates coverage for a particular condition that
                                             makes the individual uninsurable.

                                    15.5.1 Group vs. Individual Plans
                                    A group disability policy is less expensive than an individual policy because the risk is spread over
                                    more participants. Benefits are often less in group policies, which accounts for the lower cost.

                                    Group plans often state the benefit amount as a percentage of the employee’s compensation while
                                    individual plans pay a specific dollar amount. In addition, group disability plans often provide two
                                    different types of coverage based on the benefit period: short-term disability (STD) and long-term
                                    disability (LTD).

                                    15.5.2 Short-Term Disability (STD)
                                    Short-term disability policies have short elimination periods—sometimes just a few days or perhaps no
                                    elimination period at all. The benefit period is normally 6 to 24 months. Benefit amounts are generally
                                    60% or 70% of the employee’s compensation.

                   15.5.3 Long-Term Disability (LTD)
                   Long-term disability plans are designed to begin paying a benefit when the short-term disability benefit
                   ends. The elimination period of the long-term plan is usually the same as the benefit period of the
                   short-term plan. Benefit periods are from two years up to age 65 and benefits are usually with benefit
                   payments from workers’ compensation and Social Security.

        15.6 BUSINESS DISABILITY INSURANCE

                   15.6.1 Key Person Disability Insurance
                   A key person is an important member of a business and their loss due to death or extended incapacity
                   could cause a financial loss for the company.

                   Key person disability income insurance pays a monthly benefit to a business to cover expenses for
                   additional help or outside services when an essential person is disabled.

                   The key person’s economic value to the business is determined in terms of the lost business income that
                   would occur to replace the key person for an extended period of time. The benefit amount may be paid
                   in a lump sum or in monthly installments. Generally, the policy’s elimination period will be 30 to 90
                   days, and the benefit period will be one or two years.

                   15.6.2 Business Overhead Expense (BOE) Policy
                   The purpose of a Business Overhead Expense policy is to cover certain overhead expenses that continue
                   when the business owner is disabled.

                   The policy will indemnify the business (not the owner) for such business expenses as rent, taxes,
                   insurance premiums, utility bills, and employees’ compensation, but not the owner’s or a partner’s
                   salary. By covering these expenses the business is able to keep its doors open and continue to operate.

                   Generally, Business Overhead Expense policies have elimination periods of 15 or 30 days and benefit
                   periods of one or two years. The average eligible overhead expenses of the business determine the
                   benefit amount of the policy.

                                    15.6.3 Disability Buy-Sell Insurance
                                    Disability income insurance can be used to fund an agreement to buy out the interest of a business owner
                                    or partner who becomes disabled and can no longer contribute to the business. The buyout, or buy-sell,
                                    agreement will specify the value or a method of determining the value of the disabled owner’s business
                                    interest. The disability insurance policy then provides the funds needed to execute the agreement.

                                    The benefits may be paid in a lump sum or in monthly installments. If the policy provides a monthly
                                    benefit, usually the benefit period will not exceed five years.

                                    One of the critical considerations in a disability buyout is the elimination period. At the end of the
                                    elimination period, the disability policy’s funds become available and the buyout plan is put into effect.
                                    At that point, the buyout is irreversible. A business owner or partner will want to avoid having to
                                    sell his or her business interest for a short-term disability. For this reason, the elimination period for
                                    disability buyout insurance will normally be one or two years.

                                    15.7.1 Qualifying for Benefits
                                    To qualify for Social Security disability benefits, someone must have paid Social Security payroll
                                    (FICA) taxes to earn at least 6 credits during the last 13 quarters to be currently insured. The number of
                                    needed credits increases with age up to age 62. Fully insured status is achieved when someone has paid
                                    into Social Security for 10 years, earning 40 credits.

                                    In addition, the person must meet Social Security’s definition of totally and permanently disabled, which
                                    means:

                                           ■ the person is unable to perform the duties of any occupation; and
                                           ■ the disability is expected to last for at least 12 months or end in death or total blindness.
                                    Once a person becomes eligible for disability, there is five month (5) waiting period to receive benefits
                                    that are not paid retroactively.

                   15.7.2 Benefits Available
                   Disability benefits are based on the individual’s primary insurance amount (PIA), calculated using
                   percentages of the person’s income over his or her working years. Benefits are not designed to replace a
                   worker’s total earnings.

                   Eligible beneficiaries receive a benefit expressed as a percentage of the worker’s PIA:

                           ■ a disabled worker receives a benefit equal to 100% of PIA;
                           ■ a spouse caring for the worker’s unmarried child under age 16 or disabled before age 22, receives
                             a benefit, equal to 50% of the worker’s PIA; or
                           ■ each unmarried child under age 18 (19 if in high school) or disabled before age 22 receives a
                             benefit equal to 50% of the worker’s PIA.
                   The total family benefit is capped by a maximum family benefit amount based on the worker’s average
                   earnings.

        15.8 WORKERS’ COMPENSATION
                   Workers’ compensation is a form of insurance providing wage replacement and medical benefits to
                   employees injured in the course of employment in exchange for mandatory relinquishment of the
                   employee’s right to sue the employer for negligence.

                   The workers’ compensation system is administered on a state-by-state basis, with a state governing
                   board overseeing the system.

                   Benefits are payable regardless of fault—the employee does not have to prove that the employer was
                   responsible. In return, the law considers workers’ compensation benefits to be the employee’s exclusive
                   remedy—in most cases, employees cannot sue the employer for damages if an injury or illness occurs.

                                16.1 INTRODUCTION
                                    Medical expense insurance is any program that helps pay for medical expenses, whether through
                                    privately purchased insurance, social insurance or a social welfare program funded by the government.

                                    Medical expense plans vary widely in coverage, benefits, and the methods used for claim payments.

                                    This unit will explore the different types of medical insurance plans and provide a general description
                                    of the benefits and available options.

        16.3 GENERAL CONCEPTS

                   16.3.1 Fee-for-Service vs. Prepaid
                   Traditionally, physicians and hospitals provided care on a fee-for-service basis—that is, each time
                   they provided a service, they were paid a fee in return. One of the new ideas that health maintenance
                   organizations (HMOs) brought to health care was providing service on a prepaid basis—that is,
                   individuals would pay the HMO a specified amount, and in return the HMO would agree to provide
                   whatever care the individual needed during the year. If a particular individual needed very little care
                   during the year, no money would be refunded. At the same time, if an individual needed a great deal of
                   care, no additional money would be charged.

                   16.3.2 Specified Coverages vs. Comprehensive Care
                   Comprehensive medical expense plans cover all those types of care in one plan. The most
                   comprehensive types of medical expense plans will cover preventive care and immunizations as well
                   as necessary medical treatment. HMOs were among the first health care providers to cover preventive
                   care.

                   16.3.3 Benefit Schedule vs. Usual/Customary/Reasonable Charges
                   Some medical expense policies pay providers for their services according to a benefit schedule. Each
                   type of service is listed with the amount of payment. If a provider bills more for a service than is shown
                   in the schedule, the patient must pay the difference.

                   Other medical expense policies pay providers according to what amount is usual, customary, and
                   reasonable to charge for that service in that geographic area. As long as the provider’s charge is in line
                   with the amount other providers in the area are charging for that service, the policy will pay the full
                   amount. However, if the provider’s charge is more than the usual, customary, and reasonable amount,
                   the patient may be billed for the difference.

                                16.3.4 Any Provider vs. Limited Choice of Providers
                                Under older health insurance plans, the insured could use any provider. Under modern managed care
                                plans, the choice of providers is limited to those participating in the managed care plan. For example,
                                HMOs only pay providers who are members of the HMO. The insured could use a non-HMO provider,
                                but they must pay for those visits.

                                Preferred provider organization (PPO) plans have a panel of physicians and hospitals under contract to
                                provide health care services and generally cover 80%–100% of the cost. Individuals who choose to use
                                other providers are covered for a smaller percentage of the visits, such as 60%.

                                16.3.5 Insureds vs. Subscribers/Participants
                                Customers can be the insured, subscriber or participant depending on the type of plan:

                                      ■ traditional fee-for-service plans, refer to customers as insureds because these plans are issued by
                                        insurance companies; and
                                      ■ prepaid plans refer to their customers as subscribers/participants, these plans are offered by
                                        entities consisting of the providers themselves, such as HMOs.

        16.4 TYPES OF MEDICAL EXPENSE PLANS
                   Choosing a health care plan comes down to cost and to comparing the monthly premium with the
                   amount of coverage available. Major medical insurance is designed to cover everything from routine
                   check-ups to catastrophic events. Basic health insurance, by contrast, is a cash reimbursement plan that
                   can pay for some, but not all types of medical services.

                   16.4.1 Basic Hospital, Medical, and Surgical Policies
                   Basic hospital, medical, and surgical policies were the original medical expense plans. They were
                   developed before today’s highly technical equipment and expensive treatments existed. Basic hospital,
                   medical, and surgical policies are characterized by:

                          ■ low coverage limits, and
                          ■ first-dollar coverage (no deductible).
                   Coverage and payment limits for basic hospital, medical, and surgical plans were listed individually
                   for in-hospital benefits, miscellaneous hospital benefits, surgical, physician, and nursing services.
                   If a procedure or service was not on that list it was not covered. If expenses exceeded the scheduled
                   payment limit the insured paid the difference.

                   The good news with this coverage was the insured did not have immediate “out of pocket” expenses;
                   deductibles, co-pays, and co-insurance were not included in these plans. However the limit of coverage
                   was low and the bad news was the insured frequently paid “out of pocket” on the back end.

                              16.4.2 Major Medical Insurance
                              Major medical insurance covers a much broader range of medical expenses with fewer gaps and
                              provides higher maximum limits. These more expensive policies are divided into two general groups.

                                    ■ Supplemental major medical insurance packages together a basic plan and major medical
                                      coverage. The basic plan will pay covered expenses with no deductible, up to the basic plan
                                      policy limits, then the major medical coverage kicks-in. When leaving the basic plan, because the
                                      limits are reached, the insured must pay a corridor deductible to begin using the major medical
                                      coverage.
                                    ■ Comprehensive major medical insurance is a stand-alone plan and benefits are available after
                                      the deductible is satisfied. Another feature is the concept of coinsurance, which is the sharing
                                      between the insurer and insured of covered expenses that exceed the deductible amount. The
                                      sharing ends when the stop-loss limit (maximum out-of-pocket limit) is reached.

                   16.4.2.1 Covered Expenses
                   Major medical insurance, whether supplemental or comprehensive, covers a wide range of medical
                   expenses. Though covered expenses can vary depending on the particular policy, they typically include
                   the following:

                          ■ hospital inpatient room and board, including intensive and cardiac care,
                          ■ hospital medical and surgical services and supplies,
                          ■ physicians’ diagnostic, medical, and surgical services,
                          ■ other medical practitioners’ services,
                          ■ nursing services, including private-duty service outside a hospital,
                          ■ anesthesia and anesthetist services,

                          ■ prescription drugs administered in the hospital,
                          ■ blood and blood plasma,
                          ■ oxygen and its administration,
                          ■ dental services resulting from injury to natural teeth,

                          ■ home health care services,
                          ■ prosthetic devices when initially purchased,
                          ■ casts, splints, trusses, braces, and crutches,

                     16.4.2.2 Deductibles
                     Deductibles are one way major medical expense insurance shares costs with insureds to keep premiums
                     for coverage affordable.

                     The deductible requires the insured to pay a certain amount of their medical expenses each calendar
                     year before coverage begins. For example, if an insured had a $500 deductible and the cost of medical
                     treatment received totaled $750, they would pay $500. The remaining $250 would be eligible for
                     payment by the insurer.

                     In addition to an individual deductible, policies that cover an entire family usually have a family
                     deductible. For example, the individual deductible is $500, and the family deductible is $1,000. A family
                     of six would pay no more than $1,000, not $3,000 that would apply if each individual had to pay a $500
                     deductible.

                     With supplemental major medical insurance, the deductible kicks in after the basic policy limits are
                     reached. The corridor deductible applies to begin using the supplemental plan and another deductible
                     would apply.

                     For example, Ray has a basic medical policy with a $1,000 limit and supplemental major medical
                     insurance with a $500 deductible. Ray exceeds the $1,000 medical expense plan limit, pays a corridor
                     deductible and any expenses that exceed $1,000 will be picked up by the supplemental major medical
                     policy after its deductible has been satisfied.

                     16.4.2.3 Coinsurance
                     Coinsurance is a cost-sharing feature that keeps major medical insurance affordable. The insured pays
                     a certain percentage of medical expenses after the deductible has been satisfied. Different coinsurance
                     arrangements are available, the most common is 80-20, the insurer pays 80% and the insured pays 20%
                     during the time the sharing arrangement applies.

                     Dick has major medical insurance with a $500 deductible and an 80/20 coinsurance clause. He has a
                     $1,200 medical expense and pays the $500 deductible, plus his 20% coinsurance of the remaining $700
                     ($140). Dick’s total medical expense is $640 and the insurer pays the remaining $560.

                     16.4.2.4 Stop-Loss Limits
                     Major medical policies often include a stop-loss limit, the insured is no longer required to pay
                     coinsurance when medical expenses exceed this amount.

                     If Dick had a stop-loss limit of $5,000, he would no longer be required to pay coinsurance after medical
                     expenses totaled $5,500. At that point, he would have paid $1,000 in coinsurance ($5,000 x 20%) plus
                     the $500 deductible.

                     16.4.2.5 Maximum Out of Pocket
                     Major medical policies include a maximum out of pocket; the deductible plus the insured’s
                     coinsurance percentage times the stop-loss limit. Using the above example, Dick’s maximum out of
                     pocket limit would be $1,500: the $500 deductible + the $1,000 (5,000 × 20%) coinsurance amount.

                                17.1 INTRODUCTION
                                    The Health Maintenance Organization Act of 1973, which began as an experiment, changed the
                                    landscape of the health care delivery system permanently. The act was introduced as an alternative
                                    to the existing fee-for-service method of payment for health services. In the following decades, other
                                    forms of managed care emerged, such as Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) and Point-of-Service
                                    (POS) plans.

                                    This unit discusses the various plans, their range of services, and the various types of providers.

        17.3 HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS

                   17.3.1 General Characteristics
                   Health maintenance organizations (HMOs) are managed care entities. They departed from the
                   traditional health care delivery and payment system in several key respects. HMOs provide both the
                   health care service and the health care financing, while traditional health care insurance companies
                   provide only the financing.

                   17.3.1.1 Combined Health Care Delivery and Financing
                   In the traditional system, the insurance company acts as financing entity, collecting premiums and
                   either paying the bulk of the patients’ medical bills or reimbursing their medical expenses. Insurers
                   assumed a certain amount of risk by hoping premiums would be sufficient to pay for provided medical
                   care.

                   Health maintenance organizations changed this procedure by combining both the provision and the
                   financing of health care into one entity. HMOs are made up of an array of physicians, hospitals, and
                   other medical providers who offer a full range of health care services. Individuals pay for services
                   directly to the HMO, and it agrees to provide needed medical care. The HMO is a financing entity and
                   assumes that the cost of medical care will not exceed the subscription fees.

                   17.3.1.2 Prepayment for Health Care Services
                   HMOs are considered prepaid plans because the consumer (subscriber) pays a subscription fee in
                   advance for health care services they may need in the future. In addition to a co-payment paid by
                   the subscriber, the HMO pays a capitation fee to a health care provider. The capitation fee is a fixed
                   monthly fee paid to the healthcare provider based on the number of HMO members, not per HMO
                   subscriber visit or service.

                                17.3.1.3 Co-payments (Co-pays)
                                HMOs introduced the concept of co-payments, or co-pays instead of deductibles or coinsurance. A
                                co-pay is a relatively small, flat dollar amount that subscribers must pay for each doctor visit.

                                17.3.1.4 Gatekeeper Concept (Primary Care Physician)
                                Another way HMOs control overutilization of their services by subscribers is with the gatekeeper
                                concept. When subscribers join an HMO, they must choose a doctor with a general medical practice as
                                their primary care physician (PCP) and they must always see them first (except in emergencies) when
                                seeking medical care from the HMO.

                                Subscribers cannot see specialists without a referral from a primary care physician.

                                17.3.1.5 Limited Choice of Provider
                                HMO subscribers must choose a provider/physician under contract with the HMO. If a new
                                subscriber’s current physician is not under contract with the HMO, they must choose a doctor from the
                                HMO. In some cases, the individual’s current doctor may be able to join the HMO.

                                17.3.1.6 Limited Service Area
                                HMOs operate within a specific geographic area or designated service area such as a certain county or
                                within the surrounding area. Individual must live within the designated service area to subscribe to the
                                HMO.

                                17.3.2.1 Preventive Care
                                A major difference between HMOs and the traditional health care system is the emphasis on
                                preventive care. Traditional health insurance pays for the medical treatment of existing illnesses or
                                other conditions. HMOs seek to reduce the need for medical treatment by detecting conditions early
                                before they require more extensive treatment. Routine physicals, well-child care, immunizations, and
                                diagnostic screening are all included in the HMO subscription fee.

                   17.3.2.1.1 Emergency Care

                   HMOs must provide emergency care, including ambulance service, available 24-hours a day, and 365
                   days a year, within its designated service area. In addition, HMOs must reimburse subscribers for
                   emergency care obtained outside of the HMO’s designated service area from non-HMO providers.

                   17.3.2.2 Hospital Services
                   Inpatient hospital and physician care must be provided for a period per calendar year for treatment of
                   illness or injury. Hospital services must include the following:

                          ■ room and board,
                          ■ maternity care,
                          ■ general nursing care,
                          ■ use of operating room and facilities,
                          ■ use of intensive care unit,
                          ■ x-rays, laboratory, and other diagnostic tests,
                          ■ drugs, medications, and anesthesia, and
                          ■ physical, radiation, and inhalation therapy.

                   17.3.2.3 Other Services
                   HMOs must also provide for other basic office-based care provided by physicians and other medical
                   professionals such as diagnostic services, treatment services, short-term physical therapy and
                   rehabilitation services, laboratory and x-ray services, and outpatient surgery.

                   HMOs may include certain supplemental health care services or provide them for an additional fee,
                   such as:

                              17.4 PREFERRED PROVIDER ORGANIZATIONS
                                  Preferred provider organizations (PPOs) are another managed care entity. PPOs contract with a
                                  network of hospitals, physicians, laboratories, and other medical practitioners to provide medical
                                  services for a fee that is somewhat lower than the usual rate for that area. Individuals sign up to receive
                                  their medical care through the PPO in order to take advantage of those lower fees. The providers agree
                                  to accept a lower fee in order to have access to the PPO’s subscribers.

                                  PPOs operate on a fee-for-service rather than a prepaid basis like an HMO. PPO subscribers pay an
                                  insurance premium when they enroll in the PPO. PPO plans also have deductibles, coinsurance, and
                                  also co-pays. Out-of-pocket costs depend on the amount of care provided.

                   17.4.1 Open Panel vs. Closed Panel
                   HMOs are typically closed-panel, or closed network, entities subscribers must seek care only from
                   providers/physicians that belong to the HMO (except in out-of-network emergencies).

                   PPOs are typically open panel, or open network, entities and subscribers are not strictly limited to
                   the plans providers. The reimbursement percentage on care received from out-of-network providers
                   however is usually considerably lower (50% to 60% than that for in-network providers (80% to 90%)

                   17.4.2 Parties to the Provider Contract
                   A PPO is a risk-bearing entity separate from the providers of health care services. The relationship
                   between the PPO and its providers is contractual.

                   However, a PPO can be organized by a number of different types of organizations, including:

                           ■ insurance companies;
                           ■ Blue Cross/Blue Shield;
                           ■ a hospital or a group of hospitals;
                           ■ a group of physicians;
                           ■ an HMO;
                           ■ a large employer or group of employers; and
                           ■ a trade union.

        17.5 POINT-OF-SERVICE PLANS
                   A Point Of Service plan is a type of HMO that allows subscribers to obtain care from providers who
                   do not belong to the HMO as well as those who do. The name of the plan highlights the fact that
                   subscribers can choose their point of service.

                   If subscribers choose to access care within the HMO, they choose a primary care physician who acts as
                   a gatekeeper to the HMO’s network of providers. For this reason, POS plans are sometimes referred to
                   as gatekeeper PPOs. In-network care is covered by the subscriber’s prepaid fee. No billing is done and no
                   claim forms need to be completed.

                                    If subscribers choose to access care outside of the HMO, the plan operates like a PPO or traditional
                                    insurance plan:

                                          ■ there is no primary care physician who acts as a gatekeeper;
                                          ■ providers bill the individual a fee for services rendered, and the individual must submit a claim
                                            form to the HMO for reimbursement; and
                                          ■ subscribers are not reimbursed for 100% of their expenses but rather for only a percentage such
                                            as 60% or 80%, like a coinsurance requirement.
                                    Because subscribers are not limited to selecting only providers which belong to the HMO, POS plans
                                    are sometimes called open-ended HMOs.

                                    following:

                                          ■ provision of care on a fee-for-service basis;
                                          ■ billing and submission of claim forms;

                                          ■ ability to access to specialists without a referral.
                                    Some traditional insurance plans employ certain cost containment methods such as preauthorization,
                                    second surgical opinion, or utilization management. Some do not.

        17.7 HEALTH CARE COST CONTAINMENT (MANAGED CARE)
                   Traditionally, controlling health care costs was not thought to be an area of responsibility for insurers.
                   But as health care costs began to rise dramatically, insurers responded by implementing a number of
                   measures to make the delivery of health care more efficient and cost-effective. These measures came to
                   be known as managed care.

                   17.7.1 Cost Saving Measures
                   17.7.1.1 Preventive Care
                   One of the cost saving measures insurers implemented was to encourage preventive care. It is much
                   cheaper to prevent illnesses or to find and treat them in their early stages. Insurers began providing
                   coverage for regular physical exams, health screenings, and smoking cessation programs, and wellness
                   programs to provide access to experts in nutrition and exercise.

                                17.7.1.2 Reducing Hospital Care Costs
                                Insurers also implemented measures designed to reduce the amount spent on inpatient hospitalization,
                                which is the most costly type of medical care.

                                      ■ Outpatient Benefits Many procedures can be performed safely and effectively without the
                                        patient staying in the hospital overnight. Insurers began encouraging use of a hospital’s outpatient
                                        facilities by providing relatively higher levels of reimbursement for treatment received on an
                                        outpatient rather than an in-patient basis. In addition, insurers began approving payment for
                                        treatment received in ambulatory care centers other than hospital outpatient departments such
                                        as surgicenters and urgent care centers.
                                      ■ Second Surgical Opinion Doctors do not always agree on whether surgery is needed to treat a
                                        particular condition. Second surgical opinion allows or requires consultation with a doctor other
                                        than their attending physician to see if an alternative method of treatment would be desirable.
                                      ■ Preauthorization If treatment requiring hospitalization is recommended, precertification is
                                        required prior to obtaining the treatment.
                                      ■ Limits on Lengths of Stay In consultation with medical experts, insurers determined the
                                        appropriate number of days for various types of treatment. They limited payment to a certain
                                        number of days for a given procedure, assuming no complications.

                                        and cost-effective—level of care for some patients.

                                                      a hospital.
                                                    – Intermediate nursing facilities provide intermittent nursing care for patients who do not
                                                      need 24-hour supervision.
                                                    – Rehabilitative facilities provide a limited amount of medical care along with the personal
                                                      care necessary for patients to recover from major surgeries or serious injuries or illnesses.
                                                    – Home health care is provided by agencies that employ a staff of nurses that make visits to a
                                                      patient’s home on a regular basis. It is used when patients need some sort of ongoing medical
                                                      care but do not need supervision.

                   17.7.2 Utilization Management
                   Utilization management places oversight on the provision of medical care to make sure it is
                   appropriate and effective. This oversight can occur at any or all of the following points in the process.

                   Prospective review occurs before an expensive test or treatment recommended by a physician is
                   actually provided, requires a second opinion, or both. Information on the case is reviewed to determine
                   necessity and cost-effectiveness. This review process is referred to as precertification or preauthorization.

                   Concurrent review takes place while treatment is being provided. The insured’s hospital stay is
                   monitored to assure that everything is proceeding according to schedule and that the insured will be
                   released from the hospital as planned.

                   Retrospective review is done after treatment is complete. The outcome is evaluated to see if treatment
                   was effective and if anything could be changed to produce a better or most cost-effective outcome in the
                   future.

                                    provisions, and characteristics related to this area of insurance.

                     While individual insurance policies insure one person, group insurance policies cover many people
                     under one contract. That reduces the plan cost and lowers premiums. Group insurance premiums are
                     less than individual coverage.

                     The two parties in a group insurance contract are the insurer and the sponsoring group. The
                     policyholder/owner is the sponsoring group and it controls the master policy.

                     18.3.2 Certificate of Coverage
                     The individual members covered by the group plan are not parties to the group insurance contract and
                     have no authority to make decisions regarding the plan. Members receive a certificate of coverage that
                     provides evidence of coverage, who is covered by the plan, and summarizes the benefits.

                     18.3.3 Experience Rating vs. Community Rating
                     In general, the premium cost for group insurance may be based on experience rating or community
                     rating. Experience rating is a method of establishing the premium on the group’s previous claims
                     experience. The larger and more homogenous (similar) the group, the closer it comes to reflecting
                     standard mortality and morbidity rates.

                     In contrast, community rating sets premium costs by using the same rate structure for all subscribers to
                     a medical expense plan, no matter what their past loss experience has been.

                                18.4 TYPES OF ELIGIBLE GROUPS
                                    The general eligibility rule is; a group must have been formed for a purpose other than obtaining
                                    insurance for its members. This defines a natural group. The insurance plan must be incidental to the
                                    group rather than its primary reason for being.

                                    Group insurance eligibility is limited to only the following types of groups.

                                           ■ An employer may sponsor a group insurance plan for its employees. These are known as employer
                                             group plans. They are sometimes referred to as employee group plans.
                                           ■ A multiple employer trust (MET) is a group of small employers in the same industry who either
                                             form together in order to purchase group insurance as one entity or self-fund a plan.
                                           ■ Multiple Employment Welfare Arrangements (MEWAs) provide health and welfare benefits to
                                             two or more unrelated employers. The purpose is to provide affordable health coverage to small
                                             employers.
                                           ■ A labor union may sponsor a group insurance plan for its members, or two or more labor unions
                                             may join together to provide group insurance for their collective members. Labor union plans are
                                             sponsored under a Taft-Hartley trust.
                                           ■ A trade, professional, or other type of association may sponsor a group plan for its members.
                                             These are known as association group plans.
                                           ■ A lender, or creditor, may sponsor a group health (disability) insurance plan for its group of
                                             debtors. This is known as group credit disability insurance. Two features separate group credit
                                             insurance from other types of group insurance:
                                                         – while other types of group insurance may not be made payable to the sponsoring group,
                                                           group credit insurance can be; and
                                                         – the amount of coverage under a group credit insurance plan is limited to the amount of the
                                                           insured’s debt.

        18.5 EMPLOYER GROUP HEALTH INSURANCE

                   18.5.1 Underwriting Criteria
                   Group insurance underwriters do not evaluate the risk represented by each individual. They look at
                   the risk presented by the characteristics of the group and the plan as a whole. Once the group plan is in
                   force, premiums are based on the experience of the group and can change at each renewal.

                                                                                                      Unit 18    Group Health Insurance        381



                                Group underwriting means that individuals can enroll in a group insurance plan without providing
                                evidence of insurability. Rather than submitting an application that asks for medical information, each
                                individual submits an enrollment card with basic identifying information.

                                Group underwriting criteria includes the following.

                                      ■ Size of the group: larger groups can more likely avoid adverse selection. Small group = 2 to 50
                                        lives, Large group = 51 or more lives.
                                      ■ Composition of the group: ages, sex, and income of the members of the group will affect the
                                        potential benefits that will be paid.
                                      ■ Flow of members through the group: individuals joining and leaving the group on a regular
                                        basis reduces the risk of adverse selection.
                                      ■ Plan design: what will be covered, and for how much.
                                      ■ Contributory or noncontributory: employees pay part of the cost in contributory plans, and
                                        at least 75% of those eligible must participate in the plan; the employer pays the entire cost in a
                                        noncontributory plan, and 100% of eligible employees must participate.
                                      ■ Persistency: When employers keep their group coverage with the same insurer year after year, the
                                        insurer’s expenses are reduced.
                                      ■ Administrative capability: large employers can lower group premium costs by helping administer
                                        the plan and use the insurer for stop-loss coverage and/or claims processing.

                   18.5.2 Eligibility for Coverage
                   18.5.2.1 Employee Eligibility
                   Employers cannot discriminate with group benefits. All employees that are eligible can enroll regardless
                   of their age, handicaps, or sex. Pregnancy and maternity must be treated like any other covered
                   condition.

                   Employers can establish basic employment criteria. The employee must be:

                          ■ full-time, and
                          ■ actively at work—that is, not on disability leave or other inactive status.
                   Employers may also exclude union workers as a class, since their compensation and benefits are covered
                   by a collective bargaining agreement.

                   18.5.2.2 Dependent Eligibility
                   Coverage must also be made available to a participating employee’s spouse or children up to age 26.
                   This includes step-children and adopted children, and it applies whether or not the child is married or a
                   student. Coverage may also be made available to a participating employee’s dependent parents.

                   Many states require that children older than age 26 be covered by a plan if they are mentally or
                   physically disabled and unable to support themselves.

                   18.5.2.3 Probationary, or Waiting, Period
                   During a probationary period new employees must wait before they can enroll in an employer’s group
                   health insurance plan. Probationary periods typically range from one to six months.

                   18.5.2.4 Eligibility Period and Open Enrollment
                   When the probationary period ends, new employees can enroll in the group health insurance plan
                   during the eligibility or enrollment period, which is typically 30 or 31 days.

                   Most states require insurers to also offer an open enrollment period every year. Individuals who
                   declined coverage during the initial eligibility period can enroll in the health plan during this period
                   without providing evidence of insurability.

                   Late enrollees—individuals who want to enroll for coverage at any time other than the initial eligibility
                   period or an annual open enrollment period may be required to provide evidence of insurability.

                                18.5.3 Coordination of Benefits
                                Many working couples are covered as employees under their own employer’s plan, and each is also
                                covered as a dependent under their spouse’s plan. This type of double coverage can result in individuals
                                being over insured—which means the individual is able to collect benefits in excess of the amount of
                                the loss.

                                To avoid this situation, group health insurance policies contain a coordination of benefits provision
                                which says that if a loss is payable under two group health insurance plans, one plan will be considered
                                primary and the other will be considered secondary. The primary plan pays benefits up to its limit first,
                                the secondary insurance plan will pay up to its limit for costs not covered by the primary plan. The
                                provision describes how to determine which plan is primary and which is secondary.

                                With a married couple, the primary plan is the individual’s employer plan, and the secondary plan is
                                the spouse’s employer plan. For example, Philip and Kendra are married and have group coverage at
                                work. Both are covered under each person’s group plan. Under the coordination of benefits provision,
                                Phillip’s employer-sponsored plan is his primary coverage, and Kendra’s employer-sponsored plan is his
                                secondary coverage. Kendra’s employer-sponsored plan is her primary coverage, and Philip’s employer-
                                sponsored plan is her secondary coverage.

                                A different rule called the “birthday rule” is used for determining the primary plan if a married couple
                                has children. The parent whose birthday comes earliest during the year will use their plan as primary
                                coverage for their children. If Philip’s birthday was March 4 and Kendra’s was May 8, Philip’s plan would
                                be the primary payer for their children’s covered medical expenses.

                                18.6 MARKETING CONSIDERATIONS

                                    18.6.1 Advertising
                                    States regulate the marketing and advertising of accident and health insurance policies to ensure
                                    truthful and full disclosure of pertinent information when selling these policies. As a rule, the insurer is
                                    held responsible for the content of advertisements of its policies. Advertisements must:

                                           ■ not be misleading or obscure; and
                                           ■ clearly outline all policy exclusions or limitations on coverage as well as policy benefits.

                                    18.6.2 Regulatory Jurisdiction
                                    There are no regulatory jurisdiction issues when an employer purchases a group insurance plan from
                                    an insurer domiciled in the employer’ home state.. Many insurers and employers however do business
                                    in multiple states and for this reason the insurance regulator in each state involved would oversee these
                                    transactions.

                                    A group health insurance policy is regulated by the state in which it is delivered, assuming that state is
                                    also where the employer has its principal business office.

                                18.7 CHANGE OF INSURERS AND LOSS OF COVERAGE

                                    18.7.1 Coinsurance and Deductible Carryover
                                    When a group health insurance policy is replaced by another plan, the new insurers will allow
                                    coinsurance and deductibles paid under the old plan to count toward the new plans requirements. This
                                    eases the transition to the new plan for covered employees.

                                    18.7.2 No Loss, No Gain
                                    Many states have no loss, no gain statutes that require benefits for ongoing (disability) claims that
                                    started under an old plan to continue without imposing the new plan’s eligibility requirements.

                   18.7.3 Events That Terminate Coverage
                   Coverage under a group health insurance plan may be terminated when any of the following occur.

                           ■ The employer discontinues the plan or discontinues coverage for a certain class of employees.
                           ■ The group policy lapses because the employer did not pay the premium.
                           ■ The employee or their dependent’s coverage lapses because they did not pay the premium.
                           ■ A covered employee quits, is laid off, or they lose their full-time employment status.
                           ■ A spouse and children lose connection to the plan due to a divorce from the insured employee or
                             the employee dies, terminates employment, or otherwise becomes ineligible for coverage.
                           ■ A non-disabled dependent child reaches age 26.
                                                                                        Termination of Group Coverage

                              18.7.4 Extension of Benefits
                              Extension of benefits requires, by state laws, that benefits paid by an in-force policy continue after the
                              policy is terminated. Some states require an extension of benefits to a totally disabled member at the
                              time of policy discontinuance.

                              18.7.5 Continuation of Benefits
                              The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) is a federal law that requires
                              employers with 20 or more employees to allow former employees and their dependents to continue the
                              benefits provided by the employer’s group health insurance plan. Coverage may be continued for 18 to
                              36 months. Employees or dependents remain on the group plan but must pay the entire premium for
                              the coverage. COBRA specifies rates, coverage, qualifying events, qualifying beneficiaries, notification
                              procedures, and time of payment requirements for the continued insurance.

                              18.7.5.1 Qualifying Events
                              A qualifying event occurs when an employee, spouse, or dependent child lose coverage under the group
                              insurance contract. Qualifying events include:

                                   ■ death of a covered employee;
                                   ■ termination of a covered employee, except for gross misconduct;
                                   ■ reduction of work hours of a covered employee;
                                   ■ Medicare eligibility for a covered employee;
                                   ■ divorce or legal separation of a covered employee from the covered employee’s spouse;
                                   ■ termination of a child’s dependent status; and
                                   ■ bankruptcy of the employer.

                              18.7.5.2 Qualified Beneficiary
                              A qualified beneficiary is any individual covered under an employer-maintained group health plan on
                              the day before a qualifying event. Usually this includes:

                                   ■ covered employees,
                                   ■ spouse of covered employees, and
                                   ■ dependent children of covered employees, including children born or adopted during the first 18
                                     months of a benefit continuation period.

                              18.7.5.3 Notification Statements
                              Employers must provide notification statements to individuals eligible for COBRA continuation within
                              14 days. This notification must be provided when:

                                   ■ a plan becomes subject to COBRA;
                                   ■ an employee is covered by a plan subject to COBRA; and
                                   ■ a qualifying event occurs.
                              The company must notify new employees of their rights under COBRA when they are informed of
                              other employee benefits. Notification of an employee’s spouse or other dependents must be made in
                              writing and sent to the last known address of the spouse or dependent.

                     18.7.5.4 Duration of Coverage
                     The maximum period of coverage continuation for termination of employment or a reduction in
                     hours of employment is 18 months. For all other qualifying events, the maximum period of coverage
                     continuation is 36 months.

                     Certain disqualifying events can result in a termination of coverage before the specified time periods.
                     These disqualifying events and their dates are as follows:

                              ■ the first day a premium is overdue;
                              ■ the date the employer ceases to maintain any group health plan;
                              ■ the date on which the individual is covered by another group plan (even if coverage is less); and
                              ■ the date the individual becomes eligible for Medicare.
                     The group coverage must be the same the insured had while employed. The premium must also be
                     the same, except now the terminated employee must pay the entire premium, including any portion
                     previously paid by the employer. The terminated individual may also have to pay an additional amount
                     each month not exceeding 2% of the premium to cover the employer’s administrative expenses.

                     Continuation applies only to health benefits under COBRA.


        18.8 OMNIBUS BUDGET RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1989 (OBRA)
                     OBRA extended the minimum COBRA continuation of coverage period to 29 months for qualified
                     beneficiaries disabled at the time of termination. The disability must meet the Social Security definition
                     of disability. The plan can charge qualified beneficiaries an increased premium, up to 150% of the group
                     premium, during the 11-month disability extension (months 19 to 29).

        18.9 FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS FOR GROUP HEALTH
             INSURANCE

                     18.9.1 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
                              1. The state insurance exam content outline may still show HIPAA as an exam topic. It is important
                                 for students to know HIPAA for the exam. But, it is also important to understand that current
                                 federal law due to the Affordable Care Act (ACA) changed the preexisting conditions portion of
                                 HIPAA. ACA is discussed in Unit 13.
                              2. HIPAA took effect July 1, 1997. It ensured portability of group insurance coverage and included
                                 various mandated benefits that affect small employers, the self-employed, pregnant women, and
                                 the mentally ill.
                              3. Preexisting conditions A group health plan may not define a preexisting condition more
                                 restrictively than: A condition in which medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment was
                                 recommended or received during the six months prior to the enrollment date in the plan.
                                  a. A preexisting condition can be excluded for up to 12 months (18 months for a late enrollee).
                              4. Creditable coverage includes most health coverage, including coverage under a group health
                                 plan, an HMO, an individual health insurance policy, Medicaid, or Medicare. As long as there is
                                 not a break in creditable coverage of 63 or more days, an individual’s prior creditable coverage
                                 reduces the maximum preexisting condition exclusion period that the new group health plan can
                                 apply to that individual. This means if an individual had prior creditable coverage of 12 months
                                 or more (18 months if a late enrollee), and there was not a gap of 63 or more days between
                                 coverage on the prior plan and the new plan then the new plan would not be allowed to apply a
                                 preexisting condition exclusion.
                              5. Mandated Benefits HIPAA guarantees coverage for a 48-hour hospital stay for new mothers
                                 and their babies after a regular delivery (96 hours for a cesarean section birth). Also, it expands
                                 coverage for mental illness by requiring similar coverage for treatment of mental and physical
                                 conditions. The law eliminates insurance policy limits that apply only to mental health coverage.
                                 Small employers cannot be denied group health insurance coverage because one or more
                                 employees are in poor health.
                              6. Privacy Disclosures HIPAA imposes specific requirements on health care providers, insurers,
                                 and producers with respect to the privacy of the insureds’ health and medical information.
                                  a. The applicant must be given notice of the following
                                       ■ the insurer’s privacy practices;
                                       ■ the applicant’s rights to maintain privacy; and
                                       ■ the applicant’s opportunity to opt-out.
                                  b. The producer must provide the applicant with the Notice of Insurance Information Practices.

                                    interests of the participants’ beneficiaries. Much of the law deals with qualified pension plans, but some
                                    sections also apply to group insurance plans.

                                    18.10.1             Fiduciary Responsibility
                                    ERISA mandates very detailed standards for fiduciaries and other parties-in-interest of employee
                                    welfare benefit plans, including group insurance plans. This means that anyone with control over plan
                                    management or plan assets of any kind must discharge that fiduciary duty solely in the interests of the
                                    plan participants and their beneficiaries. Strict penalties are imposed on those who do not fulfill this
                                    responsibility.

                                    Reporting and Disclosure ERISA requires that certain information concerning any employee
                                    welfare benefit plan, including group insurance plans, be made available to plan participants, their
                                    beneficiaries, the Department of Labor, and the IRS. Examples of the types of information that must be
                                    distributed include:

                                           ■ a summary plan description to each plan participant and the Department of Labor;
                                           ■ a summary of material modifications that details changes in any plan description to each plan
                                             participant and the Department of Labor;
                                           ■ an annual return or report (Form 5500 or one of its variations) submitted to the IRS;
                                           ■ a summary annual report to each plan participant; and
                                           ■ any terminal report to the IRS.

                                19.1 INTRODUCTION
                                    Unlike health insurance, which is more or less mandatory in many parts of the country, dental
                                    insurance is still considered an optional insurance. However, just like the ever-increasing cost of
                                    medical care, dental costs are increasing as well. Dental insurance generally covers a percentage of costs
                                    for basic and major services.

                                    This unit covers the various types of treatments and features of dental insurance and provides an
                                    overview of group dental coverage.

        19.3 DENTAL EXPENSE PLANS

                   19.3.1 Types of Dental Treatment
                   Dental expense plans usually provide coverage for the following types of dental treatment:

                           ■ diagnostic and preventive—routine exams and x-rays, regular cleanings, fluoride treatments;
                           ■ restorative—repairing or restoring teeth that have been damaged, usually by tooth decay; fillings
                             and crowns are restorative treatments;
                           ■ oral surgery—surgery performed in the oral cavity, for example, the removal of wisdom teeth;
                           ■ endodontics—treatment of the pulp (the soft tissue substance located in the center of each tooth);
                             root canals are an endodontic treatment;
                           ■ periodontics—treatment of the supporting structures of the teeth – that is, the gums;
                           ■ prosthodontics—artificial replacements, such as bridges and dental implants; and
                           ■ orthodontics—correction of irregular alignment of the teeth; most commonly, braces.

                              19.3.2 Coverage Features
                              19.3.2.1 Choice of Provider
                              Dental expense coverage may be offered under a traditional indemnity plan which places no limits
                              on the insured’s choice of dentist. Many dental expense plans are offered through preferred provider
                              organizations (PPOs) which have contracted with particular dentists to provide services for pre-
                              arranged fees. In order to get the highest reimbursement rates (80% to 100%) on the treatment the
                              insured must choose a dentist that belongs to the PPO network. The insured may go outside the
                              network, but reimbursement rates will be much lower (50% to 60%).

                              19.3.2.2 Scheduled vs. Nonscheduled Plans
                              Some dental expense plans are scheduled; benefits are limited to a specified maximum per procedure,
                              with first dollar coverage, much like basic hospital, medical, and surgical plans. Most, however, are
                              nonscheduled plans that pay on a usual, customary, and reasonable (UCR) basis like comprehensive
                              medical expense coverage.

                              19.3.2.3 Combination Plans
                              Some dental expense plans combine features of both the scheduled (basic) and nonscheduled
                              (comprehensive) plans. They typically cover diagnostic and preventive treatment on a usual, customary,
                              and reasonable basis but use a fee schedule for other dental services.

                              19.3.2.4 Deductibles, Coinsurance, and Limits for Various Benefit Categories
                              Deductibles, coinsurance, and limits often apply differently to various levels of treatment.

                                   ■ Diagnostic/preventive services are usually covered without deductibles or coinsurance to encourage
                                     preventive dental care. However, routine exams and cleanings are generally limited to twice a year
                                     and diagnostic x-rays to once every two or three years.
                                   ■ Basic services such as fillings, crowns, and local anesthesia may be subject to a deductible and 20%
                                     coinsurance or a limit per service in excess of which the insured must pay. There may also be an
                                     overall annual limit on benefits for all basic services.
                                   ■ Major services such as oral surgery, root canals, periodontics, bridges, and implants may be
                                     subject to a higher coinsurance rate, such as 50%, as well as per-service limits. Replacement
                                     of dentures may be limited to once every five years. Orthodontia usually has its own separate
                                     deductible, higher coinsurance rate, and annual limit.

                              19.3.2.5 Predetermination of Benefits
                              Most dental expense plans recommend, and a few require, that dentists provide patients with a written
                              treatment plan showing the estimated charge for each service to be performed, along with a breakdown
                              of how much of the cost is expected to be paid by the dental plan, and how much will remain for the
                              insured to pay. Often the recommendation or requirement applies only to treatment that will exceed
                              a certain amount, such as $200 or $300. These plans allow the insurer to predetermine and advise the
                              insured of the amount of coverage the plan will provide for the proposed care. This helps the insured
                              evaluate their treatment options and budget for their upcoming treatment.

                                19.3.3.1 Integrated Deductible vs. Stand-Alone Plan
                                In regard to employer group coverage, dental expense coverage may be integrated within a
                                comprehensive health plan or provided as a stand-alone supplement along with a health plan. When
                                integrated into a comprehensive health plan, the dental expense coverage will not have a separate
                                deductible – only the health plan deductible needs to be satisfied. More often, dental expense coverage
                                is offered as a stand-alone supplement with its own deductible and coinsurance requirements.

                   19.3.3.2 Minimizing Adverse Selection
                   Dental expense coverage differs from medical coverage in significant ways.

                           ■ Patients’ choices in treatment options often represent a big difference in costs. For instance, a
                             patient can choose bridgework that is fixed or removable and inlays that are made of gold or a less
                             expensive but equally durable material.
                           ■ Needed dental work can often be postponed longer than necessary medical treatment. Employees
                             who need dental work may be able to wait until a dental expense plan becomes effective, causing
                             the insurer to be liable for larger benefits than it would otherwise expect to pay.
                   Insurers often implement the following restrictions to minimize the increased potential for adverse
                   selection in dental expense plans.

                           ■ Probationary periods (a period of time after the employee becomes eligible to join the group plan
                             before dental expense coverage is effective).
                           ■ Limitations on benefits for late enrollees (those that want to sign up for coverage after the end of
                             the 30-day enrollment period that follows the eligibility period).
                           ■ Reduced benefit limits during the first year of coverage.
                           ■ No conversion privilege to convert the dental expense coverage to an individual plan if the group
                             coverage terminates (however, dental expense coverage is subject to COBRA continuation rules).

                              20.1 INTRODUCTION
                                  Medicare and Medicaid are two government insurance programs that pay medical and health-related
                                  services to specific groups of people. Although the two programs are very different, they are both
                                  managed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a division of the U.S. Department of
                                  Health and Human Services.

                                  When an individual turns age 65 and has obtained fully insured status with Social Security, Medicare
                                  becomes either their primary or secondary health insurance plan.

                                  Medicaid, on the other hand, is not an entitlement. It’s a means-tested health and medical services

        20.3 MEDICARE

                   20.3.1 Nature, Financing, and Administration
                   Medicare pays a large portion of the health care bill for persons who:

                          ■ are age 65 or over;
                          ■ have end-stage renal disease (kidney failure); or
                          ■ have been receiving Social Security disability benefits for at least 24 months.
                   In order to be covered by Medicare, an individual must be “fully insured” according to Social Security.
                   Qualification requires accumulating at least 40 credits, which are earned by generating a minimum
                   amount of work-related income over at least the past 10 years and paying Social Security (FICA) taxes.

                   Medicare is federally funded by The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which is
                   a branch of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Private healthcare insurance
                   companies process medical claims for Medicare and are known as Medicare Administrative
                   Contractors (MAC).

                   The initial enrollment for Medicare is a seven-month period that begins three months before the month
                   an individual turns 65, includes the month they turn 65, and ends three months after the month they
                   turn 65.

                                Medicare coverage is divided into four parts.

                                      ■ Part A covers hospital, skilled nursing facility, hospice, and home health care.
                                      ■ Part B covers medical care provided by physicians and other medical services.
                                      ■ Part C covers health care delivered by managed care plans.
                                      ■ Part D covers prescription drugs,

                   20.3.2.2 Inpatient Hospital Coverage
                   Medicare Part A’s inpatient hospital coverage is for a semi-private room and the other usual charges
                   for necessary hospital care: meals, supplies, medical services, drugs taken as an inpatient, and so on.

                   It does not cover:

                           ■ physician or surgeon charges;
                           ■ private duty nursing;
                           ■ the first three pints of blood (the blood deductible—this is the total combined deductible that
                             must be met, including any blood received under Part B); or
                           ■ charges for a phone, a TV, or other non-medical services.
                   Part A inpatient hospital coverage is based on benefit periods rather than the calendar year. A benefit
                   period begins when someone is admitted to the hospital and ends 60 days after discharge. If the person
                   is re-admitted within 60 days of discharge, it does not start a new benefit period but is a continuation of
                   the initial one.

                   For each benefit period, inpatient hospital coverage and cost-sharing amounts are as follows:

                           ■ the patient pays a deductible, which changes annually (but remember that the deductible applies
                             per benefit period, not per calendar year);
                           ■ days 1 through 60—fully paid by Medicare (after the deductible); and
                           ■ days 61 through 90—Medicare pays most of the cost, and the patient pays a daily co-pay amount
                             which changes each year.
                   For a stay over 90 days, the patient may draw upon 60 lifetime reserve days. The daily co-pay for
                   lifetime reserve days is double that of days 61 through 90. This co-pay amount also changes each year.

                                                                                         Hospital

                   20.3.2.3 Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) Care
                   A skilled nursing facility (SNF) is for people that need round-the-clock medical care provided by
                   licensed nurses, but does not need the acute care provided by a hospital. A facility that provides only
                   intermediate (less than round-the-clock) medical care or custodial care (help with the activities of daily
                   living—ADLs—such as eating, bathing, and so on) is not a skilled nursing facility. Intermediate Care
                   and Custodial Care are not covered by Medicare.

                                Medicare covers skilled nursing facility care if:

                                       ■ it is a Medicare-approved facility; and
                                       ■ the SNF stay begins immediately after release from a hospital stay of at least three days.
                                If those conditions are met, Medicare coverage and cost-sharing amounts for a skilled nursing facility
                                stay are as follows:

                                       ■ day 1 through 20—fully paid by Medicare; and
                                       ■ days 21 through 100 —Medicare pays most of the cost and the patient pays a daily co-pay amount
                                         which changes each year.
                                After day 100, Medicare pays nothing.

                   20.3.2.5 Hospice Care
                   Hospice care is for terminally ill patients and their families. It includes counseling, pain relief, and
                   symptom management.

                   It may also include respite care, which is care provided temporarily in a hospice facility for a patient
                   who is normally cared for in the home. The respite is for the usual caregivers.

                              20.3.3.1 Enrollment
                              Individuals who enroll in Part A are automatically enrolled in Part B unless they request otherwise.
                              Part B is optional and requires a monthly Part B premium. The Part B monthly premium is tied to an
                              individual’s income level and is deducted from the Social Security monthly benefit check.

                              If Part B enrollment occurs before the month an individual reaches age 65, coverage begins on the first
                              day of that month (same as Part A coverage). If an individual initially declines Part B enrollment, they
                              can enroll during the general enrollment period that occurs each year from January 1 through March 31
                              and coverage starts at the beginning of the following month.

                              20.3.4 Claims Process
                              Medicare determines what the reasonable charge is for a particular service, and the patient must pay
                              the difference if the actual charge is more, unless the doctor or supplier agrees to accept assignment.
                              This means that the doctor or supplier will accept Medicare’s approved amounts as full payment and
                              cannot legally bill the patient for anything above that amount. Doctors and suppliers are not required to
                              accept assignment.

                              If Medicare decides that an expense is medically unnecessary, the patient must pay the entire cost.

                              If a doctor has not accepted a Medicare assignment, the bill is sent directly to the patient. They must fill
                              out a Medicare claim form with the itemized bills including the date and place of treatment, description
                              of treatment, and the doctor’s name. The form and accompanying documents are sent to the Medicare
                              carrier for the patient’s area. Upon receiving the claim, the carrier sends the patient a form called
                              Explanation of Medicare Benefits that itemizes the services covered and the approved payment for each
                              service.

                              20.3.5 Exclusions
                              Medicare Part B does not cover:

                                In the 1990s, a new option, Medicare Part C – called Medicare Advantage – was enacted. Private
                                companies contract with Medicare to provide Medicare beneficiaries with their Part A and Part B
                                coverage, and some additional benefits, for usually an additional cost. Many Medicare Advantage plans
                                include prescription drug coverage.

                                Medicare beneficiaries can choose to receive their benefits from a Medicare Advantage plan but they
                                still must enroll in Part A and B, pay the Part B premium, and pay the Medicare Advantage plan
                                premium.

                                20.3.6.2 Types of Medicare Advantage Plans
                                There are four types of Medicare Advantage plans.

                                      ■ Medicare managed care plans—these operate like health maintenance organization (HMO)
                                        or point-of-service (POS) plans. Care must be obtained from the plan’s network of providers
                                        under the direction of a primary care physician who acts as a gatekeeper. Enrollees may have to
                                        pay a small co-payment per doctor visit, but they do not have to pay Medicare deductibles and
                                        coinsurance amounts. These plans often cover services not covered by original Medicare, such as
                                        routine physical exams, prescription drugs, vision care, and dental care.
                                      ■ Medicare preferred provider organization (PPO) plans—these plans have a network of
                                        providers, but no gatekeeper. Enrollees pay more of their costs if they go outside the plan’s
                                        network.
                                      ■ Medicare private fee-for-service (PFFS) plans—these plans operate on a fee-for-service basis
                                        like original Medicare, but rather than using the fees established by Medicare, a private company
                                        negotiates the fees that providers will be paid.
                                      ■ Medicare specialty plans—these plans focus on the particular needs of defined groups of
                                        patients, such as those who are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, or those with a certain
                                        medical condition like kidney failure or diabetes.

                   20.3.7 Medicare Part D: Prescription Drug Coverage
                   Medicare Part D makes prescription drug coverage available to people covered by Medicare.
                   Individuals with Part A and B can obtain this coverage by signing up with a stand-alone prescription
                   drug plan (PDP) and beneficiaries pay the following cost:

                           ■ a monthly premium—high-income beneficiaries may pay a relatively higher premium;
                           ■ an annual deductible with a maximum amount—not all PDPs have a deductible, or charge the
                             maximum deductible; and
                           ■ 25% coinsurance—until total expenditures reach the threshold amount for the coverage gap.
                   When Medicare Part D started, there was a coverage gap commonly referred to as the donut hole. In
                   this gap, the insured paid 100% of the cost of prescription drugs. Under the PPACA of 2010, the donut
                   hole coverage gap was gradually reduced through a combination of measures, including brand-name
                   and generic drug discounts and a gradual decrease in the catastrophic coverage threshold.

                   Beginning in 2020, once the insured reaches the coverage gap, they will pay no more than 25% of the
                   cost for the plan’s covered brand-name prescription drugs and generic prescription drugs. Again, prior
                   to the Affordable Care Act, the insured paid 100% of the cost in the coverage gap.

                                20.3.8 Medicare and Employer Group Health Coverage
                                An individual age 65 or over may be covered by a group health plan and Medicare. Which plan is
                                primary depends on the size of the employer and whether the individual is still an employee or is
                                retired. If the employer has less than 20 employees, Medicare is primary. If the employer has 20 or more
                                employees and the individual is still an employee, the group health plan is primary and Medicare is
                                secondary. If the employer has 20 or more employees and the individual is retired, Medicare is primary
                                and the group plan is secondary. Regardless of employer size, a Medicare-eligible person could choose
                                to reject the group health coverage, in which case Medicare becomes the primary payer for Medicare-
                                covered health services.

                                For individuals under age 65 and on Medicare because of a disability or end-stage renal disease,
                                the employer plan will be primary if it is a large group health plan covering at least 100 employees.
                                Medicare would be primary if the group is not a large group health plan.

        20.4 MEDICARE SUPPLEMENT INSURANCE
                   A Medicare supplement insurance (Medigap) policy, sold by private companies, can help pay some of
                   health care cost that Original Medicare doesn’t cover, like co-payments, coinsurance, and deductibles.
                   A Medicare supplement policy is designed to fill the “gaps” in original Medicare and Parts A and B. It is
                   illegal for anyone to sell a Medicare supplement policy to a person who is in a Medicare Advantage plan
                   (Medicare Part C).

                   20.4.1 Standard Plans
                   Medicare supplements have been standardized by the National Association of Insurance
                   Commissioners (NAIC) and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) into 10 different plans,
                   labeled A through N and sold by private companies. Each plan offers a different combination of benefits
                   and the premium cost is proportional to the coverage provided.

                   The rules governing the sale and offerings of Medigap policies vary from state to state. Some states
                   such as Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Wisconsin require Medicare supplements to provide additional
                   coverage than what is defined in the standardized plans.

                   This section has a table that shows the benefits provided by each of the 10 standard Medigap plans.
                   Certain standard plans have been dropped and others added over the years, so letters do not run
                   consecutively.

                           ■ All standard Medigap plans must include certain basic, or core, benefits:
                                         – 100% of the Part A hospital coinsurance plus the full cost of 365 additional days after all Part
                                           A hospital benefits are exhausted;
                                         – Part B coinsurance or co-payment after the annual deductible is met—100% for all plans
                                           except K (50%) and L (75%); and
                                         – the cost of the first three pints of blood each year—100% for all plans except K (50%) and L
                                           (75%).
                           ■ Plan A covers only the basic benefits. Insurers do not have to offer every Medigap plan, but if they
                             offer any, they must offer Plan A.

                                                ■ All the other Medigap plans include various combinations of other benefits in addition to the
                                                  basic benefits.
                                                ■ Plans K and L offer some unique benefits compared to the other plans – they also have lower
                                                  premiums than those plans. But plans K and L require higher out-of-pocket costs because these
                                                  plans were designed to give beneficiaries an incentive to control costs. Plans K and L are similar,
                                                  but differ in the percentage of coverage for claims and in the maximum amount of out-of-pocket
                                                  costs.

                                  Plans F and G also have a high-deductible option, which requires first paying a plan deductible before the plan begins to pay. Once the
                                  plan deductible is met, the plan pays 100% of covered services for the rest of the calendar year. High-deductible Plan G does not cover
                                  the Medicare Part B deductible. However, high-deductible Plans F and G count payment of the Medicare Part B deductible toward
                                  meeting the plan deductible.
                                ** After meeting the out-of-pocket yearly limit and the yearly Part B deductible, the Medigap plan pays 100% of covered services for the

                                    for emergency room visits that don’t result in inpatient admission.

                                    A buyer’s guide, such as the one developed by the NAIC entitled A Guide to Health Insurance for
                                    People with Medicare, must be given to all applicants for a Medicare Supplement policy at the time of
                                    application or the upon delivery of the policy.

                                    Applicants must also be given an Outline of Coverage that describes the policy’s principal coverage and
                                    benefits, premium, renewal provisions.

                                    The first page of the policy must contain:

                                         ■ the words Notice to Buyer—this policy may not cover all of your medical expenses;
                                         ■ prominent notice of the 30-day free look period; and
                                         ■ the policy’s renewal provision including a description of any premium increases that may be
                                           involved.

                                    20.5.2 Sales and Marketing
                                    During the open enrollment period, insurers must guarantee issue the Medigap policy if the applicant is
                                    both 65 or older and has enrolled in Medicare Part B within the last six months. Pre-existing conditions
                                    can be excluded for the first six months of coverage but only if the condition was treated in the six
                                    months immediately preceding the effective date of the policy.

                                    Producers must determine the suitability for a Medigap policy sale and if the plan is appropriate for the
                                    circumstances and discover if the applicant already owns a policy.

                                    Producers may not engage is twisting, high-pressure tactics, cold lead advertising (not disclosing that
                                    the purpose is to solicit insurance), or any other deceptive sales practice.

                                    First year sales compensation—including bonuses, gifts, awards, or finder’s fees—may not exceed 200%
                                    of compensation paid for the second year’s renewal. Renewal compensation must be level for years two
                                    through five.

                                    First year compensation may not exceed the amount of renewal compensation when a replacement
                                    policy is sold.

                                    If a group Medigap policy is replaced, the new policy must cover everyone that was covered under
                                    the old policy, and no pre-existing condition limitations may be imposed that would not have applied
                                    under the old policy.

                                    If a group Medigap policy is terminated, all group members must be offered individual coverage.

                                    If an individual leaves the group Medicare plan and continuation of benefits is not available, they must
                                    be offered individual coverage.

                                    20.5.3 Required Provisions
                                    Medigap policies must be at least guaranteed renewable.

                   Medicare SELECT is coverage offered through a restricted provider network, like a managed care
                   plan. Insurers may not sell Medicare SELECT policies to individuals outside the network service area.

                                    Medicaid is a government insurance program for persons of all ages whose income and resources are
                                    insufficient to pay for health care. It is a means-tested program that is jointly funded by the state and
                                    federal government, managed by the state, and the state establishes eligibility guidelines.

                                    Medicaid recipients must be U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents, and may include low-income
                                    adults, their children, and people with certain disabilities. Poverty alone does not necessarily qualify
                                    someone for Medicaid.

                                    To receive Medicaid, a person must qualify for either:

                                           ■ Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF—generally called welfare); or
                                           ■ Supplemental Security Income (SSI), assistance program for people living at or near the poverty
                                             line who are age 65 or over, blind, or disabled.
                                    For those who qualify, Medicaid covers most health care costs, including hospital and doctor bills
                                    and custodial care in a nursing home. Medicaid is also required by law to pay Medicare premiums,
                                    deductibles, and coinsurance for Medicare-eligible Medicaid patients.

                                21.1 INTRODUCTION
                                    Long-term care insurance is usually purchased as a means to pay for some or all of the services that can
                                    stem from a long or chronic illness, disability, or cognitive impairment like Alzheimer’s disease. Often,
                                    the services that are most needed are those that assist with the Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) which
                                    include bathing, dressing, eating, transferring, using the toilet, and caring for incontinence.

                                    Long-term care and health care focus on sometimes overlapping issues: health care provides ways to
                                    improve a person’s health, while long-term care provides services based on the condition as it stands
                                    currently. While the average life span has increased to 84 years, so have the costs for nursing homes,
                                    assisted living, skilled care, and other care associated with the aging process. Assisted living facilities
                                    can range from the mid-five figures, at a minimum, to hundreds of thousands of dollars annually,
                                    depending on the type of facility and care needed. Premiums for long-term care insurance can be
                                    expensive. They are based on the applicant’s age, health, and the level of benefits, coverage, and options
                                    chosen.

                                    In this unit, you will learn about the structure of the long-term care policy, how and why it is carefully
                                    regulated and monitored, and the protection it provides for millions of senior citizens.

        21.3 MEDICARE, MEDICAID, AND LONG-TERM CARE

                   21.3.1 Medicare’s Long-Term Care Coverage
                   One of the largest costs involved in long-term care services is custodial care, which includes assistance
                   with personal care or supervision. Medicare does not pay for these costs except under specific
                   circumstances.

                   Medicare assistance is available for short-term stays in a skilled nursing facility, for hospice care, and
                   for home health care as long as the insured has recently been in the hospital at least three days and
                   has been admitted to a Medicare-certified nursing facility within 30 days after the hospital and skilled
                   nursing, physical therapy, or other skilled care is needed.

                   As discussed in a previous unit, costs for skilled care in a nursing home are covered for up to 100
                   days. The first 20 days are covered 100% by Medicare. However, the insured is responsible for a daily
                   co-payment for days 21 through 100, and there is no Medicare coverage after 100 days. Hospice care,
                   other than grief counseling, is covered if the insured has a terminal illness and is not expected to live
                   more than six months.

                   Medicare also provides some home and other care services as long as they are medically necessary to
                   treat an injury or illness. As long as a doctor, every 60 days, determines this care is medically necessary,
                   there is no time limit on how long the care may be received.

                   Medicare supplement insurance plans also do not cover long-term care needs such as custodial care,
                   adult day care, care for those with Alzheimer’s disease, or assisted living.

                              21.3.2 Medicaid’s Long-Term Care Coverage
                              Medicaid covers the type of long-term care most people need, but only if they are impoverished.
                              This is in keeping with Medicaid’s purpose of providing a safety net for the poor. Many of the elderly
                              Americans whose long-term care costs are paid by Medicaid did not start out poor. They spent
                              themselves into poverty paying for their own long-term care. Once they are on Medicaid, all of their
                              income except for a small monthly allowance must go to help pay for their care. After a Medicaid
                              beneficiary dies, Medicaid has the right to recover the amount of benefits it paid on that person’s behalf
                              from assets in the deceased beneficiary’s estate.

                              With a long-term care policy individuals can plan for their future needs. They can select the long-term
                              care they will receive by choosing the amount and type of policy benefits; they can maintain financial
                              independence and preserve assets for their heirs.

                     21.4.1 Activities of Daily Living (ADLs)
                     Activities of daily living (ADLs) are used as measurements to determine someone’s ability to live
                     independently. The ADLs have been standardized and are listed from the least to the most impaired
                     person:

                              ■ bathing—in a tub, shower, or by sponge bath;
                              ■ dressing;
                              ■ toileting;
                              ■ transferring—getting out of bed and into a chair, moving about the house;
                              ■ continence—bladder and bowel control; and
                              ■ eating.
                     Insureds become eligible for benefits under a long-term care insurance policy if they are unable to
                     perform some number of the ADLs by themselves. Generally, the number is two, but policies can vary.

                                    21.4.2 Cognitive Impairment
                                    An individual may be eligible for long-term care insurance benefits if they are cognitively impaired.
                                    Tests administered by medical practitioners or social workers can measure an individual’s ability to
                                    perceive, reason, or remember. Benefits are triggered when the cognitive impairment requires someone
                                    to be supervised for their own safety or the safety of others.

                                21.5 LEVELS OF CARE
                                    There are three levels of long-term care and they vary depending on the intensity of the services provided.

                                           ■ Skilled nursing care (24/7) is provided on a round-the-clock basis and can be performed only by
                                             licensed nurses under a doctor’s orders.
                                           ■ Intermediate care (only 7) is intermittent (less than round-the-clock) care performed by licensed
                                             nurses nursing under a doctor’s orders.
                                           ■ Custodial care is help in performing ADLs and can be performed by someone without medical
                                             training.

                   Types of care are defined in long-term care insurance policies.

                           ■ Home health care refers to skilled medical and therapy services performed in the individual’s
                             home by visiting home health aides.
                           ■ Adult day care provides company, supervision, along with social and recreational support for
                             people whose grown children care for them at home but need to work during the day.
                           ■ Respite care is similar to that provided in connection with hospice care; professionals care for
                             someone temporarily in order to give a few days rest to the family member or friend who usually
                             provides the care.
                           ■ Assisted living facilities are for people who need assistance from time to time, but can live more
                             independently than people who need custodial care. Assisted living facilities provide housing,
                             meals, and help with personal care; some offer more extensive services such as social programs
                             and medical care.

                                    Long-term care insurance policies provide coverage for at least 12 months. Most policies allow
                                    applicants to choose among benefit periods of from two to five years; the longer the benefit period,
                                    the higher the premium. Some policies offer lifetime benefit periods with a lifetime maximum benefit
                                    amount. The benefit period would end when the limit has been reached.

                                    that is close to the average daily cost of facility-based care in their area. Naturally, higher daily benefits

                   policy will pay regardless of the actual cost of care. Long-term care coverage can also be issued on a
                   reimbursement basis, which pays the lesser of the cost of care or the daily benefit.

                   If the policy is comprehensive—that is, it provides coverage for both facility-based and home-based care – the
                   home care amount is usually stated as 50% of the daily facility-based care benefit.

                   21.6.3 Elimination Period
                   Similar to disability income policies, long-term care insurance policies usually contain an elimination
                   period. The insured must receive care for a stated number of days before the policy begins to pay.

                   Insureds may select a longer elimination period to make a policy more affordable – the longer the
                   elimination period, the lower the premium.

                                    income taxation of long-term care insurance policies and spells out the requirements that must be met
                                    in order for a policy to be considered “Qualified.”

                                         ■ Must be unable to perform two out of six ADLs
                                         ■ Must be certified by a health professional as having a chronic illness that will last for a minimum

                                           actually apply to all long-term care insurance policies and are covered later in this unit)
                                    Benefits are received income-tax free up to a specified amount that is indexed for inflation (for
                                    indemnity policies) or the actual amount of expenses incurred (for reimbursement policies).

                                    Premiums paid by self-employed people are tax-deductible up to an age-based limit that is indexed
                                    for inflation. Individuals, other than the self-employed, may include their long-term care insurance
                                    premiums, up to the age-based limit, in their itemized medical expenses which are deductible to the
                                    extent they exceed a certain percentage of the person’s gross income.

                                    Employers who pay long-term care insurance premiums on behalf of employees may deduct them as a
                                    business expense. Employer-paid premiums are not taxable income to the employees.

                                    HIPAA does not prohibit the sale of nonqualified long-term care insurance policies. In fact, since
                                    nonqualified policies do not have to meet HIPAA’s requirements, they may offer benefits that are more
                                    attractive than qualified policies. But nonqualified policies do not receive favorable tax treatment.
                                    Premiums are not deductible and benefits are taxable as income.

        21.9 STATE LONG-TERM CARE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS
                   Many middle-class families have too much money to qualify for Medicaid but can’t afford to self-insure
                   the potential catastrophic costs of long-term care. In an effort to encourage more people to purchase
                   long-term care insurance, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) created the Qualified State Long
                   Term Care Partnership program.

                   State long-term care insurance partnership programs are a joint effort of:

                           ■ commercial insurers, who develop, market, and issue the policies and pay their benefits;
                           ■ a state’s insurance department, which regulates the companies and producers who sell the
                             policies; and
                           ■ the state Medicaid agency that provides the policy with unique asset protection features.
                   A partnership program works this way: An individual purchases a LTCI partnership policy meeting
                   the requirements for that state. If benefits are needed the LTCI policy will pay and the state Medicaid

                                  program does not have to cover the cost. If the policy benefits are exhausted due to a long time need for
                                  care and the insured needs to apply to Medicaid, they are not obligated to spend down all their assets
                                  to qualify. Under what is called the dollar-for-dollar approach, this person may keep assets equal in
                                  amount of the benefits received under the partnership policy and the assets are exempt from Medicaid
                                  estate recovery and so are preserved for their heirs.

                              21.10 INDIVIDUAL VS. GROUP LTC CONTRACTS
                                  The advantages and disadvantages of individual versus group long-term care insurance are the same
                                  as those for individual versus group insurance generally. Group insurance offers lower rates and
                                  people can get coverage without providing evidence of insurability. Group insurance plans however,
                                  are not tailored to meet individual needs because the employer chooses the plan coverage for all the
                                  participants.


                              21.11 UNDERWRITING CONSIDERATIONS
                                  Underwriting factors for long-term care insurance differ from those used for other health insurance
                                  policies. For example, people with heart disease or diabetes would be rated as substandard risks under
                                  a disability insurance policy. But because long-term care insurance policies cover chronic health
                                  conditions, a different underwriting classification would be used for this condition.

                                  The main issue for long-term care policies is whether an individual can perform the activities of daily
                                  living (ADLs) and to what degree of proficiency. If heart disease condition does not interfere with
                                  one’s ability to perform the ADLs, they would be rated as a standard risk for a long-term care policy.
                                  Conversely, a person in otherwise great health who walks with the use of a cane may not be eligible for
                                  long-term care insurance.

        21.12 REGULATION

                   21.12.1              Marketing Standards
                   Marketing standards for long-term care insurance are basically the same as those for Medicare
                   supplement insurance:

                          ■ provide applicants with a shopper’s guide and outline of coverage;
                          ■ consider whether the purchase is suitable for the applicant’s needs, objectives, and circumstances;
                          ■ determine whether the sale will involve replacement, and if so, have the applicant sign a Notice
                            Regarding Replacement;
                          ■ provide a 30-day free-look period;
                          ■ assure that advertising is not misleading; and
                          ■ describe the policy’s renewal conditions on its first page.(Guaranteed Renewable).

                   21.12.2              Minimum Benefit Standards
                   A long-term care insurance policy’s provisions must meet the following requirements:

                          ■ the policy must be at least guaranteed renewable- the only way the policy can be cancelled is for
                            nonpayments of premium, insurer can raise premium for all those who have the same policy;
                          ■ a sale must include an offer of inflation protection (option to raise the limits of coverage due to
                            inflation);
                          ■ a pre-existing condition may not be defined more restrictively than a condition for which medical
                            advice or treatment was sought within six months before the policy’s effective date;
                          ■ long-term care policies cannot condition payment of benefit on a prior hospital stay;
                          ■ group long-term care insurance policies must give insureds the opportunity to continue benefits
                            if membership in the group ceases or to convert to individual coverage if coverage terminates;
                            and

                                    an E-Z file tax return can they deduct out-of-pocket medical bills?

                                    Although insurance agents are not CPA’s, they do need to know basic taxation issues regarding health
                                    insurance plans and premiums and that is the focus of this unit.

                                22.4 MEDICAL EXPENSE COVERAGE FOR SOLE PROPRIETORS AND
                                     PARTNERSHIPS
                                    Self-employed persons are allowed to deduct 100% of what they pay for health insurance (including
                                    qualified long-term care insurance) from their gross income. To claim this deduction, however , the
                                    self-employed:

                                           ■ must show a net profit for the year; and
                                           ■ cannot claim the deduction for any month in which they were eligible to participate in a health
                                             plan subsidized by another employer, if they are also self-employed, or by the employer of their
                                             spouse.
                                    Premiums paid by a partnership on an accident and health insurance policy are generally deductible
                                    by the partnership. The amount of the premium is included in the partner’s gross income, and is
                                    deductible on the same basis as for self-employed persons.

                                    Benefits are considered a reimbursement of expenses and are not taxable.

                                                                                                         Medical Expense Policies for Self

                                           ■ buy-sell,
                                           ■ key person, and
                                           ■ business overhead expense (BOE).

        22.6 HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS
                   A Health Savings Account (HSA) is a tax-advantaged medical savings account available to taxpayers
                   enrolled in a high-deductible health plan (HDHP):

                           ■ contributions to an HSA are tax-deductible;
                           ■ earnings in the HSA grow tax-deferred; and
                           ■ HSA distributions are tax-free when used to pay qualified medical expenses.
                   Individuals do not need IRS authorization the set up an HSA. They can establish an account with a
                   bank, insurance company, or investment company which will act as a trustee, similar to an individual
                   retirement account (IRA). Unlike a Flexible Spending Account (FSA), funds roll over and accumulate
                   year to year if not spent. Distributions for other than qualified medical expenses are subject to income
                   tax; a 20% penalty tax also applies unless the account beneficiary has died, become disabled, or is age
                   65 or older.

                   22.6.1 Eligibility
                   Individuals are eligible to establish an HSA if they:

                           ■ have no other comprehensive medical expense coverage, including Medicare (they can have a
                             limited benefit plan, disability income, or long-term care insurance);
                           ■ cannot be claimed as a dependent on another person’s tax return; and
                           ■ are enrolled in a High-Deductible Health Plan (HDHP).


                                                                                        Heath Savings Accounts

                                    22.6.2 High Deductible Health Plans (HDHPs)
                                    A high deductible health plan (HDHP) is a health plan that offers lower premiums and requires the
                                    insured to pay a high deductible when the plan is used. The amount of the deductible required changes
                                    yearly.

                                22.7 HEALTH REIMBURSEMENT ACCOUNTS
                                    Some employers provide employees with health plans with relatively high deductibles and create a tax-
                                    favored Health Reimbursement Account (HRA) for each covered employee. Unlike the HSA, a high-
                                    deductible health plan (HDHP) is not required in order for the employer to establish an HRA. Similar to
                                    the HSA, the employee can obtain reimbursement from the HRA for medical expenses that are subject to
                                    deductibles, coinsurance, and co-payments. HRA contributions are pretax and made only by the employer.
                                    The employer may restrict the use of the funds in an HRA, and the funds roll over year to year.

        22.8 FLEXIBLE SPENDING ARRANGEMENTS
                   A Flexible Spending Arrangement (FSA) is a cafeteria plan benefit that is funded with employee
                   money by means of a salary reduction. Employee contributions are made on a pre-tax basis, and as a
                   qualified employee benefit plan, employee benefits are non-taxable. Working spouses are also covered
                   by the employee’s benefit plan and choices can be made to avoid duplicating benefits provided by their
                   spouse’s plan.

                   From the employer’s perspective:

                           ■ the plan is funded with employee contributions, so the employer’s expenses are limited to
                             administrative costs; and
                           ■ the salary reduction method results in a reduced payroll and therefore reduced payroll taxes for
                             the employer.


                                                                                       Flexible Spending Arrangement—
