## 🤖 AUTOMATION OPPORTUNITIES

### Email Parsing
```python
# Pseudo-code for automated regulatory update detection

import email
import re
from datetime import datetime

def parse_regulatory_email(email_content):
    """
    Automatically extract key information from regulatory emails
    """
    
    # Extract source
    if "FINRA" in email_content:
        source = "FINRA"
    elif "SEC" in email_content:
        source = "SEC"
    # ... other sources
    
    # Extract rule number
    rule_pattern = r"Rule \d{4}|Regulatory Notice \d{2}-\d{2}|Release No\. \d+-\d+"
    rule_number = re.findall(rule_pattern, email_content)[0]
    
    # Extract effective date
    date_pattern = r"effective (?:on |)([A-Z][a-z]+ \d{1,2}, \d{4})"
    effective_date = re.findall(date_pattern, email_content)[0]
    
    # Create tracker entry
    return {
        "update_id": f"RU-{datetime.now().year}-{next_id}",
        "source": source,
        "rule_number": rule_number,
        "effective_date": effective_date,
        "status": "New - Needs Assessment"
    }

# Integration: Email filter → Parse → Add to tracker → Notify CCO
```

### Calendar Integration
```python
# Automatically create calendar reminders for deadlines

def create_implementation_reminders(update_id, deadline_date):
    """
    Creates calendar reminders at key intervals before deadline
    """
    
    reminders = [
        {"days_before": 90, "message": "90 days to implementation"},
        {"days_before": 60, "message": "60 days to implementation"},
        {"days_before": 30, "message": "30 days to implementation"},
        {"days_before": 14, "message": "2 weeks to implementation - URGENT"},
        {"days_before": 7, "message": "1 week to implementation - CRITICAL"}
    ]
    
    for reminder in reminders:
        # Calculate reminder date
        reminder_date = deadline_date - timedelta(days=reminder["days_before"])
        
        # Create calendar event
        create_calendar_event(
            title=f"Regulatory Update {update_id} - {reminder['message']}",
            date=reminder_date,
            attendees=["CCO", "Compliance Team"],
            priority="HIGH" if reminder["days_before"] <= 14 else "MEDIUM"
        )
```

### Dashboard Visualization
