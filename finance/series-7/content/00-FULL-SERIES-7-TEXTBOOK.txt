           INTRODUCTION
           INTRODUCTION
                     Thank you for choosing Kaplan for your educational needs and welcome to the General
                     Securities Representative Examination (Top-Off) Series 7 License Exam Manual (LEM). This
                     manual applies adult learning principles to give you the tools you’ll need to pass your exam on
                     the first attempt.


                     Why Do I Need to Pass the Series 7 Exam?
                     The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), or another self-regulatory
                     organization, requires its members and employees of its members to pass a qualification exam
                     to become registered as a general securities representative. You must pass the Series 7 exam to
                     be qualified to sell all types of securities.


                     Are There Any Prerequisites?
                     No. However, in order for a Series 7 registration to become effective, an individual must pass
                     both the Series 7 qualification exam and the Securities Industry Essentials (SIE) exam.


                     What Is the Series 7 Exam Like?
                     The exam is administered via computer. A tutorial on how to take the exam is provided
                     prior to taking the exam. Each candidate’s exam includes 10 additional, unidentified pretest
                     items that do not contribute toward the candidate’s score. The pretest items are randomly
                     distributed throughout the exam. Each candidate’s exam consists of a total of 135 items
                     (125 scored and 10 unscored). There is no penalty for guessing. Therefore, candidates should
                     attempt to answer all items. Candidates will be allowed three hours and 45 minutes to
                     complete the Series 7 exam.


                     What Score Must I Achieve to Pass?
                     You need a score of at least 72% on the Series 7 exam to pass and become eligible for
                     registration as a general securities representative. Be sure to check the Exam Tips and Content
                     Updates link on your dashboard for any updates to the passing requirement.


                     What Topics Will I See on the Exam?
                     The questions you will see on the Series 7 exam do not appear in any particular order.
                     The computer is programmed to select a new, random set of questions for each exam
                     taker, selecting questions according to the preset topic weighting of the exam. Each Series
                     7 candidate will see the same number of questions on each topic, but a different mix of
                     questions. The Series 7 exam is divided into four major job function areas.

                         Test candidates should be aware that within each major job function, FINRA has identified
                         tasks and knowledge statements that test questions are based on. The complete Series 7
                         General Securities Representative Qualification Examination Content Outline can be viewed
                         on FINRA’s website: www.finra.org.

                         When you complete your exam, you will receive a printout that identifies your performance
                         in each of the four major job function areas.


              PREPARING FOR THE EXAM

                         How Is the LEM Organized?
                         The LEM is organized into four parts corresponding to the four listed functions. Each part is
                         divided into units. There is a glossary that can help clarify unfamiliar terms you come across,
                         and an index makes it easy to locate content within the LEM. Look for unique features
                         created to help you understand and comprehend the material.

                         There is a PDF of the LEM on your dashboard. If you open the PDF, you can then search the
                         LEM for key words by pressing Ctrl + F.

                         When additional emphasis is critical to your success, the following distinctions are made.

                                   TAKE NOTE
                                   Each Take Note provides special information designed to amplify important points.

                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                   Each Test Topic Alert! highlights content that is likely to appear on the exam.

                                   EXAMPLE
                                   Examples provide practical applications that convert theory into understanding.


                         Additional Study Resources
                         To accompany and supplement your LEM, your study package may contain additional study
                         resources. Be sure to spend some time on your dashboard, view the best practices video, and
                         understand all that is available to help you study.

           x          Introduction



                                     SecuritiesPro™ QBank
                                     Coordinating with the LEM, the SecuritiesPro™ QBank includes a large number of questions
                                     that are similar in style and content to those you will encounter on the exam. You may use
                                     it to generate tests by a specific unit or combination of units. The QBank also allows you
                                     to create weighted (simulated) mock exams that mimic your test. There is no limit on the
                                     number of QBank exams you can create.

                                     One thing you should know about the QBank is that the answer choices are scrambled each
                                     time you take a test. That is, if the first time you saw a specific question, the correct answer
                                     was choice A, that statement might be choice D the next time. Please keep this in mind if you
                                     need to contact us regarding that question.


                                     Practice and Mastery Exams
                                     Depending on the study package purchased, you may also have a fixed practice exam or a
                                     fixed practice and mastery exam. These exams are designed to closely replicate the true exam
                                     experience, both in terms of the degree of difficulty and topical coverage. They provide scores
                                     and diagnostic feedback, but you will not be given access to—nor will you be able to obtain
                                     from Kaplan—correct answers or question explanations. The practice and mastery exams are
                                     sound indicators of potential actual exam scores—the better you do on these exams, the more
                                     likely you are to pass your actual exam. These may be taken just once each.


                                     Video Library
                                     You may also have access to various topics from our video library. These short, engaging videos
                                     cover key topics from your manual. If your package includes access to our video library, please
                                     review the topics as you complete your reading assignments in the study manual.


                                     Exam Tips & Content Updates Link
                                     Don’t forget to monitor your Exam Tips & Content Updates. When rules and regulations
                                     change, or we want to share new information regarding your exam, it’s posted there.

                                     In addition, try as we may, in a text this large, errors are difficult to avoid. When we become
                                     aware of them, we acknowledge them in the Corrections tab, also located on your dashboard.


                                     What Topics Are Covered in the Course?
                                     The LEM consists of 20 units, each devoted to a particular area of study that you will need to
                                     know to pass the Series 7. Each unit is divided into lessons devoted to more specific areas with
                                     which you need to become familiar.

                                     The Series 7 LEM’s table of contents provides a listing of all the lessons.


                                     How Much Time Should I Spend Studying?
                                     Plan to spend approximately 75–100 hours reading the material and carefully answering the
                                     questions. Spread your study time over the three to four weeks before the date on which you
                                     are scheduled to take the Series 7 exam. Your actual time may vary depending on your reading
                                     rate, comprehension, professional background, and study environment.

                                                                                                    Introduction        xi


                      What Is the Best Way to Structure My Study Time?
                      The first thing you should do is create a study calendar. Information on the study calendar is
                      located on your homepage.

                      The following schedule is suggested to help you obtain maximum retention from your study
                      efforts. Remember, this is a guideline only, because each individual may require more or less
                      time to complete the steps included.


                      Step 1
                      Read a unit and complete all exercises. Review rationales for all questions whether you got
                      them right or wrong (two to three hours per unit).


                      Step 2
                      In the SecuritiesPro™ QBank, create a minimum of QBank exams as defined by your study
                      calendar. Carefully review all rationales. Use the reference number to locate additional or
                      related information on the test topic in your LEM if needed (two to three hours per unit).
                       Do not become too overwhelmed or bogged down in any one unit. You don’t want to
                        lose sight of the finish line because you’re having trouble with one hurdle. Keep moving
                        forward. It’s a steady pace that wins the race.
                       View rationales after each question initially, and spend time studying each rationale in
                        order to learn the concepts. Later, you will want to create exam scenarios in which scores
                        and rationales are viewed at the end of each exam.
                       Perfection is not the goal during the reading phase; scores in the mid- to high-60s are
                        good initially.


                      Step 3
                      When you have completed all the units in the LEM and their unit tests, using the
                      SecuritiesPro™ QBank, concentrate on simulated exams covering all the material. With your
                      comprehensive testing, it is best to view correct answers and rationales only after the test is
                      completed. Plan to spend at least one week testing before a scheduled class (about two hours
                      for every 100 questions).
                       You should complete at least eight simulated exams before class. Review your answers and
                        rationales. Also, review your LEM and video library as needed.
                       Your goal is to consistently score in the 80s.


                      Step 4
                      Complete online practice and mastery exams. You should complete each exam, while
                      observing the time limits for the actual exam. Upon completing the exam, you will receive
                      a diagnostic report that identifies topics for further review (about two hours per exam). We
                      recommend taking the practice and mastery exams after a scheduled class.

                      Note: After completing practice, mastery, and mock exams, be sure to review your
                      Performance Tracker so you can identify areas of weakness. You can then create focused
                      exams on topics as needed. Also, review your LEM and video library for additional help.

                                     Remember, you will not see the answer keys and rationales for the practice or mastery exams,
                                     but the detailed diagnostic breakdown will provide you with clear guidance on areas where
                                     further study is required.


                                     How Well Can I Expect to Do?
                                     The exams administered by FINRA are challenging. You must display considerable
                                     understanding and knowledge of the topics presented in this course to pass the exam and
                                     qualify for registration.

                                     Our practice questions were carefully crafted to simulate the actual exam. In addition,
                                     weighting was considered (i.e., the number of questions likely seen on each topic). The
                                     wording must be somewhat different, but if you understand the subject matter, you will be
                                     able to find the correct response when you sit for the test. We often add new questions to
                                     refresh our question bank, sometimes with no direct supporting information pertaining to a
                                     specific question’s subject in our LEM. In that case, there will be a thorough rationale to help
                                     you capture and retain the information you need. Because complex questions require you
                                     to link different concepts together to arrive at a correct answer, dealing with questions not
                                     directly addressed in the LEM will help develop that skill.

                                     If you study diligently, complete all sections of the course, and consistently score at least 85%
                                     on the tests, you should be well prepared to pass the exam. However, it is important for you
                                     to realize that merely knowing the answers to our questions will not enable you to pass unless
                                     you understand the essence of the information behind the question.


           TEST-TAKING TIPS
                                     Passing the exam depends not only on how well you learn the subject matter but also on how
                                     well you take exams. You can develop your test-taking skills—and improve your score—by
                                     learning a few test-taking techniques.
                                      Read the full question.
                                      Avoid jumping to conclusions—watch for hedge clauses.
                                      Interpret the unfamiliar question.
                                      Look for key words and phrases.
                                      Identify the intent of the question.
                                      Memorize key points.
                                      Use a calculator.
                                      Beware of changing answers.
                                      Pace yourself.
                                     Each of these pointers is explained in the following, including examples that show how to use
                                     them to improve your performance on the exam.


                                     Read the Full Question
                                     You cannot expect to answer a question correctly if you do not know what it is asking. If
                                     you see a question that seems familiar and easy, you might anticipate the answer, mark it,
                                     and move on before you finish reading it. This is a serious mistake. Be sure to read the full
                                     question before answering it. Mistakes are often made when assuming too much (or too
                                     little).

                                                                                                     Introduction      xiii


                      Avoid Jumping to Conclusions—Watch for Hedge Clauses
                      The questions on FINRA exams are often embellished with deceptive distractors as choices. To
                      avoid being misled by seemingly obvious answers, make it a practice to read each question and
                      each answer twice before selecting your choice. Doing so will provide you with a much better
                      chance of doing well on the exam.

                      Watch out for hedge clauses embedded in the question. (Examples of hedge clauses include
                      the terms if, not, all, none, and except.) In the case of if statements, the question can be
                      answered correctly only by taking into account the qualifier. If you ignore the qualifier, you
                      will not answer correctly.

                      Qualifiers are sometimes combined in a question. Some that you will frequently see together
                      are all with except and none with except. In general, when a question starts with all or none and
                      ends with except, you are looking for an answer that is opposite to what the question appears
                      to be asking.


                      Interpret the Unfamiliar Question
                      Do not be surprised if some questions on the exam seem unfamiliar at first. If you have
                      studied your material, you will have the information to answer all the questions correctly. The
                      challenge may be a matter of understanding what the question is asking.

                      Very often, questions present information indirectly. You may have to interpret the meaning
                      of certain elements before you can answer the question. Be aware that the exam will approach
                      a concept from different angles.


                      Look for Key Words and Phrases
                      Look for words that are tip-offs to the situation presented. For example, if you see the word
                      prospectus in the question, you know the question is about a new issue. Sometimes a question
                      will even supply you with the answer if you can recognize the key words it contains. Few
                      questions provide blatant clues, but many do offer key words that can guide you to selecting
                      the correct answer if you pay attention. Be sure to read all instructional phrases carefully. Take
                      time to identify the key words to answer this type of question correctly.


                      Identify the Intent of the Question
                      Many questions on FINRA exams supply so much information that you lose track of what
                      is being asked. This is often the case in story problems. Learn to separate the story from the
                      question.

                      Take the time to identify what the question is asking. Of course, your ability to do so assumes
                      you have studied sufficiently. There is no method for correctly answering questions if you
                      don’t know the material.


                      Memorize Key Points
                      Reasoning and logic will help you answer many questions, but you will have to memorize a
                      good deal of information. Some memorization will be automatic as you go over the material
                      and answer questions; some you will simply have to do systematically.

           xiv        Introduction



                                     Use a Calculator
                                     Most of the questions found on FINRA exams requiring calculations are written so that any
                                     math needed is simple in nature and function. However, using a calculator is recommended
                                     to ensure that common math errors do not lead you to incorrect answers. While test centers
                                     generally have calculators available for your use, you should have a simple function calculator
                                     with you, if needed in case of test center shortages. Test center staff will advise you as to
                                     whether or not you may use your own calculator.


                                     Avoid Changing Answers
                                     If you are unsure of an answer, your first hunch is the one most likely to be correct. Do not
                                     change answers on the exam without good reason. In general, change an answer only if you
                                      discover that you did not read the question correctly; or
                                      find new or additional helpful information in another question.


                                     Pace Yourself
                                     Some people will finish the exam early, and some do not have time to finish all the questions.
                                     Watch the time carefully (your time remaining will be displayed on your computer screen),
                                     and pace yourself through the exam.

                                     Do not waste time by dwelling on a question if you simply do not know the answer. Make
                                     the best guess you can, mark the question for Record for Review, and return to the question if
                                     time allows. Make sure that you have time to read all the questions so that you can record the
                                     answers you do know.


           THE EXAM

                                     How Do I Enroll in the Exam?
                                     To obtain admission to a FINRA-administered exam, your firm must electronically apply
                                     for and pay a fee to FINRA through its Central Registration Depository, better known as
                                     the Web CRD®. To take the exam, you must make an appointment with a Prometric Testing
                                     Center as far in advance as possible to get the date you would like to sit for the exam.

                                     You may schedule, reschedule, or cancel your exam, locate a test center, and get a printed
                                     confirmation of your appointment 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
                                      Prometric secure website at www.prometric.com, 1-800-578-6273.
                                     You must have your Central Registration Depository (CRD) number available when
                                     scheduling your exam. This unique personal identification number should be provided to you
                                     by your employing member firm. On a cautionary note, failure to show for an examination
                                     will be permanently recorded on your examination history on the Web CRD.


                                     What Should I Take to the Exam?
                                     Take one form of personal identification with your signature and photograph as issued
                                     by a government agency. No personal items, food, or drink, including coffee and water,
                                     are permitted inside the testing room. Personal items include, but are not limited to, the

                      outerwear, purses, and wallets. Personal items must be kept in your assigned locker or
                      returned to your car before the start of your exam. Because the testing vendor is not
                      responsible for any personal items, you are encouraged to bring only your identification into
                      the Center.

                      Erasable note boards and pens will be provided to you upon admittance to the testing room.
                      If you need additional note boards or pens, please alert your proctor. The note boards and
                      pens must be returned at the end of your exam or continuing education session.

                      If you need a calculator for your testing session, please see the Test Center Administrator. You
                      will be provided with a nonprogrammable, nonprinting calculator.


                      Additional Trial Questions
                      During your exam, you will see extra (10 for the Series 7 exam) trial questions. These are
                      potential future exam-bank questions being tested during the course of the exam. These
                      questions are not included in your final score and will not be identified.


                      Exam Results and Reports
                      At the end of the exam, your results will be displayed, indicating whether you passed. If you
                      passed, no score will be given. The next business day after your exam, your results will be
                      mailed to your firm and to the self-regulatory organization and State Securities Commission
                      specified on your application.

           ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE EXAM
                      As stated earlier in the introduction in the License Exam Manual (LEM), passing this exam
                      is a requirement to qualify as a general securities registered representative of a Financial
                      Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) member firm. What exactly does that mean? First of
                      all, FINRA is the primary regulator of entities engaged in the business of buying and selling
                      securities. Those businesses are known as broker-dealers. Unless qualifying for an exemption,
                      they must become members of FINRA. Individuals, such as yourself, who represent them,
                      must register. The category of registration is based on the type of securities they will be selling
                      and their individual function. As a Series 7 registered representative, you will be able to sell
                      almost any type of security. You will be doing so under the supervision of an employee of the
                      firm. That person will be registered as a principal. Registration as a principal is required for
                      those with a supervisory function.

                      You should be aware this is a top-off exam. That means you must have the Securities Industry
                      Essentials (SIE) qualification. Alternatively, FINRA grandfathers those who, as of October
                      1, 2018, had an existing FINRA registration, such as a Series 6 or Series 22. FINRA expects
                      those folks to be familiar with industry basics.

                      FINRA states that the SIE is a co-requisite exam. In reality, almost all of our students who are
                      not grandfathered take the SIE before enrolling in the Series 7 Top-Off. Therefore, this course
                      will assume that you know the basics of the industry, such as the difference between a stock
                      and bond or an asset and a liability.

              INTRODUCTION
                         As a general securities registered representative, one of the functions you might be performing
                         is opening accounts for new clients of your employing member firm. To engage in securities
                         transactions, investors must open an account with a broker-dealer. In concept, this is no
                         different from opening an account at a bank if you want to have a checking account. In this
                         unit, we will describe the different types of accounts you may see on your exam.

           4         Unit 1   Types of Accounts



           LESSON 1.1: TYPES OF CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS
                                       LO 1.a Recognize the different types of accounts offered to clients.



                                       Cash Account
                                       There are a number of different types of accounts that may be opened at a broker-dealer. We
                                       are going to start with the two most common. Those are the cash account and the margin
                                       account.

                                       A cash account is the basic investment account, and anyone eligible to open an investment
                                       account can open one. In a cash account, a customer must pay in full for any securities
                                       purchased. Although, as with almost everything in this course, there are exceptions for exam
                                       purposes. Certain accounts, all of which will be described shortly, may only be opened as cash
                                       accounts, including
                                        personal retirement accounts, such as IRAs;
                                        corporate retirement accounts, such as 401(k)s; and
                                        custodial accounts, such as Uniform Transfer to Minors Act accounts, and Coverdell
                                         Education Savings Account (ESA).


                                       Margin Account
                                       In a margin account, the customer can use some cash and some credit to purchase securities.
                                       The use of borrowed money is referred to as financial leverage. This is because investors can
                                       buy more securities using credit than they can using just cash. In concept, this is no different
                                       from buying a home with a mortgage; most people can’t afford to pay in full so, after a down
                                       payment, they borrow the rest using the home as collateral.

                                       In this business, the securities firm lends the necessary funds at the time of purchase, with the
                                       securities in the portfolio serving as collateral for the loan. This is called buying securities on
                                       margin. The term margin refers to the minimum amount of equity a customer must deposit to
                                       buy securities. The shortfall between the purchase price and the amount of money put in is a
                                       loan from the securities firm, and the customer will incur interest costs, just as with any other
                                       loan.

                                       Anytime borrowed money is involved, there is greater risk. This is because the borrow money
                                       is a debt that must be repaid. Because of this higher risk, customers who open margin
                                       accounts must meet certain minimal suitability requirements. Leveraging can be beneficial
                                       when the security’s price is moving up, but it can result in a loss greater than the original
                                       investment if the security’s price goes against the investor.

                                       This risk is the primary reason why margin transactions are not available for use within certain
                                       types of accounts, such as retirement accounts or custodial accounts for minor children.

                                       We’ll have lots more to say about margin accounts in LO 16.d.


                                       Fee-Based Account
                                       Many firms offer investors fee-based accounts that charge a single fee (either fixed or a
                                       percentage of assets in the account) instead of commission-based charges for brokerage
                                       services.



Series_7_2E.indb 4                                                                                                                    11/19/2021 7:52:00 PM
                                                                                        Unit 1   Types of Accounts        5


                     FINRA states that fee-based accounts are appropriate only for investors who engage in at least
                     a moderate level of trading activity. Accounts with a low level of trading activity may be better
                     off with commission-based charges. Rules require that, before opening a fee-based account,
                     investors be given a disclosure document describing the services to be provided and the cost.

                     One of the benefits of fee-based accounts is that they tend to reduce the likelihood of                     Unit 1
                     abusive sales practices. Primary among those abuses is churning. Churning is the illegal and
                     unethical practice that occurs when a broker-dealer or one of its registered representatives
                     engages in excessive buying and selling of securities in a customer’s account chiefly to generate
                     commissions that benefit the broker. A red flag signaling churning could be frequent in-
                     and-out purchases and sales of securities that don’t appear necessary to fulfill the customer’s
                     investment goals.

                     On the other hand, these accounts have introduced a new concept to the industry—reverse
                     churning. Every year, FINRA publishes a list of regulatory priorities for that year. The 2018
                     report stated they were concerned about, “situations in which registered representatives
                     recommend a switch from a brokerage account to a fee-based where that switch clearly
                     disadvantages the customer.” What that meant in simple terms is that member firms were
                     moving low-trading activity clients into accounts where they were charged a fixed fee that
                     turned out to be higher than what they would have paid in commissions.

                     Fee-based accounts are not wrap accounts. Wrap-fee accounts are accounts for which firms
                     provide a group of advisory services in addition to brokerage services. Those might include
                     asset allocation, portfolio management, executions, and administration. The account is
                     charged a single fee. The fee is usually a percentage of assets being managed. Firms offering
                     wrap accounts are generally required to register as investment advisers. This would be in
                     addition to their registration as a broker-dealer.


                     Prime Brokerage Account
                     A prime brokerage account is one in which a customer—generally an institution—selects
                     one member firm (the prime broker) to provide custody, trading, and other services, while
                     other firms, called executing brokers, typically execute most of the trades placed by the
                     customer. To open a prime brokerage account for a customer, a member (the prime broker)
                     must sign an agreement with the customer, spelling out the terms of the agreement, as well
                     as names of all executing brokers the customer has contracted with. The prime broker will
                     then enter into written agreements with each executing broker named by the customer.
                     The customer receives trade confirmations and account statements from the prime broker,
                     who facilitates the clearance and settlement of the securities transactions. Responsibility for
                     compliance of certain trading rules rests with the executing brokers.

                     The key advantage of a prime brokerage account is that it usually provides a client with the
                     ability to trade with multiple brokerage houses while maintaining a centralized master account
                     with all of the client’s cash and securities. In essence, the prime brokerage firm is acting like a
                     construction general contractor dealing with all of the participants in the job.

                     A prime brokerage account often includes a list of specialized services, such as securities
                     lending, margin financing, trade processing, cash management, and operational support.
                     Prime brokerage accounts are likely to be offered to a broker-dealer’s more active trading
                     clients—like hedge funds, for example—who may require a number of executing broker
                     outlets to conduct their transactions and who can benefit by having margin requirements that
                     are netted across all of the prime broker’s positions.

                                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  1.   An IRA account at a broker-dealer must be set up as
                                                        A. a cash account.
                                                        B. a margin account.
                                                        C. a fee-based account.
                                                        D. a prime broker account.
                                                       Answer: A. IRAs can only be opened in cash accounts.


                                       Delivery vs. Payment (DVP); Receipt vs. Payment (RVP)
                                       In a DVP/RVP arrangement, payment for securities purchased is made to the selling
                                       customer’s agent, and/or delivery of securities sold is made to the buying customer’s agent in
                                       exchange for payment at time of settlement. Normally used for institutional accounts, this is a
                                       cash-on-delivery settlement. The broker-dealer handling the trade must verify the arrangement
                                       between the customer and the bank or depository, and the customer must notify the bank or
                                       depository of each purchase or sale. Later in the course, we’ll cover a unique 35-day rule that
                                       applies to these transactions.

                                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  2.   An institutional customer would like to use one broker-dealer to handle the
                                                       administration of the account, but would like to use various other broker-dealers to

                                                       customer’s needs?
                                                        A. An advisory account
                                                        B. A prime brokerage account
                                                        C. A fee-based account
                                                        D. A DVP account
                                                       Answer: B. A prime brokerage account is one in which a customer, generally an
                                                       institution, selects one member firm (the prime broker) to provide custody and
                                                       other services, while other firms, called executing brokers, handle most of the trades
                                                       placed by the customer.


                                       Pattern Day Trading Account
                                       A day trader is someone who buys and sells the same security on the same day to try to
                                       take advantage of intraday price movements. A pattern day trader is someone who executes
                                       four or more day trades in a five-business-day period. The minimum equity requirement for
                                       pattern day traders is $25,000. That means they must have on deposit at least $25,000 in the
                                       account equity on any day in which day trading occurs.

                                       Member firms who promote day trading strategies must implement procedures to approve day
                                       trading accounts.

                                       Before opening an account, the member must
                                        provide the customer with a risk disclosure statement that outlines all the risks associated
                                         with day trading (the statement can be furnished in writing or electronically), and
                                        approve the account for a day trading strategy or receive from the customer a written
                                         statement that the customer does not intend to engage in day trading.

                                       There are special margin rules for these accounts and they will be covered later in the course.

              LESSON 1.2: ACCOUNT REGISTRATIONS
                         LO 1.b Compare various account registration types for natural persons.

                         There are many different registration types available when opening an account at a broker-                 Unit 1
                         dealer. Let’s take a look at them one at a time.


                         Individual Account
                         An individual account is just that—an account with one owner. The account holder is the
                         only person who may
                          control the investments within the account and
                          request distributions of cash or securities from the account.
                         Suitability is based solely on the individual.


                         Multiple Owner Accounts
                         There are several types of accounts with multiple owners covered on the exam. These are
                         generally referred to as joint accounts, although we do include one for which that term is not
                         appropriate.


                         Joint Accounts
                         In a joint account, two or more adults are named on the account as co-owners, with each
                         allowed some form of control over the account. In addition to filling out the appropriate new
                         account form, a joint account agreement must be signed.

                         The account forms for joint accounts require the signatures of all owners. The owners are
                         called tenants. Joint account agreements allow any or all tenants to transact business in the
                         account. Checks must be made payable to the names in which the account is registered and
                         must be endorsed for deposit by all tenants (although mail need be sent to only a single
                         address). When securities are sold from a joint account, the certificate must be signed by all
                         tenants.

                         The suitability requirements for a joint account follow the same basic rules as all accounts.
                         You must put the interest of the client first. Because a joint account is really nothing other
                         than a collection of individuals, suitability information must be obtained on all of the account
                         owners. Any recommendations must be appropriate based upon that information. In other
                         words, the suitability of recommendations must be based on the group, not on any individual
                         within the group.


                         Joint Tenants With Rights of Survivorship (JTWROS)
                         Joint tenants with rights of survivorship (JTWROS) ownership stipulates that a deceased
                         tenant’s interest in the account passes to the surviving tenant(s). That is why JTWROS is most
                         common for spouses. In these accounts, the ownership is equal.

                                       Tenants in Common (TIC)
                                       Tenants in common (TIC) ownership provides that a deceased tenant’s fractional share in the
                                       account goes to that tenant’s estate. TICs are most commonly used for nonspousal relatives or
                                       friends. In these accounts, the ownership can be unequal.

                                                  EXAMPLE
                                                  Suppose a TIC agreement provides for a 60% ownership interest by one owner and a
                                                  40% ownership interest by the other. If the 60% owner dies first, 60% of the account
                                                  would pass into the deceased owner’s estate. The TIC agreement may be used by
                                                  more than two individuals.

                                                  TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                      JTWROS—all parties have an undivided interest in the account
                                                      TIC—each party must specify a percentage interest in the account
                                                  Checks or distributions must be made payable to all parties and endorsed by all
                                                  parties.

                                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  3.   Several investors open an account as tenants in common (TIC). For suitability
                                                       purposes, financial information is required on which of the following investors?
                                                        A. Most of the investors
                                                        B. The largest investor only
                                                        C. Only the one authorized to trade the account
                                                        D. All of the investors
                                                       Answer: D. When a joint account is opened, to be able to make suitable
                                                       recommendations, financial information should be obtained on all of the account
                                                       owners.


                                       Community Property
                                       Community property is a marital property classification recognized by some, but not all
                                       states. Because it is not in universal use, it will most likely appear as a wrong answer choice
                                       on the exam. Following are some of the basics in case you do have a question. In these
                                       states, most property acquired during the marriage is considered to be owned jointly by both
                                       spouses and would be divided at the time of divorce, annulment, or death. Joint ownership
                                       is therefore automatically presumed by law in these jurisdictions. Exceptions are made for
                                       inheritances, gifts, or any property that is owned by one spouse before marriage. That is
                                       considered the separate property of that spouse, unless it was designated to be owned jointly
                                       by both spouses during the marriage.

                                       It is important to know that community property law differs from state to state. Some states
                                       have created separate classifications called community property with rights of survivorship that
                                       are similar to joint tenancy with rights of survivorship property designations.

                               PRACTICE QUESTION
                               4.   All of the following are true regarding community property except
                                     A. property acquired before marriage is considered to be jointly owned.
                                     B. community property is considered to be owned jointly by both spouses and

                                                                                                                                Unit 1
                                           would be divided at the time of divorce, annulment, or death.
                                     C. not all states are community property states.
                                     D. an exception to community property is for property that was inherited.
                                    Answer: A. Property acquired before marriage is considered to be owned separately,
                                    not jointly, as stated in the answer choice. Each of the other choices is a true
                                    statement.


                     Custodial Accounts
                     Custodial accounts are not technically joint accounts as there is only one owner but there
                     are two names on the account. Those names are the custodian and the beneficial owner, the
                     minor. The original format was under the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA). That was
                     replaced by the Uniform Transfer to Minors Act (UTMA). As of the date of this printing,
                     only one state still uses UGMA, with all of the rest relying on UTMA. The reason for these
                     accounts is because, under the law, a minor is not considered a legal person. That is, a minor
                     cannot be held to contracts.

                     In a custodial account, the custodian for the minor enters all trades. UGMA and UTMA
                     accounts require an adult to act as custodian for a minor (the beneficial owner).

                     The Uniform Law Commissioners adopted UGMA in 1956. The primary focus then was to
                     provide a convenient way to make gifts of money and securities to minors. Later, it became
                     clear that a more flexible law was desirable. The Uniform Law Commissioners adopted
                     UTMA in 1986. UTMA expands the types of property you can transfer to a minor, and
                     provides that you can make other types of transfers besides gifts. The essential principles of
                     both acts are the same; the primary difference is the greater flexibility of UTMA.

                     Securities in an UGMA/UTMA account are managed by a custodian until the minor reaches
                     the age of majority, or in the case of UTMA, the age determined by the specific state. The
                     custodian has full control over the minor’s account and can
                      buy or sell securities or other assets, such as real estate, in an UTMA;
                      exercise rights or warrants; and
                      liquidate, trade, or hold securities.
                     The custodian also may use the property in the account in any way the custodian deems
                     proper for the minor’s support, education, maintenance, general use, or benefit. However, the
                     account is not normally used to pay expenses associated with raising a child, such as the three
                     basic needs of food, clothing, and shelter.

                     Registered representatives should know the following UGMA/UTMA custodial account rules:
                      All gifts, (and transfers in the case of UTMA), are irrevocable.
                      An account may have only one custodian and one minor or beneficial owner.
                      A donor of securities can act as custodian or appoint someone to do so.
                      Unless acting as a custodian, parents have no legal control over an UGMA/UTMA
                       account or the securities in it.

                                                         C. Two friends
                                                         D. Parent and a minor child
                                                        Answer: D. A joint account may be opened by two or more individuals who have
                                                        legal standing. A minor may not be a party in a joint account because minors are
                                                        not legally considered a person. A parent (or any other adult) can be custodian for a
                                                        minor, but that is a single account, not a joint account.


                                        Transfer on Death (TOD)
                                        Transfer on death (TOD) is a type of account registration that allows the owner of the
                                        account to pass all or a portion of it, upon death, to a single or multiple beneficiaries. No
                                        specific legal documents are needed. Furthermore, the beneficiaries and percentages can be
                                        changed as often as desired. TOD avoids probate, but the assets in the account do not avoid
                                        estate tax, if applicable.

                                        TOD accounts are available for individual accounts. They can also be used for certain joint
                                        accounts (JTWROS, but not TIC).

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   6.   Which type of individual account allows for investments held in that account to go
                                                        straight to a named beneficiary outside of probate?
                                                          A. A TOD account
                                                          B. A testamentary account
                                                          C. An account titled JTWROS
                                                         D. An advisory account
                                                        Answer: A. A simple way for an individual account owner to ensure that the assets
                                                        in the account pass directly to the named beneficiary is to use the Transfer on Death
                                                        (TOD) option. Although the assets in a JTWROS account pass to the survivor without
                                                        probate, the question specifies an individual, not a joint account.

              LESSON 1.3: BUSINESS ACCOUNTS
                         LO 1.c Distinguish between the different types of business entities capable of
                         opening accounts.
                                                                                                                                      Unit 1

                         Sole Proprietorship
                         Sole proprietorship is the simplest form of business organization and is treated like an
                         individual account. Therefore, the same issues of suitability that apply to individual accounts
                         apply to the management of sole proprietorship accounts. In a sole proprietorship, all income
                         (or loss) is that of the individual. In fact, one of the risks of operating in this fashion is that
                         all of the owner’s assets are liable for the debts of the business—you can lose everything.
                         Obviously, this is one of the major considerations when opening an account for this form of
                         business.


                         General Partnership
                         A general partnership is an unincorporated association consisting of two or more individuals.
                         In a general partnership, the partners manage and are responsible for the operation and debts
                         of the business. Partnerships are easy to form and easy to dissolve, but are generally not suited
                         for raising large sums of capital. Partnerships allow the profits and losses of the business
                         to flow directly through to the investors as passive income (or loss) for tax purposes, thus
                         avoiding double taxation of profits at the business and individual levels.

                         Because the income and losses flow through to the individual partners, an investment policy
                         for a general partnership would have to consider the combined/collective objectives of all of
                         the partners.


                         Limited Partnership
                         In the case of an enterprise organized as a limited partnership, the management (and liability)
                         is assigned to the general partner(s), while the limited partner(s) are passive and have liability
                         limited to their investment. This is the typical case with the direct participation programs
                         (DPPs) discussed in Unit 11. Suitability decisions are similar to a general partnership except
                         that the limited partners do not have the full liability of the general partner(s).


                         Limited Liability Company (LLC)
                         A limited liability company (LLC) is a business structure that combines benefits of
                         incorporation (limited liability) with the tax advantages of a partnership (flow-through of
                         taxable earnings or losses). The LLC owners are members (not shareholders) and are not
                         personally liable for the debts of the LLC.

                         Just as with the partnership clients described above, the objectives and financial constraints of
                         the individual members must be considered from a suitability standpoint.


                         S Corporation
                         An S corporation, although taxed like a partnership, offers investors the limited liability
                         associated with corporations in general. The profits and losses are passed through directly




Series_7_2E.indb 11                                                                                                       11/19/2021 7:52:07 PM

                                        to the shareholders in proportion to their ownership in the S corporation. Unlike an LLC,
                                        which can have an unlimited number of members, an S corporation may not have more than
                                        100 shareholders, none of whom may be a nonresident alien, or more than one class of stock
                                        (presumably common).

                                        Any business organization client where the entity itself has no liability and is not subject to
                                        tax, such as the partnerships, LLC, and S corporation, requires the adviser to look through the
                                        entity to the owners to properly meet the suitability standards.


                                        C Corporation
                                        A C corporation is a business structure that distinguishes the company as a separate entity
                                        from its owners. If a business expects to need significant capital, this form is almost always
                                        the preferred choice. Unlike the management of a partnership [the general partner(s)], in
                                        most cases, the corporation’s officers and directors are shielded from personal liability for
                                        the corporation’s debts and losses. Shareholders are also shielded from corporate creditors.
                                        That is the limited liability benefit of owning stock. Corporate income tax applies to the
                                        corporation as an entity rather than being passed through to the shareholder. If your client is
                                        a C corporation, you will only look at the corporation’s financial needs and objectives when
                                        determining suitability.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   C corporation earnings are subject to double taxation. Before distribution, the
                                                   earnings are taxable to the corporation and then are taxed again to the shareholder
                                                   when paid out as a dividend. Distributions from LLCs and S corporations are taxed
                                                   only once because there is no taxation at the business entity level.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   7.   Three friends plan to start a new business. It is anticipated it will be several
                                                        years before the business turns a profit. Which of the following types of business
                                                        organization would be best if they wish to limit their liability while, at the same time,
                                                        being able to receive favorable tax treatment for the expected losses?
                                                         A. C corporation
                                                         B. S corporation

                                                         D. Sole proprietorship
                                                        Answer: B. The only way to limit liability is through a corporation (or LLC or limited
                                                        partnership—neither of which is offered here as a choice). The S corporation allows
                                                        for the flow-through of operating losses to the shareholders, while the C corporation
                                                        does not.

                                        LO 1.d Explain the requirements for opening customer accounts.

                                        In the previous two LOs, we described the various types of accounts opened at broker-dealers.
                                        What are the legal requirements for opening up the accounts for natural persons?

                      New Account Form
                      Opening an account begins with the new account form. FINRA Rule 4512 requires that
                      member firms create a record for each account with an individual customer that includes the
                      following information:
                       Customer’s name and residence address                                                                      Unit 1
                       Whether the customer is of legal age
                       Name(s) of the firm’s associated person(s), if any, responsible for the account
                       If the customer is a corporation, partnership or other legal entity, the names of any
                        persons authorized to transact business on behalf of the entity
                       Signature of the partner, officer, or manager denoting that the account has been accepted
                        in accordance with the member’s policies and procedures for acceptance of accounts
                       Subject to the Trusted Person Contact Rule, (2165), name of and contact information
                        for a trusted contact person age 18 or older who may be contacted about the customer’s
                        account

                                TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                The customer’s signature is not required on the new account form. The only signature
                                required to open an account is a partner, officer, or manager (a principal) signifying
                                that the account has been accepted in accordance with the member’s policies and
                                procedures for acceptance of accounts. SEC Rule 17a-3 requires delivery of a copy of
                                the account information within 30 days of opening (and every 36 months thereafter).
                                Customers are to verify the information and note any relevant changes to the
                                information.
                      In addition to the earlier stipulations, FINRA asks that each member also make reasonable
                      efforts to obtain, before the settlement of the initial transaction in the account, the following
                      information to the extent it is applicable to the account:
                       The customer’s tax identification or Social Security number
                       The occupation of customer and name and address of employer
                       Whether the customer is an associated person of another member

                                TAKE NOTE
                                The firm wants to know if any person opening an account is an insider (office, director,
                                or major shareholder) of a public company. The reasons will come up later in the
                                course when we discuss insider trading and restricted stock.
                      Member firms must make a good-faith effort to obtain this information. However, if the
                      customer neglects or refuses to provide all the information, or is unable to provide it, then the
                      rule excuses the firm.


                      Customer Identification Program (CIP)
                      Under provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, financial institutions, such as broker-
                      dealers, are required to institute a customer identification program (CIP) designed to
                       verify the identity of any new customer;
                        – for an individual, an unexpired government-issued identification such as a driver’s

                                          prohibit transactions with certain persons and organizations listed on the OFAC website
                                          as Terrorists and Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons, as well as listed
                                          embargoed countries and regions. Firms must check this list on an ongoing basis to
                                          ensure that potential customers and existing customers are not prohibited persons or
                                          entities and are not from embargoed countries or regions before transacting any business
                                          with them.

                                        These rules are designed to prevent, detect, and prosecute money laundering and the financing
                                        of terrorism.

                                        As part of its CIP, a member firm must, before opening an account, obtain the following
                                        information at a minimum:
                                         Customer name
                                         Date of birth (for an individual)
                                         Address, which must be:
                                          – for an individual, a residential or business street address
                                            –      for an individual who does not have a residential or business street address, an Army
                                                   Post Office or Fleet Post Office box number, or the residential or business street
                                                   address of a next of kin or another contact individual
                                            –      for a person other than an individual (such as a corporation, partnership, or trust), a
                                                   principal place of business, local office, or other physical location
                                         Social Security number for an individual or Tax ID number for a business entity
                                         For a non-U.S. person, one or more of the following: a taxpayer identification number,
                                          a passport number and country of issuance, an alien identification card number, or the
                                          number and country of issuance of any other government-issued document evidencing
                                          nationality or residence and bearing a photograph or similar safeguard. An exception is
                                          granted to persons who do not currently have, but who have applied for, a Social Security
                                          number. In this instance, the firm must obtain the number within a reasonable period
                                          and the account card must be marked applied for.

                                        The CIP must include procedures for responding to circumstances in which the broker-dealer
                                        cannot form a reasonable belief that it knows the true identity of a customer. These procedures
                                        should describe
                                         when the broker-dealer should not open an account,
                                         the terms under which a customer may conduct transactions while the broker-dealer
                                          attempts to verify the customer’s identity,
                                         when the broker-dealer should close an account after attempts to verify a customer’s
                                          identity fail, and
                                         when the broker-dealer should file a suspicious activity report in accordance with
                                          applicable law and regulation.

                      Opening Accounts for Other Members’ Employees
                      Regulatory bodies have rules and special procedures regarding the establishment of accounts
                      for certain individuals, including
                       employees of member firms and
                       spouses or minor children of member firm employees.                                                       Unit 1

                      The FINRA rule requires that a person associated with a member, before opening an account
                      or placing an initial securities order with another member, notify the employer and the
                      executing member (where the new account is to be maintained), in writing, of her association
                      with the other member.

                      Before the account can be opened, the employing FINRA member firm must grant written
                      permission. Prior written consent from the employer is specified within the rule.

                      Upon written request from the employing member firm, the executing member must supply
                      to the employing member duplicate copies of confirmations, account statements, or any other
                      account information requested.
                      There are some exceptions. If the employee is purchasing mutual funds or variable annuities
                      directly from the issuer, the rule does not apply. In addition, the rule does not apply when the
                      employee is purchasing non-securities products, such as fixed annuities or term life insurance.

                      The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) rule is almost the same. The major
                      difference is that sending duplicate confirmations is required, not optional. One of the
                      exceptions is the purchase of municipal fund securities. These are better known as 529 college
                      savings plans.

                                TAKE NOTE
                                These rules only apply when the individual opening the account is employed by or
                                registered with a member firm of FINRA or the MSRB.


                      Trusted Contact Person (Rules 2165 and 4512)
                      As mentioned earlier, there is a requirement to obtain trusted contact information for specified
                      adults. Who is considered a specified adult?

                      Per FINRA Rule 2165, a specified adult “is a natural person age 65 or older or a natural
                      person age 18 or older who the member reasonably believes has a mental or physical
                      impairment that makes the individual unable to protect his own interests.”

                                TAKE NOTE
                                You might see this referred to as the FINRA Senior Exploitation Rule.

                      What do you do if a specified adult opens an account? FINRA requires members to make
                      reasonable efforts to obtain the name of and contact information for a trusted contact person.
                      This person must be someone age 18 or older who may be contacted about the customer’s
                      account. The rules do not require a customer to provide trusted contact information, only that
                      the firm make the effort.

                      Member firms may place a temporary hold on the distribution of funds or securities from
                      the account of a specified adult. The temporary hold is also allowed in certain circumstances
                      where the member reasonably believes that financial exploitation of the specified adult has




Series_7_2E.indb 15                                                                                                   11/19/2021 7:52:13 PM

                                       occurred, is occurring, has been attempted, or will be attempted. FINRA considers temporary
                                       to be up to 15 business days, with the possibility of an extension of 10 business days, with a
                                       final extension for good cause, up to 30 business days totaling 55 business days.

                                       This rule does not require members to place temporary holds on disbursements of funds or
                                       securities from the accounts of specified adults. The rule simply gives them permission to do
                                       so.

                                                  EXAMPLE
                                                  Placing a temporary hold on a customer order to sell shares of stock in the account
                                                  does not apply. However, if the customer requests that the proceeds of the sale be
                                                  wired outside the account, then a temporary hold on the disbursement may take
                                                  place where the customer is covered by the rule and there is a reasonable belief of
                                                  financial exploitation.

                                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  8.   One of your accounts is a specified adult. If the firm reasonably believes that an
                                                       attempt at exploiting the person has been made, a temporary hold is permitted on
                                                       disbursements for
                                                        A. three business days.
                                                        B. five business days.
                                                        C. 55 business days.
                                                        D. 30 calendar days.
                                                       Answer: C. FINRA Rule 2165 permits firms to place a temporary hold (55 business
                                                       days) on disbursements or transactions from the accounts of individuals aged 65 or
                                                       older, and individuals aged 18 or older whom firms reasonably believe have an
                                                       impairment that prevents them from protecting their own interests (a specified
                                                       adult). Firms are permitted to place a temporary hold on funds if the firm has a
                                                       reasonable belief that financial exploitation of the specified adult has or is occurring
                                                       or attempted. This gives the firm time to notify a trusted contact person and to begin
                                                       an internal review.


                                       Regulation S-P (Privacy Notices)
                                       Opening an account usually requires complying with Regulation S-P. This regulation was
                                       enacted by the SEC to protect the privacy of customer information. In particular, the
                                       regulation deals with nonpublic personal information. Examples of nonpublic personal
                                       information include a customer’s Social Security number, account balances, transaction
                                       history, and any information collected through internet cookies. Your firm must provide a
                                       privacy notice describing its privacy policies to customers whenever a new account is opened,
                                       and annually thereafter.

                                       If your firm reserves the right to disclose to unaffiliated third parties nonpublic personal
                                       information, the notice must provide customers a reasonable means to opt out of this
                                       disclosure. Reasonable opt out means include providing customers with a form with check-
                                       off boxes along with a prepaid return envelope, providing an electronic means to opt out for
                                       customers who have agreed to the electronic delivery of information, and providing a toll-free
                                       telephone number. Asking customers to write a letter to express their disclosure preferences or
                                       to opt out would not be considered reasonable under Regulation S-P.

                                       In addition, the regulation embodies the obligation of financial institutions to safeguard
                                       customer information as related to all forms of existing and developing technology. For
                                       example, this would include, but not be limited to, securing desktop and laptop computers
                                       and encrypting email.

                      Regulation S-P distinguishes between a consumer and a customer. A consumer is an
                      individual who obtains a financial product or service from a firm and has no further contact
                      with the firm. A customer is an individual who has an ongoing relationship with a firm.
                      Consumers are given an initial privacy notice only, while customers must be given both an
                      initial and annual privacy notice. Only individuals, not businesses or institutions, are covered
                      by the regulation.                                                                                            Unit 1

                                TAKE NOTE
                                Reasonable opt-out methods available to members include providing a reply form
                                with the opt-out notice, an electronic means to opt out if the customer has agreed to
                                the electronic delivery of information, and a toll-free number that customers may call.
                                The SEC has stated that members are not providing a reasonable means to opt out if
                                the only method to do so is by writing a letter to the member.

                                PRACTICE QUESTION
                                9.   Under Regulation S-P, if a broker-dealer sends a customer an initial privacy notice
                                     that contains an opt-out provision, the firm may not disclose nonpublic, personal
                                     information about that customer for how many days from the mailing?
                                       A. 10
                                       B. 15
                                       C. 20
                                       D. 30
                                     Answer: D. A broker-dealer must give a customer 30 days to implement any opt-out
                                     provision in the privacy notice.


                      Power of Attorney (POA)
                      If a person who is not named on an account is to have trading authority, the customer must
                      file written authorization with the broker-dealer giving that person access to the account.
                      Without this power in writing, no matter how tempting the answer on the exam, activity
                      in the account cannot be created by anyone other than the account owner(s). Trading
                      authorization usually takes the form of a power of attorney. Two basic types of trading
                      authorizations are full power of attorney and limited power of attorney.


                      Full Power of Attorney
                      A full power of attorney allows an individual who is not the owner of an account to
                       deposit or withdraw cash or securities and
                       make investment decisions for the account owner.


                      Limited Power of Attorney
                      A limited power of attorney allows an individual to have some, but not total, control over an
                      account. The document specifies the level of access the person may exercise.

                                TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                Limited power of attorney, also called limited trading authorization, allows entering of
                                buy and sell orders but not the withdrawal of funds. Entry of orders and withdrawal of
                                funds is only allowed if full power of attorney is granted.

                                        Durable Power of Attorney
                                        A full or limited power may be made “durable” by the grantor of the power. It is designed to
                                        provide that a specifically designated person maintains power over the account even upon the
                                        grantor’s incapacitation. This could be because of physical or mental causes. Its most common
                                        use is when providing for aging parents. Upon the death of either principal to the durable
                                        power of attorney, the power is terminated.

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   A durable power of attorney survives the physical or mental incompetence of the
                                                   grantor but not the death of either party.
                                                   This means that orders entered after the time of death of the grantor, even if the
                                                   purchase or sale was decided upon before death, are not accepted.


           LESSON 1.5: ACCOUNT CHANGES

                                        LO 1.e Identify the procedure for account registration changes and transfers.



                                        Approval and Documentation of Changes in Account Name or
                                        Designation
                                        Long before the airwaves were bombarding us with ads for identity theft protection or
                                        methods of keeping your accounts from being hacked, broker-dealers had concerns for the
                                        safety of their customers’ accounts. It was not uncommon for one party of a married couple
                                        to call the registered representative handling their JTWROS account and ask that the other
                                        spouse’s name be removed. In some instances, there was a legitimate reason for the change,
                                        but in many others, it was a preemptive strike in an upcoming divorce.

                                        Well before the exploitation of seniors rule previously discussed was implemented, children or
                                        other relatives of a senior whose cognitive abilities were impaired would attempt (sometimes
                                        successfully) to have their names added to an account.

                                        Under FINRA rules, no change in any account name(s) can be made unless the change has
                                        been authorized by a qualified registered principal designated by the member. This principal
                                        must, before giving her approval of the account designation change, be personally informed
                                        of the essential facts relative thereto and indicate her approval of such change in writing. The
                                        essential facts relied upon by the person approving the change must be documented in writing
                                        and preserved with the customer account records.


                                        Internal Transfers
                                        A close “cousin” of the previous discussion is that of internal transfers. It is not unusual for a
                                        client to have both a cash account and a margin account. A married couple could easily have
                                        five or more accounts between them. There are many good reasons why a client might want
                                        to have funds transferred from one account to another, but there could also be cases where a
                                        party was acting without proper authority. In general, when a transfer is made to an account
                                        from an account of which the recipient is not a signatory, approvals and documentation
                                        similar to a change in designation are required.

                         Bulk Transfers
                         When customers sell securities held in their accounts, cash representing the proceeds of those
                         sales are deposited to their accounts. In many cases, that cash is swept into a money market
                         mutual fund where it will earn income until the money is either withdrawn or used for a new
                                                                                                                                         Unit 1
                         purchase. This is known as a sweep account.

                         Sometimes the broker-dealer has a reason to select a different money market fund for its
                         clients. Contacting each of the clients individually to receive their consent is not practical.
                         Many member firms have thousands or even millions of clients.

                         FINRA rules do permit member firms to make bulk exchanges at net asset value of money
                         market mutual funds utilizing negative response letters without obtaining affirmative consent,
                         but only when specific conditions are met.


                         Definitions: Negative Response Letter
                         A negative response letter generally informs the recipient of the letter of an impending
                         action, and requires the recipient to respond or act within a specified time frame if the
                         recipient objects to the action. If the recipient does not respond, he is deemed to have
                         consented to the action.

                         Those conditions are the following:
                          The bulk exchange is limited to situations involving mergers and acquisitions of funds,
                           changes of clearing members and exchanges of funds used in sweep accounts.
                          The negative response letter contains a tabular comparison of the nature and amount of
                           the fees charged by each fund.
                          The negative response letter contains a comparative description of the investment
                           objectives of each fund and a prospectus of the fund to be purchased.
                          The negative response feature will not be activated until at least 30 days after the letter
                           was mailed.

                                    TAKE NOTE
                                    There is a current FINRA proposal that would greatly expand the usage of negative
                                    response letters for bulk transfers. If that proposal should become effective, we will
                                    add the relevant information to the Content Updates and the q-bank.


              LESSON 1.6: QUALIFIED VS. NONQUALIFIED RETIREMENT PLANS
                         LO 1.f Contrast qualified and nonqualified retirement plans.



                         Definitions
                         As with so much in this course, there are similar terms with sometimes dissimilar meanings.
                         Here is a useful list of terms used in the discussion of retirement plans in the rest of this unit:
                          Tax-deferred. Simply, income tax is put off (deferred) to a later time. In most retirement
                           plans, tax on the amount of the contribution is usually deferred until withdrawal. Tax on
                           the earnings is always deferred until withdrawal.
                          Qualified plan. An employer-sponsored plan, such as a pension, 401(k), or 403(b), where
                           the contributions are made with pretax dollars and earnings in the account grow without



Series_7_2E.indb 19                                                                                                          11/19/2021 7:52:13 PM
           20         Unit 1   Types of Accounts



                                            any tax (tax-deferred) until the funds are withdrawn. Qualified plans are usually governed
                                            by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).
                                         Qualified. This term by itself means that contributions made with pretax dollars and
                                          earnings in the account are tax-deferred until the funds are withdrawn. This can apply to
                                          either a qualified plan or a traditional IRA.
                                         Nonqualified. An employer-sponsored plan, such as a deferred compensation plan,
                                          where there are no tax advantages other than that the pay is not received until sometime
                                          later when the individual should be in a lower tax bracket. Another advantage is that the
                                          employer can discriminate between employees. The term can also apply to an annuity
                                          purchased on an individual basis outside of a retirement plan, as described in Unit 9.
                                         Deductible contribution. The contribution made by the individual, whether an
                                          employee contribution to a qualified plan such as a 401(k) plan, or by any individual to a
                                          traditional IRA. This means the amount contributed is pretax or otherwise deductible on
                                          the tax return.
                                         Nondeductible contribution. A contribution to a qualified plan or an IRA, (traditional
                                          or Roth) which is made with after-tax dollars. The funds do grow tax-deferred, but there
                                          is no tax benefit derived from the contribution.


                                        Employer-Sponsored Retirement Plans
                                        An important goal for many investors is to provide themselves with retirement income. Many
                                        individuals accomplish this through corporate retirement plans, others set up their own plans,
                                        and some have both individual and corporate retirement plans.

                                        There are two basic types of retirement plans in the United States: qualified and nonqualified.
                                        Generally speaking, qualified plans allow pretax contributions to be made, while nonqualified
                                        plans are funded with after-tax money. Both plans can allow money to grow tax-deferred until
                                        needed. There are exceptions to these basic characteristics.

                                        Contribution limits for qualified retirement plans vary and are adjusted from time to time.
                                        Those numbers will not be tested.

                                        A taxable distribution from any retirement plan is taxed as ordinary income, never as a capital
                                        gain.

                                        In a qualified plan, if all of the funds were contributed by the employer, (known as a
                                        noncontributory plan), the employee’s tax basis (cost) is zero. If the employee’s contribution
                                        was pretax, the basis for that is zero as well. Because everything above the cost is taxed at the
                                        employee’s ordinary income rate at the time of distribution, in most cases all funds received
                                        are fully taxable.


                                        Nonqualified Plans
                                        Nonqualified plans may be used to favor certain employees (typically executives) because
                                        nondiscrimination rules are not applicable to nonqualified plans. That is because these plans

                      Deferred Compensation Plan
                      A nonqualified deferred compensation plan is an agreement between a company and an
                      employee in which the employee agrees to defer receipt of current income in favor of payout
                      at retirement. It is assumed that the employee will be in a lower tax bracket at retirement age
                                                                                                                                  Unit 1
                      (persons affiliated with the company solely as board members are not eligible for these plans
                      because they are not considered employees for retirement planning purposes).

                      Deferred compensation plans may be somewhat risky because the employee covered by the
                      plan has no right to plan benefits if the business fails. In this situation, the employee becomes
                      a general creditor of the firm. Covered employees may also forfeit benefits if they leave the
                      firm before retirement.

                      When the benefit is payable at the employee’s retirement, it is taxable as ordinary income to
                      the employee. The employer is entitled to the tax deduction at the time the benefit is paid out.

                                TAKE NOTE
                                Deferred compensation plans usually benefit highly compensated employees who are
                                just a few years from retirement.


                      Payroll Deduction Plan
                      Payroll deduction plans allow employees to authorize their employer to deduct a specified
                      amount for retirement savings from their paychecks. The money is deducted after taxes are
                      paid and may be invested in any number of retirement vehicles at the employee’s option.

                                TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                A 401(k) plan is not considered a payroll deduction plan. For the FINRA exams, 401(k)
                                plans are considered salary reduction plans, not payroll deduction plans. In exam
                                questions, assume that payroll deduction plans are nonqualified. Also note that 401(k)
                                plans are qualified plans, whereas payroll deduction plans are not.

                                PRACTICE QUESTIONS
                                10. Generally speaking, nonqualified retirement plans
                                     A. are funded with after-tax dollars.
                                     B. must have a trust agreement.
                                     C. may not discriminate with regard to who can participate.
                                     D. must have IRS approval.
                                     Answer: A. Generally speaking, nonqualified retirement plans are funded with after-
                                     tax dollars.

                                11. A deferred compensation plan
                                     A. must allow all eligible employees to participate.
                                     B. is funded through a trust agreement that protects the employee in the event
                                          the company goes out of business.
                                     C. might not protect the employee from losing the deferred compensation
                                          should the employee leave the company before retirement.
                                     D. typically benefits younger employees.
                                     Answer: C. A provision commonly found in deferred compensation plans is that the
                                     employee might forfeit some or all of the benefit if she leaves the company before
                                     retirement.

                                        Qualified Plans
                                        As described earlier, most qualified plans offer several specific tax benefits differing from those
                                        in nonqualified ones. Benefits of qualified plans are that
                                         employer contributions are a current deductible expense,
                                         employee contributions are generally made with pretax money,
                                         all earnings and growth in the account is tax-deferred until withdrawal, and
                                         certain protections are offered to employees under ERISA.
                                        We will go into greater detail on these plans in Lesson 1.8.


           LESSON 1.7: ALL ABOUT IRAS
                                        LO 1.g Recall the features of individual retirement arrangements.


                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   On December 20, 2019, Congress passed the Setting Every Community Up for
                                                   Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act. The act contains a number of changes to
                                                   retirement account rules.
                                                   Following are those most likely to affect your exam.
                                                   1.   Effective 2020, individuals with earned income can make IRA contributions to
                                                        a traditional IRA without the former 701/2 age restriction. In that respect, the
                                                        traditional and Roth IRAs are now the same—no upper age limit.
                                                   2.   RMDs will begin after attaining age 72 rather than 701/2.
                                                   3.   There are two additional exceptions to the early withdrawal 10% penalty. They
                                                        are:
                                                        a.   Up to $5,000 during the first year after a child is born, or
                                                        b.   Up to $5,000 during the first year after an eligible person is adopted
                                                             1).	“Eligible adoptee” means anybody under age 18 or who is
                                                                  physically or mentally incapable of self-support regardless of age.
                                                             2).	If married, each spouse can make the $5,000 penalty-free
                                                                  withdrawal.
                                                   4.   Inherited retirement accounts for those dying in 2020 or beyond will now, with
                                                        certain exceptions, require distributions to be completed in a maximum of
                                                        10 years after the original owner's death.
                                                   5.   Rule 529 has added as qualified expenses, amounts paid as principal or interest
                                                        on any qualified education loan for the beneficiary and any siblings. There is a
                                                        maximum of $10,000 lifetime per child.
                                                   6.   ERISA eligibility for 401(k) plans, but not 403(b) and 457 plans: There is an
                                                        alternative to the 1,000 hours worked per year. An employee working 500 or more
                                                        hours per year for three years is now eligible. The purpose of this addition is to
                                                        make it possible for more part-time employees to qualify for coverage.

                                TAKE NOTE
                                Although individual retirement arrangements is the technical IRS term, (not tested),
                                because everyone refers to these as individual retirement accounts (IRAs), we’re going
                                to use this common phrase to avoid confusion.
                      Individual retirement accounts (IRAs) were created to encourage people to save for their                          Unit 1
                      retirement. Any individual with earned income can open and contribute to an IRA. Two types
                      of IRAs may be tested, with different contribution, tax, and distribution characteristics:
                      traditional IRAs and Roth IRAs.

                      IRAs are not to be confused with retirement plans used by businesses. Later in this unit we
                      will cover topics such as pension plans, 401(k) plans, and 457 plans.

                                TAKE NOTE
                                Although we may include some actual contribution limits, it is unlikely that you will
                                have to know any other than the IRA and Coverdell numbers.


                      Traditional IRAs
                      The first of the IRAs we’ll cover is generally referred to as the traditional IRA, although
                      there is no such term in the IRS regulations. This was the first IRA, and as others have been
                      introduced, this first one acquired its name. A traditional IRA allows a maximum tax-
                      deductible annual contribution of the lesser of $6,000 per individual or $12,000 per couple, or
                      100% of taxable compensation for the taxable year 2019. The income and capital gains earned
                      in the account are tax-deferred until the funds are withdrawn.


                      Compensation for IRA Purposes
                      For purposes of contributing to an IRA, the IRS considers the following to be compensation:
                       Wages, salaries, and tips
                       Commissions and bonuses
                       Self-employment income
                       Alimony1
                       Nontaxable combat pay


                      Not Compensation for IRA Purposes
                      For purposes of contributing to an IRA, the IRS does not consider the following to be
                      compensation:
                       Capital gains
                       Interest and dividend income
                       Pension or annuity income



                                1 	
                                      The TCJA of 2017 changed the rules on alimony. For any divorce decree entered into start-
                                      ing January 1, 2019, alimony is no longer considered earned income. This change only
                                      applies to these new divorces and does not change the treatment for those entered into by
                                      December 31, 2018. As a test matter, the date of the divorce decree must be shown so that
                                      you can determine the status of the alimony.

                                        Catch-Up Contributions for Older IRA Owners
                                        The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) was the
                                        source of the legislation permitting certain individuals to make additional contributions to
                                        their IRAs. Individuals aged 50 and older are allowed to make catch-up contributions to
                                        their IRAs above the scheduled maximum annual contribution limit. This will enable them to
                                        save more for retirement. These catch-up payments can go either to a traditional IRA or to a
                                        Roth IRA. Since 2006, that catch-up amount has been $1,000.

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   The exam may require you to know that EGTRRA is responsible for the catch-up
                                                   provisions.
                                        Any taxpayer of any age who reports earned income for a given tax year may contribute to a
                                        traditional IRA. If one spouse has little or no earned income and a joint tax return is filed, a
                                        spousal IRA may be opened for that person and the contribution limits and tax treatment are
                                        the same as for any other IRA.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   12. One spouse of a married couple in their 30s earns an annual salary of $45,000, while
                                                       the other earns $2,000 annually from a home-based business. If they file a joint tax
                                                       return, their maximum IRA contribution for the year is
                                                         A. $6,000.
                                                        B. $8,000.
                                                         C. $12,000.
                                                        D. $14,000.
                                                       Answer: C. When one spouse’s annual earnings are less than $6,000, the spousal IRA
                                                       benefit permits that spouse to contribute the maximum allowable contribution as
                                                       long as a joint return is filed that shows combined income of at least $12,000. In this
                                                       case, their income exceeds that, so they can each have an IRA with a contribution of
                                                       $6,000, making for a total of $12,000. Please note that when using the spousal IRA,
                                                       the higher earning spouse cannot have more than the maximum contributed to their
                                                       account (currently $6,000). One can’t look at this and say the couple has $12,000 to
                                                       be split however they wish. If this question had stated the couple was in their 50s,
                                                       then, because of the catch-up provision, $14,000 would have been the correct choice.


                                        Earnings Limitations for Tax Benefits
                                        As already stated, traditional participants may deduct contributions to their IRAs from their
                                        taxable income. The deductibility limits are reduced or even eliminated for individuals who
                                        are covered by employer-sponsored qualified plans.

                                        These adjusted gross income (AGI) limits increase every year and will not be tested.
                                        Individuals who do not participate in qualified plans may deduct IRA contributions regardless
                                        of income level.

                                 For those filing 2020 tax returns, the IRA deductibility phaseout range is expressed in the
                                 table below.

              Figure 1.1 IRA Phaseout Amounts
                Year   Phaseout Range: Single Filers       Phaseout Range: Joint Filers                                                         Unit 1
                2020         $65,000–$75,000                     $104,000–$124,000

                                 The limits are higher ($196,000–$206,000) if only one of the spouses participates in a
                                 qualified plan, but, as with all of these numbers, it is only the concept that is tested, never the
                                 numbers themselves.

                                 These limits only deal with the deductibility of contributions. If your client earns in excess of
                                 the limits, the full contribution can still be made, but part or none of it can be deducted. The
                                 test refers to those as post-tax or after-tax contributions. The earnings still grow tax-deferred.

                                            EXAMPLE
                                            Two persons who are married, each of whom does not participate in a qualified
                                            plan and whose combined income is $200,000, may contribute and deduct a total
                                            of $12,000 ($14,000 if both individuals are 50 or older). No deduction is allowed for
                                            a married couple where both are covered by a qualified plan and whose combined
                                            income is $124,000 (for 2020) or more. Nevertheless, their contributions are permitted
                                            and all earnings are tax-deferred.


                                 Time for Contributions
                                 IRA contributions for a specific taxable year may be made anytime from January 1 of that
                                 year through the required filing date of that year’s return, (generally April 15 of the next year,
                                 unless the 15th falls on a holiday or weekend). If the individual obtains a filing extension, the
                                 deadline is still April 15.

                                            TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                            The exam may try to trick you into thinking that you can make a contribution later
                                            than April 15 if you have received an extension to file your taxes. You can’t! You should
                                            know that an extension does not give you more time to pay your taxes, it only extends
                                            the time that you have to file your return.


                                 Excess Contributions
                                 Annual IRA contributions exceeding the maximum allowed are subject to a 6% penalty tax
                                 if the excess is not removed by the time the taxpayer files a tax including extensions. Any
                                 earnings during the extension period are taxed, but there is no 6% penalty.


                                 Roth IRAs
                                 The Roth IRA was created as part of the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. Much of what has
                                 been stated about the traditional IRA applies to the Roth IRA—what is important are the
                                 differences. The most significant difference relates to the taxation of contributions and
                                 withdrawals. Contributions to Roth IRAs, unlike those of traditional IRAs, are not tax
                                 deductible. And, earnings are not merely tax-deferred; they can be tax-free.

                                        Earnings accumulated may be withdrawn tax-free, five years following the initial deposit,
                                        provided the
                                         account holder is 59½ or older;
                                         money withdrawn is used for the first-time purchase of a principal residence (up to
                                          $10,000); or
                                         account holder has died or become disabled.
                                        Regular contributions may always be withdrawn tax-free because they are made with
                                        nondeductible contributions.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   13. Among the requirements for accumulated earnings in a Roth IRA to be withdrawn
                                                       free of tax is
                                                         A. the owner of the account is at least 72.
                                                         B. the money is withdrawn for a first-time purchase of a vacation home.
                                                         C. the initial deposit to a Roth IRA was made at least five years ago.
                                                         D. the owner’s spouse is declared disabled.
                                                       Answer: C. The first requirement for tax-free withdrawals from a Roth IRA is that
                                                       the initial deposit to a Roth must have been made at least five years ago. The other
                                                       primary requirement is that the owner must be at least 59½, not 72. If the five-year
                                                       requirement is met, then owners under 59½ can receive distributions of accumulated
                                                       earnings tax-free if they wish to use up to $10,000 for a first-time purchase of a
                                                       primary residence, not a vacation home. The disability requirement only applies to
                                                       the owner of the Roth, not a spouse.


                                        Contribution Limits
                                        Contribution limits to Roth IRAs are the same as those for traditional IRAs, with one
                                        important difference. Just as with a traditional IRA, there are no age limitations as long as the
                                        taxpayer has earned income.

                                        An individual may contribute to both a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA. However, the
                                        maximum combined contribution is $6,000 (or $7,000, if 50 or older).


                                        Eligibility Requirements
                                        Unlike the traditional IRA, there are limits placed on Roth IRA eligibility based on income.
                                        Anyone with earned income is eligible to open a Roth IRA provided the person’s AGI falls
                                        below specified income levels. The following numbers, (which are never tested), are effective
                                        for those filing a tax return for 2020. A single person with an AGI of less than $124,000 may
                                        contribute the full amount to a Roth IRA. The ability to contribute to a Roth IRA is gradually
                                        phased out if the taxpayer’s AGI is between $124,000 and $139,000.

                                        For married taxpayers who file joint tax returns, the AGI limit is $196,000, with the
                                        contribution phased out for couples whose income is between $196,000 and $206,000.

                                        What is AGI?

                      Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)
                      Adjusted gross income, generally referred to as AGI, is computed on the bottom of the first
                      page of your Form 1040. It might help you to take a look at yours. When you do your taxes,
                      you begin by listing all of your earned income (salary, wages, and bonuses) plus other income
                                                                                                                                 Unit 1
                      such as interest and dividends, capital gains, alimony received, and profits from a business you
                      may own. From that total, you deduct certain items to arrive at the AGI. Among the more
                      testable items that are deductible are
                       traditional IRA contribution;
                       alimony paid as part of a pre-January 1, 2019, divorce decree;
                       self-employment tax; and
                       penalties paid on early withdrawal from a savings account.

                                TAKE NOTE
                                These numbers will not be tested because they change every year. It is the concept
                                that is important.

                                TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                Please note that although tax-exempt income from municipal securities is shown on
                                Form 1040, it is not included in AGI.


                      Roth Conversions
                      Anyone with a traditional IRA is permitted to convert it to a Roth IRA. However, there are
                      income tax consequences for doing so. Basically, the entire amount converted is added to the
                      investor's ordinary income. However, as long as the funds are done in a direct rollover trustee
                      to trustee, or, if distributed to the owner, are rolled over within 60 days, there will be no 10%
                      early distribution tax penalty for those under age 59½. If some portion of the contributions
                      to the traditional IRA were made with after-tax money, the IRS uses a proportionate system
                      to determine how much is nontaxable, but that type of computation will not be tested.
                      Conversions may also be done from any qualified employer plan such as 401(k) and 403(b)
                      plans.


                      Key Points to Remember About the Roth IRA
                       Contributions are not tax deductible.
                       Distributions are tax-free if taken after age 59½ and a Roth account has been open for at
                        least five years.
                       Contributions can be made at any age as long as there is earned income.
                       Distributions are not required to begin at age 72.
                       If because of death, disability, or first-time home purchase, the distribution is qualified
                        and not subject to tax or the 10% penalty.
                       As with all IRAs, there must be a named beneficiary (who can be a minor).
                       The contributions (all made with after-tax money) may always be withdrawn without tax
                        or penalty. It is only the earnings where the five years/age 59½ rules apply to avoid tax
                        and penalties.

                                        Let’s make sure you know your IRAs:

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   14. The main difference between a traditional IRA and a Roth IRA is
                                                        A. the traditional IRA is funded with after-tax dollars and the Roth IRA is funded
                                                            with pretax dollars.
                                                        B. the Roth IRA has higher contribution limits.
                                                        C. if meeting the requirements, distributions from a Roth IRA are tax-free, while
                                                            distributions from traditional IRAs are taxed as ordinary income.
                                                        D. if the individual has too much AGI, contributions to a traditional IRA are not
                                                            allowed; no such limitation exists for Roth IRAs.
                                                        Answer: C. The beauty of the Roth IRA is, if the conditions are met, they are tax-free.
                                                        The contribution is funded with pretax funds for the traditional IRA. Contribution
                                                        limits are the same and it is the Roth IRA where the ability to contribute phases out
                                                        once the AGI gets over a certain limit.


                                        Withdrawals From Traditional IRAs
                                        Up until this point, we've discussed contributions; now let's look at taking the money out.
                                        When it comes to traditional IRAs, distributions without penalty may begin after age 59½
                                        and must begin by April 1 of the year following the year an individual turns 72. Distributions
                                        before age 59½ may be subject to a tax penalty, and withdrawals less than the required
                                        minimum distributions (RMDs), after age 72 may also incur tax penalties.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   When is the deadline for receiving a RMD from an IRA? An account owner must take
                                                   the first RMD for the year in which the account owner turns 72. However, the first
                                                   RMD payment can be delayed until April 1 of the year following the year in which the
                                                   account owner turns 72. For all subsequent years, including the year in which the first
                                                   RMD was paid by April 1, the account owner must take the RMD by December 31 of the
                                                   year.
                                        To the extent withdrawals are from tax-deductible contributions, they are taxable as ordinary
                                        income. When there are both deductible and nondeductible contributions, a formula is used
                                        whereby a portion of the withdrawal represents a nontaxable return of principal.

                                        Taxable withdrawals before age 59½ are also subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty unless
                                        they are because of
                                         death;
                                         disability;
                                         first-time purchase of a primary residence ($10,000 lifetime maximum);
                                         qualified higher education expenses for immediate family members (including
                                          grandchildren, but not nieces or nephews); or
                                         certain medical expenses in excess of an AGI limit.
                                        These exceptions also apply in the case of a nonqualified (taxable) distribution from a Roth
                                        IRA.

                                PRACTICE QUESTION
                                15. Who of the following will not incur a penalty on an IRA withdrawal?
                                     A. Man who has just become totally disabled
                                     B. Woman who turned 59 a month before the withdrawal

                                                                                                                                       Unit 1
                                     C. Woman, age 50, who decides on early retirement
                                     D. Man in his early 40s who uses the money to buy a second home
                                    Answer: A. Early withdrawals, without penalty, are permitted only in certain
                                    situations (such as death or qualifying disability).

                      As stated, withdrawals must begin by April 1 of the year following the year in which the
                      account owner reaches age 72, and they must meet minimum Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
                      distribution requirements or incur a 50% penalty on the amounts falling short of the RMD.

                      One important way the Roth IRA differs from other retirement plans is that the age 72 is
                      irrelevant. There are no RMDs and the account will continue to grow tax-free until the holder
                      decides to take it out.

                      There is one other way to tap your IRA before age 59½ without penalty—through the
                      substantially equal periodic payment exception. The substantially equal periodic payment
                      exception under IRS rule 72(t) states that if you receive IRA payments at least annually
                      based on your life expectancy (or the joint life expectancies of you and your beneficiary),
                      the withdrawals are not subject to the 10% penalty. The IRS has tables for determining the
                      appropriate amount of each payment at any given age.

                                TAKE NOTE
                                For exam purposes, you can postpone beginning distributions until the later of
                                   April 1 of the calendar year after you turn age 72 or
                                   April 1 of the calendar year following your retirement (but only for qualified plans,
                                    not an IRA).

                                EXAMPLE
                                An IRA owner who reaches age 72 on January 1, 2020, must begin withdrawals by
                                April 1, 2021. However, if this individual is covered by an employer-sponsored plan,
                                there are no RMDs from that plan (but there are from any traditional IRAs) until after
                                retirement.


                      Nondeductible Capital Withdrawals
                      IRA investors who contribute after-tax dollars to an IRA are not taxed on those funds when
                      they are withdrawn from the account, but taxpayers are taxed at the ordinary income tax rate
                      when they withdraw funds resulting from investment gains or income. As stated previously,
                      if the client is in the middle part of the phaseout range resulting in some of the contribution
                      being pretax (deductible) and the rest post-tax, the IRS has a formula to determine how much
                      of the money withdrawn is nontaxable.

                                EXAMPLE
                                A client has invested $25,000 in after-tax dollars in an IRA currently worth $75,000. If
                                the client were to withdraw $75,000, only $50,000 would be taxable.

                                                     The early withdrawal penalties for all IRAs are waived in the event of death or
                                                     disability.

                                                     TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                     Assume questions are about traditional IRAs unless they specifically state otherwise.

                                                     TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                     Income and capital gains earned from investments in any IRA account are not taxed
                                                     until the funds are withdrawn and, if a qualified withdrawal, are not taxed at all in the
                                                     case of a Roth.


                                        IRA Investments
                                        Funds in an IRA account may be used to buy stocks, bonds, mutual funds, unit investment
                                        trusts (UITs), limited partnerships, REITS, U.S. government securities, and gold or silver
                                        coins minted by the U.S. Treasury Department (American Eagles), as well as certain platinum
                                        coins and certain gold, silver, palladium, and platinum bullion, annuities, and many other
                                        investments.

                                        IRA investments should be relatively conservative and should reflect the investor’s age and risk
                                        tolerance profile. Because an IRA serves as a source of retirement funds, it is important that
                                        the account be managed for adequate long-term growth.


                                        Ineligible and Inappropriate Investments
                                        Collectibles, including antiques, gems, rare coins, works of art, and stamps, are not acceptable
                                        IRA investments. Life insurance contracts (such as whole life and term) may not be purchased
                                        in an IRA. Tax-free municipal bonds, municipal bond funds, and municipal bond UITs are
                                        eligible, but generally considered inappropriate for an IRA (or any tax-qualified plan) because
                                        their yields are typically lower than those of other similar investments, and the income
                                        generated is taxable on withdrawal from the IRA.


                                        Ineligible Investment Practices
                                        No margin account trading, including short sales, is permitted in an IRA or any qualified
                                        retirement plan. The same is true for speculative options strategies such as uncovered (naked)
                                        puts and calls. Covered call writing and buying puts and calls is allowed (more on those in
                                        Unit 10).

                                     A. investment company securities.
                                     B. corporate stocks and bonds.

                      Moving IRAs
                      Individuals may move their funds and investments from one IRA to another IRA through one
                      of three methods:
                       60-day rollover
                       Direct rollover
                       Trustee to trustee transfer


                      60-Day Rollovers
                      If you see IRA rollover, it will be the 60-day rollover. An IRA account owner may take
                      temporary possession of the account funds to move the retirement account to another
                      custodian. The account owner may do so only once per 12-month period, and the rollover
                      must be completed within 60 calendar days of the funds’ withdrawal from the original plan.
                      However, 100% of the withdrawn amount must be rolled into the new account, or the
                      unrolled balance will be subject to income tax and, if applicable, early withdrawal penalty.

                      A participant in an employer-sponsored qualified plan may move her plan assets to a rollover
                      IRA if he leaves the company and elects to take a lump-sum distribution. If the participant
                      does take possession of the funds, he must complete the rollover within 60 calendar days of
                      withdrawing the funds from the qualified plan.
                      When the participant takes possession of the funds from a qualified plan to make a rollover,
                      the payor of the distribution must, by law, withhold 20% of the distribution as a withholding
                      tax. The participant must, nonetheless, roll over 100% of the plan distribution, including the
                      funds withheld, or be subject to income tax and, if applicable, an early withdrawal penalty.

                                EXAMPLE
                                A 50-year-old individual with $100,000 in her company retirement plan changes
                                employers. Her pension plan may be distributed to her in a lump-sum payment,
                                minus the mandatory 20% withholding of $20,000. She must then deposit $100,000
                                in an IRA rollover account within 60 days. Any portion not rolled over, including the
                                $20,000 withheld, is considered a distribution subject to ordinary income tax and early
                                distribution penalty. If she deposits the entire $100,000 into the IRA, she will apply on
                                her next income tax return for a refund of the $20,000 withheld.


                      Direct Rollovers From Retirement Plans to IRAs
                      A direct rollover is a distribution from an employer-sponsored retirement plan to an IRA,
                      either traditional or Roth. When you terminate employment (or retire), you have the option
                      of moving your employer-sponsored plan assets to an IRA. In some cases, if you go to a new




Series_7_2E.indb 31                                                                                                     11/19/2021 7:52:15 PM

                                        job, your new employer’s plan may permit a direct rollover into the plan. The key to a direct
                                        rollover is that the money is never seen by the employee and moves directly from the current
                                        plan administrator directly to another administrator.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   There is a specific type of traditional IRA known as a rollover IRA. When a participant in
                                                   an employer-sponsored qualified retirement plan (we’ll cover those shortly) separates
                                                   from the employer—whether through retirement or termination—vested assets in
                                                   the company sponsored plan may be directly transferred to a separate IRA titled
                                                   as a rollover IRA. There is a benefit to doing this. Because these assets have been
                                                   segregated as having come from a qualified plan, should the individual obtain future
                                                   employment and wish to have those assets transferred to the new employer’s plan, it
                                                   is a simple task to do so.


                                        Trustee to Trustee Transfers
                                        Sometimes simply referred to as an IRA transfer, trustee to trustee transfers are when account
                                        assets are sent directly from one IRA custodian to another, and the account owner never takes
                                        possession of the funds. Unlike the one per 12 months maximum with an IRA rollover, the
                                        number of IRA transfers an account owner may make per year is unlimited. Direct rollovers
                                        and transfers generally make better sense than 60-day rollovers because the 20% federal tax
                                        withholding does not apply to direct transfers of portfolios, and because there is no specified
                                        time limit, you don’t have to rush to meet the 60-day requirement.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   How does a direct rollover differ from a transfer? A direct rollover is different from a
                                                   transfer because it involves two different types of plans. For example, one would use a
                                                   direct rollover to move funds from a 401(k) plan to an IRA while the transfer is from an
                                                   IRA at one brokerage firm to an IRA at another.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   17. How often can an IRA be rolled over to another IRA?
                                                        A. Once every 60 days
                                                        B. Once every 90 days
                                                        C. Once every 12 months
                                                        D. There are no limits on how often a rollover can occur
                                                       Answer: C. An IRA can be rolled over to another IRA once every 12 months. It is the
                                                       transfers from trustee to trustee where there is no limit. Unless the question says
                                                       direct rollover, or indicates that it is from a qualified plan to an IRA, rollover always
                                                       refers to the 60-day type.


                                        Education IRA
                                        In addition to the Roth IRA, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 also created Education IRAs
                                        with a $500 annual contribution limit. In 2002, these were renamed Coverdell ESAs and
                                        the annual contribution limit is now $2,000. ESAs allow after-tax contributions for student
                                        beneficiaries. Contributions must be made in cash and must be made on or before the date on
                                        which the beneficiary attains age 18, unless the beneficiary is a special needs beneficiary—
                                        an individual who because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition requires additional
                                        time to complete his education. Coverdell ESAs fund educational expenses of a designated

                                      beneficiary by allowing after-tax (nondeductible) contributions to accumulate on a tax-
                                      deferred basis.

                                      When distributions are made from a Coverdell ESA, the earnings portion of the distribution
                                      is excluded from income when it is used to pay qualified education expenses. Withdrawn
                                      earnings are taxed to the recipient (beneficiary) and are subject to a 10% tax penalty when                   Unit 1
                                      they are not used to pay qualified education expenses.

                                                 TAKE NOTE
                                                 If the money is not used by a beneficiary’s 30th birthday (except for a special needs
                                                 beneficiary), it must be distributed and the earnings are subject to ordinary income
                                                 taxes and a 10% penalty.
                                      In addition to qualified higher education expenses (postsecondary education), the account
                                      can also be used for elementary and secondary education expenses and for public, private, or
                                      religious schools.

                                      The contribution to a Coverdell ESA may be limited, depending on the amount of AGI and
                                      filing status.

                                                 TAKE NOTE
                                                 There is nothing to prevent more than one individual from contributing to a Coverdell
                                                 ESA; the annual limit applies to each beneficiary. Parents and grandparents can
                                                 contribute to a single account, as long as the $2,000 limit per child is not exceeded in
                                                 any given year.
                                      Other features of the ESA include
                                       provisions that allow contributions to continue past age 18 for beneficiaries with special
                                        needs and
                                       allowing Coverdell ESA contributions, for any year, to be made up to April 15 of the
                                        following year (just like contributions to your IRA).

                                      Here are some key test points about Coverdell ESAs:
                                       Contributions can be made by parents and other adults; the total for one child is still $2,000.
                                       Contribution limit is $2,000 per year per child until the child’s 18th birthday.
                                       Contributions are not tax deductible, but all earnings are tax-deferred.
                                       Distributions are tax-free if they are taken before age 30 and used for eligible education
                                        expenses.
                                       If the accumulated value in the account is not used by age 30, the funds must be
                                        distributed and subject to income tax and a 10% penalty on the earnings or rolled over
                                        into a different Coverdell ESA for another family member. Their definition of family is
                                        extremely broad and, in addition to the obvious, includes cousins, aunts and uncles, and
                                        even in-laws.

           LESSON 1.8: EMPLOYER-SPONSORED RETIREMENT PLANS

                                        retirement plans.



                                        Tax-Sheltered Annuities (403(b) Plans)
                                        Employer-sponsored retirement plans come in all different shapes and colors. First we will
                                        describe the most common plan for those employed by the public school system. This
                                        plan, the 403(b) plan (that is the section of the IRC), is also available to many nonprofit
                                        organizations operating under section 501(c)(3) of the Code.

                                        Tax-sheltered annuities (TSAs) offered through 403(b) plans are available to employees of
                                         public educational institutions;
                                         tax-exempt organizations (501(c)(3) organizations); and
                                         religious organizations.
                                        Qualified employees may exclude contributions from their taxable incomes provided
                                        they do not exceed limits. Qualified annuity plans offered under Section 403(b) of the
                                        IRC, sometimes referred to as tax-sheltered annuities (TSAs), are intended to encourage
                                        retirement savings. To ensure this objective, 403(b) plans, (like IRAs and other retirement
                                        plans), are subject to tax penalties if savings are withdrawn before a participant reaches age
                                        59½.

                                        In general, the clergy and employees of charitable institutions, private hospitals, colleges
                                        and universities, elementary and secondary schools, and zoos and museums are eligible to
                                        participate if they are at least 21 years old and have completed one year of service.
                                        TSAs are funded by elective employee deferrals. The deferred amount is excluded from the
                                        employee’s gross income, and earnings accumulate tax-free until distribution. A written
                                        salary reduction agreement must be executed between the employer and the employee. An
                                        employer can make contributions to a 403(b) solely on behalf of the covered employee or in
                                        conjunction with an employee deferral.

                                        As with other qualified plans, distributions are 100% taxable, and a 10% penalty is applied to
                                        distributions before age 59½.

                                                   You might see a question that asks if a student can be a participant in an educational
                                                   institution’s TSA. The answer is no, because the plan is only available to employees.

                      Investments
                      Historically, these plans were (and still are) referred to as TSAs because annuities were the only
                      investment option. In 1974, a provision was made to permit the purchase of mutual funds as
                      well, although it is estimated that more than 85% of all 403(b) money is invested in either
                      fixed or variable annuities.

                                PRACTICE QUESTION
                                19. A retirement plan that allows the employee to make pretax contributions (within
                                    certain limits), provides for tax deferral of earnings, and is available for employees of
                                    public school systems and certain tax-exempt organizations is
                                     A. a 403(b) plan.
                                     B. a 401(k) plan.
                                     C. an SEP IRA.
                                     D. a payroll deduction plan.
                                     Answer: A. The giveaway here is the public school employees—the 403(b). That is
                                     their plan as well as being offered to employees of certain, but not all, tax-exempt
                                     organizations.


                      Section 457 Plans
                      A Section 457(b) plan is a deferred compensation plan set up under Section 457 of the tax
                      code that may be used by employees of a state, political subdivision of a state, and any agency
                      or instrumentality of a state. This plan may also be offered to employees of certain tax-exempt
                      organizations (hospitals, charitable organizations, unions, and so forth, but not churches).

                      Even though technically a nonqualified plan, employees can defer compensation in a 457
                      plan, and the amount deferred is not reportable for tax purposes. Therefore, the employee
                      receives a deduction each year for the amount deferred.

                      There are several important facts to know about 457 plans:
                       These plans are exempt from ERISA—nongovernmental plans must be unfunded to
                        qualify for tax benefits, while government plans must be funded.
                       These plans are generally not required to follow the nondiscrimination rules of other
                        retirement plans.
                       Plans for tax-exempt organizations are limited to covering only highly compensated
                        employees, while any employee (or even independent contractor) of a governmental entity
                        may participate.
                       Distributions from 457(b) plans of nongovernmental tax-exempt employees may not be
                        rolled over into an IRA, but there is no 10% penalty for early withdrawal.
                       It is possible to maintain both a 457 and 403(b), or a 457 and 401(k) and make
                        maximum contributions to both. You could also have an IRA along with the 457.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTIONS
                                                   20. A basic difference between a Section 457 plan established on behalf of a
                                                       governmental entity and one established by a private tax-exempt organization is that
                                                        A. a governmental plan must hold its assets in trust or custodial accounts for the
                                                            benefit of individual participants.
                                                        B. a tax-exempt plan participant does not have to include plan distributions in
                                                            her taxable income.
                                                        C. a governmental plan cannot make a distribution before the participant attains
                                                            age 70½.
                                                        D. a tax-exempt plan’s distributions are not eligible for a favorable lump-sum 10-
                                                            year averaging treatment.
                                                       Answer: A. A governmental Section 457 plan must be funded—that is—it must hold
                                                       plan assets in trusts or custodial accounts for the benefit of individual participants.
                                                       Conversely, a tax-exempt (nongovernmental) Section 457 plan may not be funded.

                                                            municipalities.
                                                        B. will distribute money to participants, but only the earnings will be taxed.
                                                        C. is a type of qualified plan.
                                                        D. allows employees to defer up to 50% of income within the plan.
                                                       Answer: A. A 457 plan is a type of deferred compensation plan for employees of
                                                       state and local municipalities.


                                        Corporate-Sponsored Retirement Plans
                                        In this section, we will be discussing qualified plans sponsored by corporations. These include
                                        pension plans, profit-sharing plans, and the highly popular 401(k) plans.

                                        The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) is federal legislation that
                                        regulates the establishment and management of corporate pension or retirement plans, also
                                        known as private-sector plans.

                                        All qualified corporate plans must be established under a trust agreement. A trustee is
                                        appointed for each plan and has a fiduciary responsibility for the plan and the beneficial
                                        owners (the plan holders). We’ll cover ERISA in greater detail later in this unit.


                                        Defined Contribution and Defined Benefit Plans
                                        All qualified retirement plans fall into one of two categories. Those that offer no specific end
                                        result, but, instead focus on current, tax-deductible contributions, are defined contribution
                                        plans. Those that promise a specific retirement benefit but do not specify the level of current
                                        contributions are defined benefit plans. It is important to distinguish between these two
                                        approaches.


                                        Defined Contribution Plans
                                        Defined contribution plans include money purchase pension plans as well as profit-sharing
                                        plans and 401(k) plans. As with other business plans (as compared to an IRA), the maximum
                                        employer contribution is significantly greater.

                      Defined contribution plan participants’ funds accumulate until a future event—generally
                      retirement— when the funds may be withdrawn. The ultimate account value depends on the
                      total amount contributed, along with interest and capital gains from the plan investments.
                      In this type of plan, the plan participant assumes the investment risk. Examples of defined
                      contribution plans include profit-sharing plans, 401(k) plans, and money purchase pension
                      plans.                                                                                                      Unit 1


                      Defined Benefit Plans
                      Defined benefit plans are designed to provide specific retirement benefits for participants,
                      such as fixed monthly income. Regardless of investment performance, the promised benefit
                      is paid under the contract terms. A defined benefit plan sponsor assumes the investment risk.
                      The benefit is usually determined by a formula that takes into account years of service and
                      average salary for the last five years before retirement. Older, highly compensated employees
                      are likely to have the largest annual contributions on their behalf. Because of the expenses and
                      complexities involved (the plan’s annual return must be signed by an actuary), only 4% of
                      workers had defined benefit plans in 2018, whereas in 1979, that number was 28%.

                                TAKE NOTE
                                Because of the actuarial assumptions and computations, the amount of the annual
                                contributions to the plan has to be figured by an actuary.


                      Contributory vs. Noncontributory Plans
                      In a contributory plan, both the employer and employee make contributions to the account.
                      In a noncontributory plan, only the employer makes the contributions. Probably the most
                      common example of a contributory plan is the 401(k) plan, where the employee determines
                      how much to contribute and the employer may match it up to a certain percentage.


                      Employer Deductions
                      The employer can usually deduct—subject to limits—contributions made to a qualified plan.
                      The deduction limit for those contributions to a qualified plan depends on the kind of plan in
                      place.

                                TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                Unlike an annuity payout or life insurance premium, contributions to a defined benefit
                                plan are not affected by the participant’s sex.

                                TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                Employer contributions to defined benefit or defined contribution (money purchase)
                                pension plans are mandatory. Although profit-sharing plans and 401(k) plans are
                                technically defined contribution plans, they are not pension plans, and employer
                                contributions are not mandatory. In all cases, allowable employer contributions are
                                100% deductible to the corporation. There is no tax obligation to the employee until
                                withdrawal.

                                        Profit-Sharing Plans
                                        A profit-sharing plan established by an employer allows employees to participate in the
                                        business’s profits.

                                        Profit-sharing plans need not have a predetermined contribution formula. Plans that do
                                        include such a formula generally express contributions as a fixed percentage of profits.
                                        In either event, to be qualified, a profit-sharing plan must have substantial and recurring
                                        contributions, according to the IRC.

                                        Profit-sharing plans are popular because they offer employers the greatest amount of
                                        contribution flexibility. The ability to skip contributions during years of low profits appeals to
                                        corporations with unpredictable cash flows. They are also relatively easy to install, administer,
                                        and communicate to employees.


                                        401(k) Plans
                                        In a 401(k) plan, an employee directs an employer to deduct a percentage of the employee’s
                                        salary to contribute to a retirement account. 401(k) plans permit an employer to make
                                        matching contributions up to a set percentage of the employee-directed contributions, making
                                        this a type of defined contribution plan. All contributions are made with pretax dollars. In
                                        effect, participating employees are reducing their salary by the amount of their contribution
                                        and, therefore, their W-2 will show the actual salary less the 401(k) contribution.

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   One of the benefits of investing through a 401(k) plan is that it takes advantage of
                                                   dollar cost averaging, a technique described in Unit 8, which always results in a lower
                                                   cost per share in a fluctuating market.


                                        Roth 401(k) Plans
                                        The Roth 401(k) plan is an option available to an existing 401(k) plan. This option combines
                                        features of Roth IRAs and 401(k) retirement plans. Just as with a Roth IRA, these plans
                                        require after-tax contributions but allow tax-free withdrawals, provided the retiring person is
                                        at least 59½ years old at the time of the withdrawal. Once again, paralleling the Roth IRA,
                                        the account must be at least five years old to take tax-free withdrawals.

                                        Like a regular 401(k) plan, it has employer-matching contributions; however, the employer’s
                                        match must be deposited into a regular 401(k) plan and be fully taxable upon withdrawal.
                                        Thus, the employee must have two accounts: a regular 401(k) and a Roth 401(k). Employees
                                        may contribute to either account but may not transfer money between accounts once the
                                        money has been contributed.

                                        Unlike Roth IRAs, Roth 401(k) plans have no income limit restriction on who may
                                        participate. One may have both a Roth 401(k) plan and a Roth IRA, but the income limits
                                        would still apply to the Roth IRA. Unlike Roth IRAs, Roth 401(k) plans require withdrawals
                                        to begin no later than age 72, following the same rules that apply to all RMDs.


                                        Required Beginning Date
                                        We have already covered the age at which minimum distributions must begin for IRAs. We
                                        just mentioned that Roth 401(k) plans have the same 72 rule. What about in the case of all

                      qualified corporate plans? The term used here is required beginning date. A participant must
                      begin to receive distributions from her qualified retirement plan by April 1 of the later of the
                      following years:
                       The first year after the calendar year in which she reaches age 72.
                       The first year after the calendar year in which she retires from employment with the                     Unit 1
                        employer maintaining the plan.
                       In other words, if you are still working for that employer and are over 72, minimum
                        distributions are not required until after you retire.


                      Additional Corporate Plans
                      Here are some other corporate-sponsored plans, but these are less likely to be tested subjects
                      on your exam.


                      Simplified Employee Pension (SEP-IRA)
                      SEP plans are qualified individual retirement plans that offer self-employed persons and small
                      businesses easy-to-administer pension plans. SEPs allow employers to contribute money to
                      SEP IRAs that their employees set up to receive employer contributions.

                      Under IRS rules, an eligible employee is an individual (including a self-employed individual)
                      who meets all the following requirements:
                       Has reached age 21
                       Has worked for the employer in at least 3 of the last 5 years
                       Has received at least $600 in compensation from the employer during the year (for 2020)
                      Self-employed individuals may contribute up to a maximum amount each year to an SEP
                      IRA for themselves or employees. Catch-up contributions are generally not allowed for the
                      self-employed person. However, if an employee is enrolled in an SEP and the SEP permits
                      non-SEP IRA contributions to be made to the SEP account, they may also make additional
                      catch-up contributions to the SEP account if they are age 50 or older.

                      Generally, an employer can take an income tax deduction for contributions made each year to
                      each employee’s SEP. Also, the amounts contributed to an SEP by an employer on behalf of an
                      employee are excludable from the employee’s gross income.


                      Savings Incentive Match Plans for Employees (SIMPLEs)
                      SIMPLE plans are retirement plans for businesses with 100 or fewer employees who earned
                      $5,000 or more during the preceding calendar year. In addition, the business cannot currently
                      have another retirement plan in place.

                      The employee makes pretax contributions into a SIMPLE up to an annual contribution limit.
                      The employer makes matching contributions. Matching contribution requirements and limits
                      for employers are specified by the IRS and include catch-up contributions up to $3,000 for
                      those age 50 and older. SIMPLE plans require immediate vesting.

                      For a small business wanting to have an inexpensive retirement plan for their employees, the
                      SIMPLE is the way to go.

                                        Keogh Plans
                                        Keogh plans are retirement plans for self-employed people. They were formerly referred to as
                                        H.R. 10 plans after the law that first allowed unincorporated businesses to sponsor retirement
                                        plans. Because the law no longer distinguishes between corporate and other plan sponsors, the
                                        term is seldom used. However, you may still see it on your exam.


                                        Stock Purchase Plans and Stock Options
                                        Some publicly traded companies offer their employees the ability to purchase company stock.
                                        There are several ways this can be done, but perhaps the most straightforward method of
                                        employee stock ownership can be found in an employee stock purchase program (ESPP).
                                        These plans provide a convenient method for employees to purchase company shares.

                                        Employee stock purchase plans are essentially a type of payroll deduction plan that allows
                                        employees to buy company stock without affecting the transactions themselves. Money is
                                        automatically taken out of a participant’s paycheck on an after-tax basis every pay period and
                                        accrues in an escrow account until it is used to buy company shares on a periodic basis, such
                                        as every six months. These plans are similar to other types of stock option plans in that they
                                        promote employee ownership of the company but do not have many of the restrictions that
                                        come with more formal stock option arrangements. Plus, they are designed to be somewhat
                                        more liquid in nature.

                                        Here are the basics:
                                         Contributions should be 1%–10% of salary. The contribution is a payroll deduction. This
                                          is calculated on pretax salary but taken after tax (unlike with a 401(k), there is no tax
                                          deduction on ESPP contributions).
                                         At the end of a purchase period, usually every six months, the employer will purchase
                                          company stock for participants using contributions during the purchase period. There
                                          will be a discount on the purchase price. The employer takes the price of the company
                                          stock at the beginning of the purchase period and the price at the end of the purchase
                                          period, whichever is lower, and then gives a discount from that price.
                                         Participants can sell the purchased stock right away or hold on to the stocks longer for
                                          preferential tax treatment.

                                        An employer may also offer stock options that give an employee the right to purchase a
                                        specified number of shares of the employer’s common stock at a stated price over a stated time
                                        period. Unlike qualified retirement plans, there are no nondiscrimination requirements for
                                        these plans. For publicly traded stock, the strike price (also called the grant or exercise price)
                                        is usually the market price of the stock at the time the option is granted. In most cases, there
                                        is a minimum time the employee must remain with the company to be able to use the option
                                        (the vesting period). The hope of the employee is that the market price of the employer’s stock
                                        will increase in value. Then, the employee will be able to purchase the stock by exercising the
                                        option (purchasing the stock) at the lower strike price and then sell the stock at the current
                                        market price. These are available only to employees of the issuing company. Most states
                                        require that the stock option plan be approved by the board of directors. Please note that these
                                        are not the same as the put and call options we will be covering at length in Unit 10.

                                        We’ve covered a lot of material so here is your chance to see how well you understand.

                      PRACTICE QUESTIONS
                      22. All of the following statements regarding RMDs from a 401(k) are true except
                           A. minimum required distributions begin by April 1 of the year following the year
                                 in which the participant turns 72.

                                                                                                                          Unit 1
                           B. RMDs are not required if the participant is still working for that employer.
                           C. RMDs not taken are subject to a 50% penalty.
                           D. RMDs taken after age 72 are taxed at a more favorable long-term capital gains
                                 rate.
                          Answer: D. Minimum required distributions taken after age 72 are taxed, as are all
                          taxable distributions from retirement accounts, such as ordinary income.

                      23. One of the most important characteristics of a profit-sharing plan is that
                           A. the employer is not required to make a contribution if the company has no
                               profits.
                           B. it favors older employees.
                           C. the employer may choose who participates and who doesn’t.
                           D. contributions are made with after-tax dollars and therefore only the growth is
                               taxed at distribution.
                          Answer: A. One of the most important characteristics of a profit-sharing plan is the
                          employer is not required to make a contribution if the company has no profits.

                      24. A type of payroll deduction plan that allows employees to purchase the company
                          stock at a discount from the purchase price is called
                            A. a preemptive right.
                            B. an employee stock purchase plan.
                            C. a profit-sharing plan.
                           D. a money purchase plan.
                          Answer: B. A type of payroll deduction plan that allows employees to purchase the
                          company stock at a discount from the purchase price is called an employee stock
                          purchase plan. A preemptive right does permit the purchase of stock at a discount,
                          but is offered to existing shareholders, not employees.

                      25. A married 75-year-old employee, whose spouse is 55, works for a manufacturing firm
                          and has $1 million in the firm’s 401(k) plan. What is accurate regarding the RMD from
                          the 401(k) at this point in time?
                            A. RMDs should have begun by April 1 of the year following the year in which the
                                participant turned 72.
                           B. There is no required RMD at this time because the spouse is under age 59½.
                           C. RMDs will begin after the employee retires.
                           D. Any RMDs not taken at this time are subject to income taxes plus a 10%
                                penalty.
                          Answer: C. A participant is not required to take minimum distributions from the
                          employer’s 401(k) while still working. After retirement starts, RMDs from a qualified
                          retirement plan must begin by April 1 of the first year after the calendar year in which
                          the plan participant retires from employment with the employer maintaining the
                          plan.

           LESSON 1.9: ERISA
                                        LO 1.i Define ERISA and its application to private-sector retirement plans.



                                        Testable ERISA Provisions
                                        ERISA was established to prevent abuse and misuse of pension funds. ERISA guidelines apply
                                        to private-sector (corporate) retirement plans and certain union plans—not public plans like
                                        those for government workers. Significant ERISA provisions include the following:
                                         Participation. This identifies eligibility rules for employees. All employees must be
                                          covered if they are 21 years or older and have performed one year of full-time service,
                                          which ERISA defines as 1,000 hours or more.
                                         Funding. Funds contributed to the plan must be segregated from other corporate assets.
                                          Plan trustees must administer and invest the assets prudently and in the best interest of all
                                          participants. IRS contribution limits must be observed.
                                         Vesting. Vesting defines when an employer contribution to a plan becomes the employee’s
                                          money, such as an employer-matching contribution to a 401(k) plan. ERISA limits
                                          how long the vesting schedule can last before the employee is fully vested. Note that an
                                          employee is always fully vested in the employee’s own contributions to a plan.
                                         Communication. The plan document must be in writing, and employees must be given
                                          annual statements of account and updates of plan benefits.
                                         Nondiscrimination. All eligible employees must be treated impartially through a
                                          uniformly applied formula.
                                         Beneficiaries. Beneficiaries must be named to receive an employee’s benefits at death.

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   You may see a question that asks for the type of plans that ERISA regulates. ERISA
                                                   applies to private-sector plans (corporate) only. It does not apply to plans for federal
                                                   or state government workers (public sector plans), nor is it applicable to nonqualified
                                                   plans.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTIONS
                                                   26. ERISA rules and regulations include all of the following except
                                                        A. ERISA protects participants in private-sector retirement plans such as a
                                                            pension from the creditors of the corporation.
                                                        B. a retirement plan covered by ERISA may not discriminate against who is
                                                            eligible to participate in the plan.
                                                        C. it defines when employer contributions become the employee’s money.
                                                        D. ERISA allows the corporation to be the beneficiary of plan benefits for
                                                            employees before their retirement.
                                                       Answer: D. ERISA does not allow the corporation to be the beneficiary of plan
                                                       benefits for employees before their retirement.

                                     A. A defined benefit plan offered by a manufacturing company to employees
                                     B. A pension plan offered to employees of the City of Detroit, Michigan
                                     C. A deferred compensation plan offered to select employees of a CPA firm
                                     D. A 457 plan
                                    Answer: A. A defined benefit plan offered by a manufacturing company to                      Unit 1
                                    employees is covered by ERISA. Only private-sector plans are covered by ERISA, not
                                    state or local government plans (public sector plans).


                      LO 1.j Recall when health savings accounts (HSAs) may be used.

                      A health savings account (HSA) is a tax-exempt trust or custodial account individuals can set
                      up with a qualified HSA trustee to pay or reimburse certain medical expenses they incur.


                      Benefits of an HSA
                       You can claim a tax deduction for contributions you, or someone other than your
                        employer, make to your HSA even if you do not itemize your deductions on Form 1040.
                       Contributions to your HSA made by your employer (including contributions made
                        through a cafeteria plan) may be excluded from your gross income.
                       The contributions remain in your account until you use them.
                       The interest or other earnings on the assets in the account are tax free.
                       Distributions may be tax free if you pay qualified medical expenses.
                       An HSA is portable. It stays with you if you change employers or leave the work force.


                      Eligibility for an HSA
                      To be an eligible individual and qualify for an HSA, you must meet the following
                      requirements:
                       You must be covered under a high deductible health plan (HDHP), on the first day of
                        the month. That means you are considered to be an eligible individual for the entire
                        year if you are an eligible individual on the first day of the last month of your tax year
                        (December 1 for most taxpayers).
                       You have no other health coverage except what is permitted under the rules.
                       You are not enrolled in Medicare.
                       You cannot be claimed as a dependent on someone else’s tax return.
                       Each spouse who is an eligible individual who wants an HSA must open a separate HSA.
                        You cannot have a joint HSA.


                      High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP)
                      An HDHP has:
                       a higher annual deductible than typical health plans; and
                       a maximum limit on the sum of the annual deductible and out-of-pocket medical
                        expenses that you must pay for covered expenses. Out-of-pocket expenses include
                        copayments and other amounts, but do not include premiums.

                                       Contributions to an HSA
                                       Any eligible individual can contribute to an HSA. For an employee’s HSA, the employee,
                                       the employee’s employer, or both may contribute to the employee’s HSA in the same year.
                                       For an HSA established by a self-employed (or unemployed) individual, the individual can
                                       contribute. Family members or any other person may also make contributions on behalf of
                                       an eligible individual. Contributions to an HSA must be made in cash, but, the law permits
                                       investments to be made into stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Contributions of stock or
                                       property are not allowed. There is a limit on the amount that may be contributed, but,
                                       because it is a number that changes each year, it will not be tested. The only facts that could
                                       be important are that the contribution for those with family coverage is higher (logically) than
                                       that for self-only coverage and that the amount the individual may contribute is reduced by
                                       any amounts contributed by the employer.

                                                  TAKE NOTE
                                                  Do not confuse an HSA with an FSA (flexible spending account). The FSA account holds
                                                  money deducted from the employee’s pay and remains with the company—it is not
                                                  investible, and, if you don’t use it, you lose it.

                                                       C. the individual must have an HDHP.
                                                       D. if married, you must have a joint HSA.
                                                      Answer: C. In order to be eligible for a health savings plan, an individual must be
                                                      enrolled in a high deductible health plan (HDHP). Health savings accounts (HSAs)

              INTRODUCTION
                         The key to suitability is found in the know your customer rule (KYC). This rule, FINRA
                         2090, places an obligation on the member firm and associated persons to request information
                         from customers. Customers are not required to provide all information asked. The KYC rule
                         provides some flexibility when information is unavailable because the customer refused to
                         supply it.

                         In this case, when some customer information is unavailable, despite a firm’s request for it,
                         limits are placed on what may be recommended. A recommendation may be made if the
                         firm has a reasonable basis to believe it is suitable. This can be based on information that the
                         firm knows. Both financial and nonfinancial information must be gathered before making
                         investment recommendations.

                                        Gather Financial Information
                                        Before making a recommendation for a new customer, a registered representative must try
                                        to find out as much as possible about that person’s financial and nonfinancial situation. In
                                        general, the best way to get the proper information is by completing a customer profile. This
                                        profile should contain financial and nonfinancial information.

                                        Financial investment considerations can be expressed as a sum of money. Financial questions
                                        have answers that show up on a customer’s personal balance sheet or income statement.
                                        Asking a customer, “when would you like to retire?” is not a financial question—it is
                                        nonfinancial. The answer does not show up on the customer’s personal balance sheet or
                                        income statement.


                                        Customer Balance Sheet
                                        An individual, like a business, has a financial balance sheet—a snapshot of the individual’s
                                        financial condition at a point in time. A customer’s net worth is determined by subtracting
                                        liabilities from assets (assets – liabilities = net worth). Representatives determine the status of a
                                        customer’s personal balance sheet by asking questions similar to the following:
                                         What is the value of any cash, CDs, and savings accounts (usually looked at as an
                                          emergency fund, generally considered to be a primary requirement for investing in
                                          securities).
                                         What are the values of tangible assets? Home? Car? Collectibles? Jewelry?
                                         What are the values of securities you currently own?
                                         Have you established long-term investment accounts, and what are the values of those
                                          accounts? Do you have an IRA, corporate pension, or profit-sharing plan, and what are
                                          the values of those plans?
                                         What is the cash value of your life insurance?
                                         What are your liabilities? How much do you owe on your mortgage? Car? Outstanding
                                          loans?
                                         Are there any loans against insurance cash value?
                                         How large is your credit card debt?
                                        From this information, we can determine the net worth and how much of it is liquid.


                                        Customer Income Statement
                                        To make appropriate investment recommendations, representatives must know the customer’s
                                        income situation. They gather information about the customer’s marital status, financial
                                        responsibilities, projected inheritances, and pending job changes by asking the following
                                        questions:
                                         What is your total gross income? Total family income?
                                         How much do you pay in monthly expenses?

                          What is your net spendable income after expenses? How much of this is available for
                           investment?
                          How secure is your employment?

                                   TAKE NOTE
                                   Before recommending any investment to a customer, a registered representative
                                   must, at a minimum, make a reasonable effort to obtain information concerning the
                                   customer’s financial status, tax status, and investment objectives.
                         Taking into consideration all of this information indicates to the securities professional the
                         extent to which the client is able to make a lump-sum investment (the balance sheet shows
                         a large amount of net assets available), and/or periodic investments (the income statement
                         reveals a positive cash flow—there is “money left at the end of the month”).


                                                                                                                                          Unit 2

                                   A family balance sheet only includes assets and liabilities, not income like salary,
                                   dividends, or interest, or amounts paid for expenses.

                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                   1.   An individual’s net worth is
                                         A. the difference between the individual’s assets and the individual’s liabilities.
                                         B. best determined by examining the individual’s personal income statement.
                                         C. largely irrelevant in identifying the individual’s investment objectives.
                                         D. another term for discretionary income.
                                        Answer: A. An individual’s net worth is the difference between the individual’s assets
                                        and the individual’s liabilities. It is determined from the personal balance sheet rather
                                        than from the personal income statement. Net worth is relevant in determining an
                                        individual’s investment objectives. Clients with a negative net worth might find it
                                        preferable to reduce their debt level before beginning an investment program.


              LESSON 2.2: CUSTOMER NONFINANCIAL PROFILE

                         LO 2.b Evaluate personal considerations other than financial.



                         Customer Profile: Nonfinancial Investment Considerations
                         Once registered representatives have an idea of the customer’s financial status, they gather
                         information on the nonfinancial status. A nonfinancial investment consideration is one
                         that cannot be expressed as a sum of money or a numerical cash flow (risk tolerance, or tax
                         bracket, for example). Nonfinancial considerations often carry more weight than the financial
                         considerations and include the following:
                          Age
                          Marital status
                          Number and ages of dependents
                          Employment
                          Employment of family members

                                         Current and future family health care needs
                                         Risk tolerance
                                         Attitudes and values, such as ESG investing
                                         Tax status
                                        No matter how much an analysis of a customer’s financial status tells the registered
                                        representative about the ability to invest, it is the customer’s emotional acceptance of investing
                                        and motivation to invest, which molds the portfolio.

                                        To understand a customer’s attitude for investment, the representative should ask questions
                                        similar to the following:
                                         What kind of risks can you afford to take?
                                         How liquid must your investments be?
                                         How important are tax considerations?
                                         Are you seeking long-term or short-term investments?
                                         What is your investment experience?
                                         What types of investments do you currently hold?
                                         How would you react to a loss of 5% of your principal? 10%? 50%?
                                         What level of return do you consider good? Poor? Excellent?
                                         What combination of risks and returns do you feel comfortable with?
                                         What is your investment temperament?
                                         Do you get bored with stable investments?
                                         Can you tolerate market fluctuations?
                                         How stable is your income?
                                         Do you anticipate any financial changes in the future?
                                        There certainly are shades of gray when defining a customer’s risk tolerance. This makes it even
                                        more critical that you and the customer are on the same page when it comes to risk tolerance.
                                        For test purposes, you can usually get the correct answer by identifying the key word.
                                         If you see low risk—conservative
                                         If you see some risk—moderate
                                         If you see more than average risk—moderately aggressive
                                         If you see high risk—aggressive
                                        If you key on the right word, you’ll get the correct answer.

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                    2.   In designing an investment portfolio for a new client, one of the first things to do is

                                         Answer: C. One can’t adequately present any investment recommendations without
                                         having an understanding of the client’s risk tolerance. Home address and Social
                                         Security number are legal requirements for opening the account, but they don’t enter
                                         into the decision-making process for portfolio design. Yes, you will want to know the
                                         beneficiary of any IRAs or qualified plans, but that has little to do with the nature of
                                         your recommendations.


                                    TAKE NOTE
                                    A registered representative’s job is to assist customers in meeting their financial
                                    objectives. Responsible reps must learn all about the customers’ financial situations.
                                    Securities laws prohibit unsuitable recommendations.
                         If a customer contacts a registered representative and wants to purchase securities that the rep
                         feels are not suitable for the client, the registered representative has a responsibility to tell the
                         customer that she feels the trade is not suitable. If the customer insists on the purchase, the

                                                                                                                                           Unit 2
                         registered representative should place the order and mark the trade unsolicited.

                         The following practice questions demonstrate two contrasting examples dealing with this LO.

                                    PRACTICE QUESTIONS
                                    3.   All of the following are financial considerations in a customer profile except
                                          A. the balance in the 401(k) plan.
                                          B. wanting to retire at age 65.
                                          C. annual income.
                                          D. the remaining balance on the home mortgage.
                                         Answer: B. Wanting to retire at age 65 is a goal and a nonfinancial consideration.
                                         Financial investment considerations can be expressed as a sum of money (total
                                         liabilities, for example) or as a numerical cash flow (gross income of $160,000 per
                                         year, for example).

                                    4.   Which of the following would be considered nonfinancial investment considerations
                                         on a customer profile?
                                          A. Total fixed assets
                                          B. Attitude toward risk
                                          C. Monthly income available for investment
                                          D. Amount saved in a 401(k) plan
                                         Answer: B. Nonfinancial investment considerations are those that cannot be
                                         expressed as a concrete sum of money or as a specific monthly, yearly, or weekly
                                         cash flow. Attitude toward risk cannot be expressed in numbers at all.


              LESSON 2.3: QUALIFYING THE CUSTOMER

                         LO 2.c Recall the methods to verify customer information including sophistication
                         and/or accredited status.



                         Verification of Customer Information
                         How is all of the information necessary to complete the customer profile obtained? Although
                         there is no universal method, most firms rely on a combination of tools. The first step is
                         usually having the client complete a detailed questionnaire. Optimally, this should be followed

                                       up by a personal interview, either in the office or home, on the phone, or online with one of
                                       the various video services available. There is only so much one can learn from a form, and
                                       both the client and the registered representative benefit from the give and take of an interview,
                                       as that is the best way to discover qualitative information, such as risk tolerance and attitudes.
                                       Traditionally, data-gathering techniques involve asking clients or prospects to bring in account
                                       statements, insurance policies, 401(k) plan options, and maybe tax returns. Why is all of this
                                       information needed? Without it, there is no way to determine suitability.

                                       Obtaining this information is critical when one needs to measure the sophistication of the
                                       investor. Viewing the types of securities previously or currently owned can provide a clue. In
                                       the case of investments requiring accredited investor status (covered extensively in Unit 20), it
                                       is even more important.


                                       Who is an Accredited Investor?
                                       Any individual with net worth in excess of $1 million, exclusive of the equity in a primary
                                       residence, or any individual who had an income in excess of $200,000 in each of the two
                                       most recent years or joint income with that person’s spouse in excess of $300,000 in each of
                                       those years and has a reasonable expectation of reaching the same income level in the current
                                       year. It is also anyone with a Series 7 license.

                                       Although the legal obligation for determining accredited investor status is that of the issuer,
                                       FINRA believes that each member should take reasonable steps to verify that status where
                                       applicable. Here are some of the recommended steps:
                                        Tax returns or W-2s for the previous two years
                                        Obtaining a written representation from the purchaser that he has a reasonable
                                         expectation of reaching the income level necessary to qualify as an accredited
                                         investor during the current year
                                        If the purchaser is an accredited investor on the basis of the $1 million net worth,
                                         reviewing one or more of the following types of documentation dated within the prior
                                         three months:
                                            –    Bank or brokerage account statements
                                            –    A credit report from at least one of the nationwide consumer reporting agencies

                                       Alternatively, the member firm can comply by doing the following:
                                        Obtaining a written confirmation from one of the following persons or entities that such
                                         person or entity has taken reasonable steps to verify that the purchaser is an accredited
                                         investor within the prior three months and has determined that such purchaser is an
                                         accredited investor

                                            –    An investment adviser registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission
                                            –    A licensed attorney who is in good standing under the laws of the jurisdictions in
                                                 which she is admitted to practice law

                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                   5.   A member firm wishing to verify the accredited investor status of a client would be
                                        least likely to ask for
                                          A. the past two years tax returns.
                                          B. a written confirmation from a lawyer admitted to the bar in the client’s state of
                                               residence.
                                          C. a current paycheck stub.
                                          D. bank or brokerage statements.
                                        Answer: C. Because we need to see income for the past two years, a current paystub
                                        does not provide sufficient information.


              LESSON 2.4: GOALS AND OBJECTIVES

                                                                                                                                          Unit 2
                         LO 2.d Discover the client’s goals and objectives.



                         Investment Goals
                         Using the information gathered about a client’s circumstances and financial resources, the
                         registered representative and client should establish financial goals. Many investors confuse
                         goals and objectives. A goal is where you want to be (the “end game”), while objectives are the
                         steps taken along the way to reach the goal. Some commonly specified goals include
                          planning for college education;
                          retirement;
                          saving for a future purchase, such as a home;
                          philanthropy;
                          capital to start a business; and
                          leaving a legacy.


                         Investment Objectives, Part 1
                         Investment objectives are the tools used to reach these goals. There are three primary
                         objectives:
                          Growth
                          Income
                          Stability (capital preservation)
                         However, in attempting to meet these objectives, there may be some obstacles, properly
                         referred to as investment constraints, (covered in the next LO), which must be considered. Let’s
                         examine some objectives in greater detail.

                         As stated previously, when it comes to investment objectives, there are three broad classes with
                         many shades in between:
                          Growth (can be aggressive, moderate, or even conservative)
                          Income (can be current, future, or high risk)
                          Preservation of capital (safety)

                                        There is a specific term for an objective that can be maximum income or maximum growth
                                        without regard to stability. That is speculation.

                                        You might find the concepts of investment objectives easier to understand if we use a little
                                        geometry. The picture is of an equilateral triangle. That means each of the sides (legs) is of
                                        the same length (equal). You will notice a letter at each point. The G is for growth, the I is
                                        for income, and the S is for safety (preservation of capital). Borrowing another term from
                                        geometry, it is axiomatic (true) that the closer you move on the leg to one of these points
                                        (objective), the farther you move from the others.

                                        For example, if you wish to maximize your growth, you go all the way to the G and move
                                        farther away from the I and the S. As a result, you sacrifice income and safety. Total safety,
                                        (all the way to the S), sacrifices growth and income, and maximum income sacrifices growth
                                        and safety. The role of the registered representative is to determine where in this triangle the
                                        customer’s objectives lie. They can be between the G and I when the objective is growth with
                                        income. Or, if the objective is income with safety, the point will be between the I and the S. It
                                        is important to understand you can’t maximize all three—something has to give.

                                                         objective?
                                                          A. Current income
                                                          B. Endowing a scholarship at your alma mater
                                                          C. Conservative growth
                                                          D. Speculation
                                                         Answer: B. Goals are what you hope to have the money for. Objectives are the way to
                                                         get there. Remember the triangle for G, I ,and S. The S is for stability. The opposite of
                                                         stability is speculation, and that is another one of the objectives. For some investors,
                                                         that is the route they choose to take.

                                        In Part 2 of this course, we’ll discuss the various investment options used to meet these
                                        objectives.

              LESSON 2.5: INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES VS. INVESTMENT
                          CONSTRAINTS
                          LO 2.e Distinguish between investment objectives and investment constraints.



                          Investment Objectives, Part 2
                          As mentioned in the previous LO, investment objectives are the steps taken by investors to
                          help them reach their stated goals. There are some potential obstacles in the way. These are
                          called investment constraints. Investment constraints are limitations or restrictions that are
                          specific to your client. Investment constraints include—among others—liquidity needs, time
                          horizon, and personal ethical choices (no tobacco or alcohol stocks). Let’s begin by going
                          deeper into objectives.

                                                                                                                                          Unit 2
                          Preservation of Capital
                          Many people want to avoid any drop in value of their investments. For these investors, bank
                          insured CDs, for example, offer the safety they seek. There is a trade-off, however. By reducing
                          risk, the investor is sacrificing the opportunity for higher income. In addition, as fixed-income
                          investments, they are exposed to inflation (purchasing power) risk.


                          Income
                          When the investor’s goal is income, a primary factor is the amount of risk the investor is
                          willing and/or able to take. The risk/reward principle is quite clear. The more risk, the greater
                          the potential reward. The reverse is also true. The lower the risk, the lower the potential
                          reward. As we see in our triangle, as you move on the leg closer to income, you move farther
                          away from safety. An example of a security suitable for an investor who wants both is one
                          issued by the U.S. Treasury. On the other hand, one wanting to maximize income would do
                          so at the risk of safety by investing in high-yield (junk) bonds.


                          Growth (Capital Appreciation)
                          As with income, the term growth refers to a broad spectrum of objectives. Some investors have
                          a very high risk tolerance and want their portfolio to be solidly on the G while others are quite
                          conservative and are closer to the S, while still on the “leg” toward growth rather than income.
                          Still others might want their portfolio to be on the leg between G and I. It is the role of the
                          registered representative to help the client understand where on the leg the portfolio should
                          lie.


                          Speculation
                          Although a subcategory of growth, speculation is often listed as a specific objective. A
                          customer may want to speculate—that is, try to earn much higher-than-average returns
                          in exchange for higher-than-average risks. Investors who are interested in speculation will
                          frequently use margin, sell short, and trade in options or penny stocks. As a registered
                          representative, one must always determine the suitability of such recommendations.

                                        Investment Constraints
                                        Once we’ve set our objectives, we need to look out for the “bumps in the road”; those things
                                        that can cause even the best plan to take a detour. Here are the major investment constraints
                                        you may find on your exam:

            Constraints                                          Description
            Time horizon                                         Time frame in which goals must be attained
            Liquidity                                            What is the cash need? High if close to goals
                                                                 (retirement or education); low if long time horizon
            Taxes                                                Tax characteristics of investor and desired level of
                                                                 tax management
            Laws and regulations                                 Any legal prohibitions on types of investments or
                                                                 transactions—is the investor accredited?
            Unique circumstances and/or preferences              Investor preferences or desires to avoid particular
                                                                 types of assets


                                        Time Horizon
                                        An investor’s time horizon and liquidity needs will determine the level of volatility the client
                                        should assume. Over a 20- or 30-year time frame, dramatic short-term volatility is acceptable,
                                        even to those who are risk averse. Money that will be needed within three to five years should
                                        be invested for safety and liquidity. Time horizon is a particularly important investment
                                        constraint when planning for college education and for retirement.


                                        Liquidity
                                        Some investors have a need for a certain sum, such as an upcoming home purchase or college
                                        tuition. Or, they might just like the idea that they can get their money literally at a moment’s
                                        notice. They need liquid assets in their portfolio. A product is liquid if a customer can sell it
                                        quickly at face amount (or very close to it) or at a fair market price.

                                        Remember that a liquid investment does not mean you won’t lose money on your investment.
                                        It simply means you can get the current market value of the investment quickly. Liquid
                                        investments include
                                         securities listed on an exchange or Nasdaq,
                                         mutual funds,
                                         exchange-traded funds, and
                                         most real estate investment trusts (REITs).
                                        Illiquid investments include
                                         annuities, when initially purchased and/or when the annuitant is under age 59½;
                                         real estate;
                                         securities purchased in a private placement;
                                         DPPs; and
                                         hedge funds.

                      Taxes
                      A client’s tax situation is often an important factor in determining suitable investments. For
                      exam purposes, there are two ways to reduce taxes—tax deferral and tax-free income.
                       Tax deferral. Contributions to an IRA, a qualified retirement plan, or a TSA may be tax
                        deductible and are not taxed until withdrawn. This gives two benefits to the investor.
                        Firstly, the investments are made with pretax money. Secondly, there are no taxes on the
                        income and growth until the money is paid out. That is the power of deferring taxes.
                       Tax-free income. Municipal bonds pay interest that is free from federal taxation. There
                        are cases where the income would be taxed on the state level; that will be covered in
                        Unit 6. Municipal bonds generally pay interest at a lower rate than taxable bonds. That
                        is because the interest is tax-free. Depending on the investor’s tax bracket, the municipal
                        bond may result in higher returns on an after-tax basis. As covered in Unit 1, it is also
                        possible to generate tax-free income using a Roth IRA and the Coverdell ESA. In Unit 6,
                        we will discuss the Section 529 plan—another way to provide tax-free income.
                                                                                                                                      Unit 2
                      Laws and Regulations
                      An example of how laws or regulations could be an investment constraint is the case of the
                      accredited investor. A registered representative may find the absolutely perfect investment to
                      meet the client’s objectives only to find out the client can’t make the purchase because of lack
                      of accredited investor status. Another case might be when the desired security is not registered
                      for sale in the client’s state of residence. As we’ve learned, there are certain investments that
                      are illegal or inappropriate for an IRA. That is what an investment constraint is all about: we’d
                      like to buy this, but we can’t.


                      Unique Circumstances and/or Preferences
                      Investors share many common characteristics. When you speak to a customer about goals, you
                      will notice how often the same ones keep coming up. That said, it is important to understand
                      that these are all unique individuals with their own needs and wants. We’ll take a look at how
                      some of those are investment constraints.

                      The most common case on the exam is the desire to avoid investing in certain industries. The
                      term ESG (Environment, Social and Governance) Investing has become more popular with
                      each passing year. Those investors who have a strong feeling about environmental issues won’t
                      invest in companies that are considered polluters or create other health issues. A test question
                      might ask about an investor whose parent died of lung cancer. The question might say “which
                      stock would be least like to be attractive to this client?” You should select tobacco companies.

                      Unique cases could be receiving a large inheritance or a multi-million dollar lottery win.
                      Objectives can change pretty quickly with those additional dollars. On the flip side, a client’s
                      business going bankrupt will cause the registered rep to rethink some recommendations. An
                      extended period of unemployment or serious illness can do the same.

                      What is the takeaway? Matching your recommendations to the customer’s goals and objectives
                      takes careful thought.

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                    7.   Which of the following is an investment constraint?
                                                          A. Retirement
                                                          B. Income
                                                          C. College education
                                                          D. Time horizon
                                                         Answer: D. One of the most important investment constraints is the investor’s time
                                                         horizon. If you start saving for retirement (a goal) at age 55, you don’t have much
                                                         time to accumulate funds. A short time horizon limits how aggressive the portfolio
                                                         can be. If you started at age 25, with that long a time horizon, there are many more
                                                         investment options available. Income is an objective and college education is a goal.
                                                         That goal is also affected by time horizon. It is much better to start saving for college
                                                         when a child is very young. You don’t want to wait until the teenage years.


           LESSON 2.6: FINRA RULE 2111 ON SUITABILITY

                                        LO 2.f Contrast reasonable basis, customer specific, and quantitative suitability.



                                        Suitability
                                        FINRA’s suitability rules have always been based on a fundamental requirement to deal fairly
                                        with customers. Firms and their associated persons must have a reasonable basis to believe
                                        that a recommended transaction or investment strategy involving securities is suitable for the
                                        customer.

                                        The more information a registered representative has about a customer’s income, current
                                        investment portfolio, retirement plans, and net worth, as well as other aspects of the
                                        customer’s financial situation, the better a recommendation will be. The more a customer
                                        knows about the risks and rewards of each type of investment, the better the customer’s
                                        investment decisions will be.


                                        Rule 2111
                                        In 2009, FINRA proposed a major change to its rules on suitability. Rule 2111, which
                                        became effective in 2011, is composed of three main obligations. Those three are
                                         reasonable-basis suitability,
                                         customer-specific suitability, and
                                         quantitative suitability.


                                        Reasonable-basis suitability
                                        The registered representative has to have a reasonable basis to believe that a recommendation
                                        is suitable for at least some investors. You must recognize the potential risks and rewards
                                        associated with the recommended security or strategy. If you can’t explain the risks when
                                        recommending a security or strategy, you are violating the suitability rule.

                     Customer-specific suitability
                     The registered representative has to have a reasonable basis to believe that the recommendation
                     is suitable for a specific customer. The recommendation would be based on that customer’s
                     investment profile. For example, you have an elderly person who, in the past, was relatively
                     sophisticated. Now, he shows signs of diminished capacity. This would require a different basis
                     for recommendations.


                     Quantitative suitability
                     The registered representative has to have a reasonable basis for believing that a series of
                     recommended transactions, even if suitable when viewed in isolation, are not excessive and
                     unsuitable for the customer when taken together. No single test defines excessive activity;
                     however, factors such as the commissions generated, the profits-to-cost ratio, and the use of
                     in-and-out trading in a customer’s account may provide a basis for a finding that a member or

                                                                                                                                Unit 2
                     registered representative has violated the quantitative suitability obligation.

                                      D. II and IV
                                    Answer: A. FINRA requires members and their registered representative who wish
                                    to make recommendations to perform both a reasonable-basis suitability analysis
                                    and a customer-specific suitability analysis. A reasonable-basis suitability analysis
                                    is necessary to ensure that an investment is suitable for some investors as opposed
                                    to a customer-specific suitability analysis, which is undertaken on a customer-by-
                                    customer basis.

                               What if the client refuses to supply enough information? Look at this question:

                               9.   A retail investor opens an account at your firm but only provides minimum
                                    information. She wants to invest for retirement in 20 years and is willing to take
                                    moderate risk. Which of the following statements best describes the responsibilities
                                    of the registered representative handling the account?
                                      A. Recommendations cannot be made because the customer refuses to provide
                                          income information, personal assets and liabilities, or how much can be
                                          invested.
                                      B. The account cannot be opened without financial and nonfinancial
                                          information.
                                      C. Only unsolicited trades can be made in this account.
                                      D. The representative is limited to what can be recommended to the customer
                                          based on the information that was provided.
                                    Answer: D. When limited information is provided for the account, the registered
                                    representative will be limited to making recommendations that she believes
                                    are suitable based on the information she has. She is missing customer-specific
                                    suitability. It is when the customer insists on making a trade that is considered
                                    unsuitable that the order must be marked unsolicited.

           LESSON 2.7: OPENING SPECIAL ACCOUNTS
                                        LO 2.g Identify the documentation and approval required for different types of
                                        accounts.

                                        In Unit 1, we discussed the different documents needed to open an account for a customer.
                                        That discussion was about the legal requirements, such as the CIP and Regulation S-P. In this
                                        LO, we’ll dig deeper for the papers needed for options and margin and discretionary accounts.


                                        Options Accounts
                                        There are some unique requirements to open options accounts. In Unit 10, we will learn
                                        much more about options. This LO is only about opening an account. Trading options (puts
                                        and calls) generally involves a higher degree of risk than stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. That
                                        higher risk requires that a designated supervisory person with knowledge about options must
                                        approve the account opening. In addition, there is a special options disclosure document
                                        (ODD) that must be provided to any prospective options customer.

                                        To get a customer’s account approved for options trading, a member firm, or registered rep
                                        associated with the broker-dealer, must exercise due diligence. You must learn the essential
                                        facts relative to the customer. This is nothing new. One question asked on a new options
                                        account form that is not required when opening a regular account is investment experience
                                        and knowledge. Examples of this would be the number of years of trading and the size of
                                        the trades. You would ask about frequency and type of transactions for options, stocks and
                                        bonds, commodities, and other financial instruments. The designated supervisor uses this
                                        information to approve or disapprove the account.

                                        The account approval will indicate
                                         the date the ODD is furnished to the customer;
                                         the nature and types of transactions for which the account is approved (e.g., buying,
                                          covered writing, uncovered writing, spreading, discretionary transactions);
                                         the name of the registered rep assigned to the account;
                                         the name of the supervisor approving the account;
                                         the date of approval; and
                                         the dates of verification of currency of account information.
                                        There is a special options account agreement. It describes the risks of options trading and the
                                        rules the customer must follow. This agreement must be signed and returned to the member
                                        within 15 days after the account has been approved. By signing, the customer also agrees to
                                        advise the firm if any changes occur in her financial situation, investment objectives, and so
                                        forth.

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 10. When a registered representative opens a new options account for a client, in which
                                     order must the following actions take place?
                                        I. Obtain approval from a qualified supervisor.
                                       II. Obtain essential facts from the customer.
                                      III. Obtain a signed options agreement.
                                      IV. Enter the initial order.

                                       B. I, II, IV, III
                                       C. II, I, IV, III
                                       D. II, I, III, IV
                                     Answer: C. The steps in opening an options account occur in the following order:
                                     obtain essential facts about the customer, give the customer an options disclosure
                                     document (ODD), have the manager approve the account, enter the initial order, and
                                     have the customer sign and return the options agreement within 15 days.
                                                                                                                                       Unit 2

                      Margin Accounts
                      Opening a margin account requires more documentation than opening a regular cash
                      account. The margin agreement includes three documents. They are
                       the credit agreement (mandatory),
                       the hypothecation agreement (mandatory), and
                       a loan consent (optional).
                      FINRA rules require that the client sign the margin documents no later than the first trade in
                      the account.


                      Credit Agreement
                      The credit agreement discloses the terms of the credit extended by the broker-dealer. These
                      include the method of interest computation and situations under which interest rates may
                      change. As stated earlier, this must be signed.


                      Hypothecation Agreement
                      Margin loans are backed by collateral. In that way, they are similar to a home mortgage or a
                      car loan. In the case of a mortgage, the house is pledged as collateral for the loan. In the case
                      of the car, the title shows a lien to the lender. In a margin account, the collateral is the security
                      purchased on margin. In essence, the hypothecation agreement gives the broker-dealer a lien
                      on the customer’s margin securities. And, as with the credit agreement, this must be signed by
                      the customer.


                      Loan Consent Form
                      If signed, the loan consent form gives permission to the firm to loan customer margin
                      securities to other customers or broker-dealers, usually for short sales.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    It is mandatory that the customer sign the credit agreement and hypothecation
                                                    agreement. The loan consent form is optional.


                                        Risk Disclosure
                                        In addition to the customer agreements, the member firm must make a special disclosure.
                                        Before opening a margin account, a broker-dealer must provide customers with a risk
                                        disclosure document. This information must also be provided to margin customers on an
                                        annual basis. The document discusses the risks associated with margin trading, some of which
                                        follow:
                                         Customers are not entitled to choose which securities can be sold if a maintenance call is
                                          not met.
                                         Customers can lose more money than initially deposited.
                                         Customers are not entitled to an extension of time to meet a margin call.
                                         Firms can increase their in-house margin requirements without advance notice.

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                    11. When opening a margin account, it is mandatory that the customer sign
                                                         A. the credit agreement and the loan consent agreement.
                                                         B. the credit agreement and hypothecation agreement.
                                                         C. the hypothecation agreement and the loan consent agreement.
                                                         D. the credit agreement only.
                                                         Answer: B. The two documents that must be signed are the credit agreement and
                                                         the hypothecation agreement. The loan consent agreement is optional.


                                        Discretionary Accounts
                                        In a discretionary account, the customer has authorized the broker-dealer or registered
                                        representative to make the investment decisions in the account.

                                        Discretion is defined as the authority to decide
                                         which security,
                                         the number of shares or units, or
                                         whether to buy or sell.
                                        Normally, an order to buy or sell a security is at the direction of the client, generally via
                                        a telephone call or online. Many clients prefer the convenience of letting their securities
                                        professional “call the shots.” Being able to determine the trading activity in a client’s account
                                        presents a potential conflict of interest. In the case of broker-dealers and agents, their
                                        compensation is transaction-based. The more trading in the account, the more income.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    To identify a discretionary order, try this method: an order is discretionary if any one of
                                                    the three As is missing. The three As are
                                                        activity,
                                                        amount, and
                                                        asset.

                       the account has been accepted by the brokerage firm, as evidenced in writing by the firm.
                      No discretionary transactions can take place without this document on file. Once
                      authorization is given, the firm is legally empowered to make trading decisions for the
                      account, although the customer may also continue to enter orders on his own if he wishes.


                      Discretion—Time or Price
                      There is an exception to the requirement that applies to the exercise of time or price
                      discretion. This is discretion orally granted by the customer to purchase or sell a specific

                                                                                                                                      Unit 2
                      amount of a particular security (e.g., “Buy 100 shares of ABCD and get the best price you
                      can”).

                      An oral grant of time or price discretion is limited to the end of the business day on which
                      the customer grants it. If the order is to be good from longer than that day, the customer
                      must state it in writing. Any exercise of time or price discretion must be reflected on the order
                      ticket (as is the case with regular discretion).

                                TAKE NOTE
                                Discretion does not apply to decisions regarding the timing of an investment or the
                                price at which it is acquired.

                                EXAMPLE
                                An order from a customer worded “Buy 100 shares of ABC for my account whenever
                                you think the price is right” is not a discretionary order because the client has
                                specified the action (buy), the amount (100 shares) and the asset (ABC). Time or price
                                are not considered discretion.
                      In addition to requiring the proper documentation, discretionary accounts are subject to the
                      following rules:
                       Each discretionary order must be identified as such when it is entered for execution.
                       An officer or a partner of the brokerage house must approve each order promptly and in
                        writing, but not necessarily before order entry.
                       A record must be kept of all transactions.
                       No excessive trading or churning may occur in the account relative to the size of the
                        account and the customer’s investment objectives.
                       The account must be checked regularly.


                      Fiduciary Accounts
                      A fiduciary is one who has the legal power to act on behalf of another person. Common
                      examples are
                       a trustee named to administer a trust,
                       an executor designated in a decedent’s will to manage the affairs of the estate,




Series_7_2E.indb 61                                                                                                        11/19/2021 7:52:29 PM
           62         Unit 2   Obtain Necessary Suitability Information and Approvals



                                         an administrator appointed by the courts to liquidate the estate of a person who died
                                          intestate (without a will),
                                         a guardian designated by the courts to handle a minor’s affairs until the minor reaches the
                                          age of majority or to handle an incompetent person’s affairs,
                                         a custodian of a Uniform Gift to Minors Account (UGMA) or a Uniform Transfer to
                                          Minors Account (UTMA),
                                         a receiver in a bankruptcy, and
                                         a conservator for an incompetent person.
                                        Opening a fiduciary account requires evidence of the individual’s appointment and authority.
                                        This usually comes from a court. Someone can’t claim to be the executor for a deceased person
                                        without some proof. A court appointed guardian is another case where proof of capacity must
                                        be given. No documentation is required for an individual to open an UGMA or UTMA
                                        account. Discretionary authority usually makes one a fiduciary.

                                        An account for a trustee must include a trust agreement detailing the limitations placed on the
                                        fiduciary. Investments in a trust account should follow the directives of the trust document.
                                        Margin accounts are only permitted if authorized by the legal documents establishing the
                                        fiduciary accounts.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    This might not be on the exam, but you should know that fiduciaries are obligated to
                                                    follow the Uniform Prudent Investor Act (UPIA). UPIA currently appears on some other
                                                    exams so it may soon appear on the Series 7 Top-Off Exam.

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                    12. Which of the following accounts could be opened without any legal documents?
                                                         A. UTMA
                                                         B. Trust
                                                         C. Estate
                                                         D. Pension plan
                                                         Answer: A. Fiduciary accounts require legal documentation establishing the power
                                                         of the fiduciary. There is an exception for UTMA and UGMA accounts.


                                        Business Accounts
                                        The documentation for business accounts is not a commonly tested item. Here are few points
                                        that might appear.


                                        Corporate Accounts
                                        A registered representative who opens a corporate account must establish
                                         the business’s legal right to open an investment account;
                                         an indication of any limitations that the owners, the stockholders, a court, or any other
                                          entity has placed on the securities in which the business can invest; and
                                         who will represent the business in transactions involving the account.

                                                          Unit 2   Obtain Necessary Suitability Information and Approvals       63


                      When opening an account for a corporation, a firm must obtain a copy of the corporate
                      charter, as well as a corporate resolution. The charter is proof that the corporation does exist,
                      and the resolution authorizes both the opening of the account and the officers designated to
                      enter orders.


                      Partnership Accounts
                      As covered earlier, some businesses are organized as partnerships. Partnerships frequently open
                      cash, margin, retirement, and other types of accounts necessary for business purposes.

                      The partnership must complete a partnership agreement stating which of the partners can
                      make transactions for the account. If the partnership opens a margin account, the partnership
                      must disclose any investment limitations.

                      An amended partnership agreement must be obtained each year if changes have been made.

                                                                                                                                       Unit 2
                      Sole Proprietorship Accounts
                      This is the simplest form of business organization and is opened like an individual account.

                                PRACTICE QUESTION
                                13. If Alpha Enterprises, Inc., wants to open a cash account, a firm must have all of the
                                    following documents on file except
                                      A. a hypothecation agreement.
                                      B. a new account form.
                                      C. a copy of the corporate charter.
                                      D. a copy of the corporate resolution.
                                     Answer: A. A hypothecation agreement is only needed to open a margin account.
                                     Any cash account must have a new account form on file. For corporate account,
                                     the corporation’s charter must be provided as proof that the corporation exists. In
                                     addition, a corporate resolution is needed to designate the officer(s) authorized to
                                     enter orders.


                      Numbered Accounts
                      If requested, a customer’s account may be identified by only a multi-digit number or symbols.
                      The customer must sign a form certifying that he owns the account(s) identified by the
                      number or symbols. This is not like the old Swiss bank accounts use for tax avoidance. The tax
                      reporting is done the same as any other account.

                                EXAMPLE
                                Celebrities sometimes use numbered accounts to preserve anonymity.

              INTRODUCTION
                         An important part of a registered representative’s work is to make suitable investment
                         recommendations and provide appropriate information for the customer to use in making
                         investment decisions. In the previous part, we discussed many of the suitability requirements.
                         Those included information gathering and understanding goals and objective. The major
                         emphasis of this part is identifying the investment products that fit the customer’s needs. In
                         doing so, the registered representative must also understand the various forms of investment
                         risk and the relationship between risk and reward inherent in securities investment. Recognizing
                         how to use this information is covered in this part and will include portfolio theory,
                         fundamental analysis, and product selection based on objectives of the customer.

                         Most of Part 2 is about matching the right investment products to the customer’s objectives.

                                        A security is an investment that represents either an ownership stake or a debt stake. An
                                        investor becomes part owner in a corporation by buy­ing shares of the company’s stock. That
                                        is called having an equity position—the topic of this unit. A debt security (Unit 4), is usually
                                        acquired by buying an issuer’s (company or government) bonds. A debt investment is a loan
                                        to the issuer in exchange for interest income and the promise to repay the loan at a future
                                        maturity date. It does not confer ownership (equity) as does the purchase of stock.

                                        Investors become owners of a corporation by purchasing stock in that company. They
                                        can participate in the company’s prosperity by sharing in earnings through the receipt of
                                        dividends. Common stock holders have the opportunity to benefit from an increase in the
                                        price of the shares.


           LESSON 3.1: FUNDAMENTALS OF COMMON STOCK
                                        LO 3.a Identify the types of common stock.



                                        Origins of Common Stock
                                        The two primary types of equity securities are common and preferred stocks (covered in
                                        Lesson 3.2). These are considered ownership positions in a corporation. All corporations
                                        issue common stock. Each share of common stock entitles its owner to a portion of the
                                        company’s profits and dividends and an equal vote on directors and other important matters.
                                        Most corporations are organized in such a way that their common stockholders regularly vote
                                        for and elect candidates to a board of directors (BOD) to oversee the company’s business.
                                        By electing a BOD, stockholders have some say in the company’s management but are not
                                        involved with the day-to-day details of its operations.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   An individual’s common stock ownership represents her proportionate interest in a
                                                   company. If a company issues 100 shares of stock, each share represents an identical
                                                   1/100, or 1%, ownership position in the company. A person who owns 10 shares of
                                                   stock owns 10% of the company; a person who owns 50 shares of stock owns 50% of
                                                   the company.
                                                   Common stock can be classified as
                                                      authorized,
                                                      issued,
                                                      outstanding, or
                                                      treasury.


                                        Authorized Stock
                                        A corporation is a legal being. Corporations are formed through the preparation of a
                                        corporate charter. In many respects, corporations can do the same things as a natural person.
                                        One of those things is opening a brokerage account as we noted in Part 1. What a corporation
                                        can do that individuals can’t is raise money by issuing securities. The corporate charter
                                        specifies the number of shares the company is authorized to issue. It is a decision made by the
                                        founders of the business.

                                                                                            Unit 3   Equity Securities       69


                      In most cases, a company does not issue all of the authorized shares. It issues enough of
                      them to raise sufficient capital for its expected needs. The company may sell the remaining
                      authorized shares in the future or use them for other purposes. If the company wants to issue
                      more shares than are authorized, the charter must be amended through a stockholder vote.


                      Issued Stock
                      Issued stock is authorized stock that has been sold to investors. Those investors have bought
                      the stock and the company has received the money. When a corporation issues or sells fewer
                      shares than the total number authorized, it normally reserves the unissued shares for future
                      needs, including
                       raising new capital for expansion,
                       paying stock dividends, or
                       exchanging common stock for outstanding convertible bonds or preferred stock.
                      Authorized but unissued stock does not carry the rights and privileges of issued shares and is
                      not considered in determining a company’s total capitalization. Authorized but unissued stock
                      is similar to the blank checks in your check book. They’re ready to use when needed. Until
                      then, they are just pieces of paper.


                      Outstanding Stock
                      Outstanding stock includes any shares that a company has issued and are in the hands of
                      investors. Isn’t all issued stock outstanding? Sometimes it is, but other times it is not. As we
                      will read next, sometimes a corporation buys back its outstanding stock. Sometimes, owners                     Unit 3
                      of the stock will donate it to the company. However the company gets it back, that stock is no
                      longer outstanding.


                      Treasury Stock
                      Treasury stock is stock a corporation has issued and subsequently reacquired. The corporation
                      can hold this stock indefinitely or can reissue or retire it. Treasury stock does not carry the
                      rights of outstanding common shares, such as voting rights and the right to receive dividends.
                      For that reason, analysts are only concerned with outstanding shares.

                                TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                Expect to see a question on outstanding stock similar to the following.
                                ABC Company has authorized 1 million shares of common stock. It issued 800,000
                                shares one year ago. It then purchased 200,000 shares for its treasury. How many
                                shares of ABC stock are outstanding?
                                The solution requires that you know a basic formula:
                                    issued stock – treasury stock = outstanding stock
                                In applying this formula to our sample question, the solution is as follows:
                                    800,000 – 200,000 = 600,000
                                Alternatively, treasury stock equals issued shares minus outstanding shares.

                                                  This question illustrates a point about FINRA exams. The question provided
                                                  information about the number of shares of authorized stock, but that information
                                                  was not necessary for you to solve the problem. Prepare for questions that give you
                                                  more information than you need. The Series 7 exam expects you to know concepts so
                                                  well that you can determine both what is and what is not essential to the solution of a
                                                  problem.

                                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  1.   ABC Company has authorized 3 million shares of common stock. It issued 70% of
                                                       those shares one year ago. It then purchased 600,000 shares for its treasury. How
                                                       many shares of ABC stock are outstanding?

                                                       Answer: B. The solution requires you to know a basic formula:

                                                           issued stock – treasury stock = outstanding stock

                                                       Thus, 3,000,000 × 70% = 2,100,000 – 600,000 = 1,500,000.

                                                       ABC Company has 1,500,000 shares of common stock outstanding.

                                       Common Stock Characteristics

                                       Limited Liability
                                       Stockholders cannot lose more than the amount they have invested to buy the stock. Those
                                       who own stock in a corporation cannot be held liable for the company’s debts. That means
                                       if the business goes bankrupt, the creditors cannot come after the shareholders. That is the
                                       concept behind limited liability.


                                       Residual Claims to Assets
                                       If a corporation is liquidated, the common stockholder has a residual right to claim
                                       corporate assets. This means they come after all debts and other security holders have been
                                       satisfied. The common stockholder has the last claim (if there is anything left). Maybe that is
                                       why it is compared to the residue.

                                                  TAKE NOTE
                                                  Because common stock is last in line in a corporate liquidation, it is known as the most
                                                  junior security.

                      Stock Splits
                      Investors and company executives are generally happy to see a company’s stock price rise.
                      However, a high market price may scare away investors. To make the stock price attractive to a
                      wider base of investors—that is, small versus institutional investors—the company can declare
                      a stock split.

                      A forward stock split increases the number of shares. This reduces the price without affecting
                      the total market value of shares outstanding. An investor will receive more shares, but the
                      value of each share is reduced. The total market value of the ownership interest is the same
                      before and after the split. Think of a 2-for-1 stock split as nothing other than changing a $10
                      bill for two $5s. You have twice as many bills, but each is worth half of the previous bill.

                                TAKE NOTE
                                For an investor who owns 100 shares valued at $20 per share
                                    a 2:1 stock split results in that investor owning 200 shares at $10 per share; and
                                    the value of the investment does not change—before and after the split the value
                                     is $2,000.
                                To determine the number of shares after a split, multiply the number of shares owned
                                by the first number of the split and then divide by the second number (2:1).
                      A reverse split has the opposite effect on the number and price of shares. After a reverse split,
                      investors own fewer shares worth more per share. In the earlier example, a 1:2 reverse split
                      would mean 50 shares at $40 each. Once again, the total value is unchanged at $2,000.


                      Stock Dividends                                                                                                 Unit 3

                      Do not confuse a stock dividend with a stock split. One option a corporation has is to pay
                      common stockholders a dividend in additional shares of the stock. This saves the cash that
                      would be used in a normal dividend while giving stockholders something at no cost. For
                      example, if an investor owned 100 shares of the stock and the company declared a 20% stock
                      dividend, that investor would receive 20 additional shares, bringing the total holding up to
                      120 shares. Just as with the stock split, there is no real change to the overall value. The market
                      price of the stock drops. For example, if the stock was selling at $60 per share before the
                      dividend, it would now be selling at $50. Check the math. Divide $60 by 120% and you get
                      $50. The investor had 100 shares worth $6,000. The investor now has 120 shares at $50, or
                      $6,000. There are important tax issues we will cover later in this unit.


                      Transferability
                      In almost all cases, shares of stock are freely transferrable. That means that shareholders do
                      not need the permission of the issuer—or anyone else—to sell their stock in the open market.
                      This is especially true in the case of shares traded on the major stock exchanges. This means
                      that stock has good liquidity. Liquidity is the ability to get your money quickly at a fair price.
                      One exception is restricted stock, where sales are contingent upon meeting the requirements
                      of SEC Rule 144. Restricted stock will be covered in Unit 20.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   2.   An investor owning 400 shares of XYZ notices that the company will be engaging in a
                                                        3:2 stock split. As a result of this action, the investor will receive how many additional
                                                        shares?
                                                          A. 100
                                                         B. 200
                                                         C. 400
                                                         D. 600
                                                        Answer: B. This split will increase the shareholder’s position by a ratio of 3 to 2. That
                                                        means, after the split, the investor will own 600 shares (400 × 3/2 or 400 × 3 divided
                                                        by 2). If the investor currently has 400 shares and will have 600 after the split, it
                                                        means the XYZ will send this shareholder 200 additional shares. More than half of our
                                                        students answer 600—that is the total, but not the additional. You have to read the
                                                        questions carefully.


                                        LO 3.c Consider the rights of a common stockholder.



                                        Rights of Common Stock Ownership
                                        Stockholders are owners of a company and therefore have certain rights that protect their
                                        ownership interests.


                                        Voting Rights
                                        As mentioned earlier, common stockholders have the right to vote. Early in this unit,
                                        we mentioned the vote for the BOD. There are other issues that can be the subject of a
                                        shareholder vote. Voting generally takes place at the company’s annual meeting and could
                                        include such topics as
                                         issuance of convertible securities or additional common stock;
                                         substantial changes in the corporation’s business, such as mergers or acquisitions; and
                                         declarations of stock splits (forward and reverse).
                                        You probably won’t have to know the reason, but here is why they get to vote on issuing
                                        convertible securities. As we will discuss in Unit 5, a convertible security gives the owner the
                                        right to swap that security for common shares of the issuer. When that happens, there are
                                        more shares outstanding (those authorized but unissued shares or treasury stock are used).
                                        The company is no larger, but the “pie” is split into more “pieces.” This is a concept known as
                                        dilution. You see that happen when you put some ice cubes into a drink and come back later,
                                        after they’ve melted. The drink has been diluted.


                                        Calculating the Number of Votes
                                        A stockholder can cast one vote for each share of stock owned. Depending on the company’s
                                        bylaws and applicable state laws, a stockholder may have either a statutory or cumulative vote.
                                         Statutory voting. Statutory voting allows a stockholder to cast one vote per share owned
                                          for each item on a ballot, such as candidates for the BOD. A board candidate needs a
                                          simple majority to be elected.
                                         Cumulative voting. Cumulative voting allows stockholders to allocate their total votes in
                                          any manner they choose.

                                EXAMPLE
                                XYZ Corporation will be electing three directors at its annual meeting. Each XYZ
                                shareholder has a number of votes equal to the number of shares owned times the
                                number of directorships up for election. Assume a shareholder owns 100 shares.
                                Under statutory voting, the shareholder may use a maximum of 100 votes for any one
                                seat on the board.
                                Under cumulative voting, the shareholder may allocate all 300 votes to one director,
                                giving the shareholder a greater impact.
                                Statutory vs. Cumulative Voting
                                Example One: Mr. X Owns 100 Shares

                                       Statutory Voting

                                Cumulative voting benefits the smaller investor, whereas statutory voting benefits
                                larger shareholders.


                                TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                Shareholders do not vote on dividend-related matters, such as when they are
                                declared and how much they will be. They do vote on stock splits, board members,
                                and issuance of additional equity-related securities such as common stock, preferred
                                stock, and convertible securities.


                      Proxies
                      Stockholders often find it difficult to attend the annual stockholders’ meeting, so most vote on
                      company matters by means of a proxy, a form of an absentee ballot. After it has been returned
                      to the company, a proxy can be automatically canceled if the stockholder attends the meeting,
                      authorizes a subsequent proxy, or dies. When a company sends proxies to shareholders, usually
                      for a specific meeting, it is known as a proxy solicitation. A stockholder may revoke a proxy at
                      any time before the company tabulates the final vote at its annual meeting.


                      Nonvoting Common Stock
                      Companies may issue both voting and nonvoting (or limited voting) common stock, normally
                      differentiating the issues as Class A and Class B, respectively. Issuing nonvoting stock allows
                      a company to raise additional capital while maintaining management control and continuity
                      without diluting voting power.

                                       Preemptive Rights
                                       When a corporation raises capital through the sale of additional common stock, it may be
                                       required by law or its corporate charter to offer the securities to its common stockholders
                                       before the general public. This is known as an anti-dilution provision. Stockholders then have
                                       a preemptive right to purchase enough newly issued shares to maintain their proportionate
                                       ownership in the corporation.

                                                  TAKE NOTE
                                                  Preemptive rights give investors the right to maintain a proportionate interest in a
                                                  company’s stock.

                                                  EXAMPLE
                                                  ABC has 1 million shares of common stock outstanding. Grace Billings owns 100,000
                                                  shares of ABC common stock, or 10%. If ABC issues an additional 500,000 shares,
                                                  Billings will have the opportunity to purchase 50,000 of those shares. If Billings
                                                  decides to exercise the rights, her proportionate ownerships remains the same. It not,
                                                  she will own a lower percentage. We say that her interest in the company is diluted
                                                  (weakened).

                                       Inspection of Corporate Books
                                       Stockholders have the right to receive annual financial statements and obtain lists of
                                       stockholders. Inspection rights vary from state to state and are unlikely to be tested because
                                       of the lack of uniformity.


           LESSON 3.2 OTHER EQUITY SECURITIES

                                       LO 3.e Recognize the characteristics of preferred stock.

                                       As mentioned earlier, the two basic forms of ownership in a company are common and
                                       preferred stock. We’ve already covered common stock. Now, it is time to learn about preferred
                                       stock.


                                       Preferred Stock
                                       Preferred stock represents ownership, (equity), in the corporation. However, it does not
                                       normally offer the appreciation potential associated with common stock. Not all corporations
                                       issue preferred stock.

                                       For test purposes, preferred stock is always issued with a fixed (stated) rate of return. That
                                       fixed return is a fixed dividend that is being paid. As such, these securities are generally
                                       purchased for income. Although the dividend of most preferred stocks is fixed, some are
                                       issued with a variable dividend payout known as adjustable-rate preferred stock. Like other

                     fixed-income assets such as bonds, preferred stock prices tend to move inversely with interest
                     rates. On the exam, preferred stock is nonvoting.

                     Preferred stock does not typically have the same growth potential as common stock. That
                     makes it subject to inflation risk. However, preferred stockholders generally have two
                     advantages over common stockholders:
                      When the BOD declares dividends, owners of preferred stock must receive their stated
                       dividend in full before common stockholders may receive a dividend.
                      If a corporation goes bankrupt, preferred stockholders have a priority claim over common
                       stockholders on the assets remaining after creditors have been paid.

                     Because of these features, preferred stock appeals to investors seeking income and safety.
                     Following are some of the key characteristics of preferred stock.

                                TAKE NOTE
                                Preferred stock has preference over common stock in payment of dividends and in
                                claim to assets in the event the issuing corporation goes bankrupt. However, preferred
                                stock does not get to vote.


                     Fixed Rate of Return
                     Preferred stock’s fixed dividend is a key attraction for income-oriented investors. Normally,
                     a preferred stock is identified by its annual dividend payment stated as a percentage of its par
                     value. A preferred stock with a par value of $100 that pays $6 in annual dividends is known
                     as a 6% preferred. Or the dividend could just be stated as an annual amount. Typically on
                     no-par stock. In the earlier example, it would be known as a $6 preferred. If the stock had                   Unit 3
                     a $25 par value with a 4% dividend rate, the dividend would be $1.00. This could also be
                     referred to as a $1.00 preferred. On the exam, assume all dividends are paid quarterly. On the
                     $6 preferred, that would be 4 dividends of $1.50. On the $25 par, 4% stock, that would be 4
                     dividends of $0.25.

                     One important point about these dividends is that, just as with common stock, there is
                     no obligation for them to be paid. This is not a debt security where interest payments are
                     required. It takes a vote of the BOD for the dividend to be declared. What is true is that the
                     dividend is fixed and it must be paid before common.

                     The stated rate of dividend payment causes the market price of preferred stock to move
                     opposite changes in interest rates. That is, as interest rates climb, the prices of preferred stocks
                     decline. The reverse is true when interest rates go down. If preferred stock pays dividends, not
                     interest, why should changes to interest rates have any impact on the preferred? We’ll address
                     that in greater detail in Unit 14. The fixed dividend on preferred stock provides a fixed income
                     in the same way as interest paid on a bond. Regardless of the source, (dividend or interest),
                     investors demand a return comparable to current rates in the market. For the moment,
                     perhaps the following example will make some sense.

                                EXAMPLE
                                Consider a 6% preferred. If the stock has a par value of $100, that is $6 per year. If
                                interest rates are at 8% and you want to sell your preferred, you will not be able to get
                                $100 for it. Why not? Why would an investor settle for a 6% return when an 8% return
                                is the current standard? You would only be able to get about $75 for the stock. Why
                                $75? Because a $6 dividend (remember, the amount of the dividend is fixed) on an




Series7_03.indd 75                                                                                                          15/12/22 9:28 AM

                                                   investment of $75 equals a return of 8%. If interest rates fall to 4%, the 6% preferred
                                                   will trade at a premium. Because it is offering a stream of income above the current
                                                   market rate, it will command a higher price. In this case, the price would likely be $150.
                                                   Check the math: $6 on an investment of $150 = 4% (6 divided by 150).

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   Preferred stock represents ownership in a company like common stock, but its price is
                                                   sensitive to interest rates—just like the price of a bond.
                                                   Although it is a fixed-income investment, preferred stock, unlike bonds, has no preset
                                                   date at which it matures and no scheduled redemption date or maturity value.


                                        Categories of Preferred Stock
                                        There are several different types of preferred stock starting with straight preferred (think of
                                        plain vanilla). From there, it can expand, depending on which and how many adjectives we
                                        use to describe the security. However, all maintain preference over common stock. Preferred
                                        stock may have one or more of the following characteristics.


                                        Straight (Noncumulative)
                                        Straight preferred has no special features beyond the stated dividend payment. The year’s
                                        stated dividend must be paid on straight preferred if any dividend is to be paid to common
                                        shareholders. If the company can only pay part, or none of the dividend this year, it does not
                                        have to be made up in future years. Using our $6 preferred, any payment less than $6 for the
                                        year is forever gone. In this case, obviously, nothing can be paid to the common.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   Preferred stock with no special features is known as straight preferred.


                                        Cumulative Preferred
                                        Buyers of preferred stock expect fixed dividend payments. We just gave an example of a
                                        company where the dividend was paid in part or skipped completely. With cumulative
                                        preferred, any dividends skipped must be paid before paying a common dividend. The
                                        technical term for missed dividends is dividends in arrears.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   Any special feature attached to preferred, such as a cumulative feature, has a price.
                                                   The cost for such a benefit is less dividend income. Cumulative preferred typically has
                                                   a lower stated dividend than straight preferred (less risk equals less reward).
                                                   The company keeps records of the skipped dividends. When the time comes that
                                                   it is able to pay, all of the arrearage (the dividends in arrears) are paid to holders of
                                                   cumulative preferred. Not only that, but the current dividend must be paid as well if
                                                   the company wishes to pay a dividend on the common. For those seeking income,
                                                   cumulative is safer than straight. That is why the dividend rate is somewhat lower. As
                                                   we said, it is the risk/reward concept.

                                 EXAMPLE
                                 RST Corporation has both common stock and cumulative preferred stock outstanding.
                                 Its preferred stock has a stated dividend rate of 5% (par value $100). Because of
                                 financial difficulties, no dividend was paid on the preferred stock last year or the year
                                 before. RST wishes to declare a dividend on its common stock this year. RST must first
                                 pay how much in dividends to the cumulative preferred shareholders?
                                 RST must pay missed dividends to cumulative preferred (as well as the current
                                 dividend) before dividends are paid on common stock. RST must pay $5 for two years
                                 ago, $5 for last year, and $5 for this year, for a total of $15.
                                 If this had been a straight preferred, the answer would have been $5. Only the current
                                 year’s dividend would need payment before common because straight preferred is not
                                 entitled to dividends in arrears.


                      Convertible Preferred
                      A convertible preferred gives the owner the right to exchange each preferred share for shares
                      of common stock. The conversion rate is fixed at the time of issue. It may be shown as the
                      number of shares, such as convertible into four shares. Or, it may be shown as the price at
                      which the investor can convert. You divide the par value by the conversion price to see the
                      number of shares of common.

                      The convertible feature results in these shares having a lower dividend rate. Why is that?
                      Because the ability to convert a preferred into common stock offers growth potential not
                      otherwise available to a preferred stockholder. This feature causes the stock’s price to track
                      that of the common. That results in convertible preferred stock having less interest rate risk
                      than the others. When the underlying common stock has the same value as the convertible                         Unit 3
                      preferred, it is said to be at its parity price. This concept will be covered in detail in Unit 5.

                                 EXAMPLE
                                 XYZ Company’s convertible preferred stock, with a par value of $100. The conversion
                                 price is $20. That means it can be exchanged for five shares of XYZ common stock
                                 ($100 ÷ $20 = 5). This is true, no matter what the current market value is of either the
                                 preferred or the common stock. Assume an investor bought the preferred for $100 per
                                 share. Sometime later, the common stock rises in price to $25 per share. Converting
                                 would give the investor 5 shares at $25. That represents a profit of $25 stemming from
                                 the conversion feature.


                      Participating Preferred
                      Like other preferred stock, there is a fixed dividend. In addition, participating preferred
                      stock is eligible to receive a percentage of the common dividend. The maximum percentage
                      is stated when the stock is issued. Before the participating dividend can be paid, a common
                      dividend must be declared. How else could they participate?

                                 EXAMPLE
                                 A preferred stock is described as “XYZ 6% preferred participating to 50%.” In addition
                                 to the fixed dividend, the company could pay holders of this stock up to 50% of the
                                 common dividend.

                                       Callable Preferred
                                       Corporations often issue callable preferred or redeemable preferred. This means the
                                       company can buy back the stock from investors at a stated price on the call date or any date
                                       thereafter. The call feature would most likely be used when interest rates decline. They could
                                       issue a new preferred with a lower dividend and use that money to call in the old stock. In
                                       that way, it is similar to refinancing a loan when interest rates go down. We’ll discuss that
                                       more in Unit 5.

                                       When a corporation calls a preferred stock, that stock basically ceases to exist. Dividend
                                       payments and conversion rights end on the call date. In most cases, the call price is at a
                                       premium over the par value. An example could be $103 for a $100 par value stock. The extra
                                       money is to compensate the investors for having to look for a new investment.

                                                  TAKE NOTE
                                                  A risk in buying callable preferred stock is that the issuer may decide to redeem it.
                                                  That ends dividend payments. We already mentioned that the call price is higher than
                                                  the par value. This helps ease the pain of having to look for another stock. Another
                                                  benefit is that callable preferred generally has a higher dividend rate than straight,
                                                  noncallable preferred.


                                       Adjustable-Rate Preferred
                                       Some preferred stocks are issued with adjustable/variable dividend rates. The adjustment is
                                       made based on a chosen standard. The interest rate on U.S. government Treasury bills is one
                                       frequently used. These adjustments are done with a frequency determined by the issuer (as
                                       short as monthly, as long a annually). The advantage to an adjustable-rate preferred stock is
                                       that it does not have the interest rate risk of other fixed-income securities. This is because its
                                       income isn’t really fixed. When interest rates go up, so does the dividend.

                                                  PRACTICE QUESTIONS
                                                  3.   The BOD of DDC omitted dividends in 2017 on their $100 par 6% noncumulative
                                                       preferred stock. In 2018, a $2 preferred dividend was paid. For DDC, 2019 has been
                                                       a good year, and the board wishes to pay a common dividend. How much must be
                                                       paid per share on the preferred for 2019 to pay a common dividend?

                                                        B. $8
                                                        C. $12
                                                        D. $16
                                                       Answer: A. A 6% dividend on a $100 par means a $6 dividend per share each year.
                                                       Because this preferred stock is noncumulative, any missed dividends do not have to
                                                       be paid before common dividends can be declared. If this were a cumulative issue,
                                                       any dividends not fully paid would go into arrears and accumulate until paid to the
                                                       preferred cumulative stockholder. During this time, common dividends cannot be
                                                       declared or paid until the cumulative holders receive their full dividend amount.

                                                       investor who likes a fixed dividend but also would like to take advantage of capital
                                                       appreciation if the company’s common stock rises?

                                    Answer: B. Convertible preferred stock has a fixed-stated dividend and can
                                    be converted to the company common stock if the price of the common stock
                                    appreciates. Participating preferred stock might have an increased dividend, but
                                    no capital appreciation. The dividend on adjustable-rate preferred will periodically
                                    change. That would not meet the needs of a client who wants a fixed dividend.


                     LO 3.f Compare rights and warrants.



                     Preemptive Rights
                     Existing stockholders have preemptive rights or stock rights. These entitle them to maintain
                     their proportionate ownership in a company. This is done by giving them the right to buy
                     newly issued shares before the company offers them to the public. A rights offering allows
                     stockholders to purchase common stock below the current market price. The rights are valued
                     separately from the stock, and trade in the secondary market during the subscription period.

                     Although referred to as an equity security, these rights are not ownership. Only when
                     exercised does the investor have more shares. Just like any other shares, they have voting and
                     dividend rights. Remember that rights themselves do not pay dividends and do not vote.

                     A stockholder who receives rights may
                      exercise the rights to buy stock by sending the rights certificates and a check for the
                       required amount to the rights agent,
                      sell the rights and profit from their market value (rights certificates are negotiable
                                                                                                                                  Unit 3
                       securities), or
                      let the rights expire and lose their value.
                     Shareholders who do not wish to exercise their rights will find an active secondary market for
                     them. Those rights generally trade on the same stock market as the common stock. Shortly, we
                     will show you how to compute their value.


                     Subscription Right Certificate
                     A subscription right is a certificate representing the privilege to buy additional shares of
                     a corporation. The corporation sends this certificate to each common stockholder. The
                     certificate grants one right for each share of common stock they own. These rights have a
                     short lifespan, expiring generally within 30-45 days of issue, rarely more than 60. As you will
                     see in our examples, it usually takes more than one right to buy one share of the new stock.


                     Terms of the Offering
                     Described in the subscription right certificate are the terms of the offering. These terms would
                     include the number of new shares a stockholder may buy and the subscription (exercise) price.
                     The final date for exercising the rights is shown and, in many cases, the date the new shares
                     will be issued.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   ABC Company plans to raise capital by issuing additional stock and, on April 1,
                                                   declares a rights offering. Common stockholders as of May 1, the record date, can
                                                   subscribe to one new share, at a price of $30, for each 10 shares of stock they own.
                                                   ABC stock is currently trading at $41 per share. The rights will expire on June 18.
                                                   The corporation will issue rights to stockholders of record May 1. That means their
                                                   names on the company’s records as shareholders.
                                                   The common stock trades cum (with) rights until the ex- (without) date. The ex-date
                                                   is the first day it is too late for investors to buy the stock and get their names on the
                                                   company’s records. It is generally one business day before the record date (the day
                                                   the company makes the list of owners). In this case, the ex-date would be April 30.
                                                   As we will cover in detail in Unit 17, it takes two business days to get your name on
                                                   the company’s books. An investor who buys stock cum rights receives the right. An
                                                   investor who buys stock ex-rights does not.
                                                   The number of rights required to buy one new share is based on the number of shares
                                                   outstanding and the number of new shares offered.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   ABC will be issuing 1 million new shares. ABC has 10 million shares currently
                                                   outstanding. Each share is entitled to one right. That means 10 million rights will be
                                                   issued. How many rights will it take to buy one share? The math is simple. With 10
                                                   million rights to buy 1 million shares, a shareholder will need 10 rights to buy one
                                                   share. We divided 10 million by 1 million to get our answer. If our example said ABC
                                                   is issuing 2 million shares, how many rights would it take to buy one share? Five,
                                                   because 10 million divided by two equals five.

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   Many investors prefer to sell their rights rather than exercise them. Because those
                                                   rights enable the holder to buy the stock at a price below the current market, they
                                                   have a value. The exam may ask you to compute the theoretical value of a right. It
                                                   makes a difference if it is trading cum rights or ex-rights. Let’s use a case where the
                                                   value is computed cum rights. Consider the following: ABC’s price per share is $41; the
                                                   subscription per share is $30. Ten rights are needed to purchase one share of stock.
                                                   We compute the value of one right as follows:

                                                           market price – subscription price
                                                       number of rights to purchase 1 share + 1

                                                        41 – 30            11
                                                                     =             = $1
                                                         10 + 1            11
                                                   On the morning of the ex-date, the market price typically drops by the value of the
                                                   right. Use the ex-rights formula to determine the value of a right after the
                                                   ex-date. The ex-rights formula is:

                                                          market price – subscription price
                                                        number of rights to purchase 1 share

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 In dealing with any question on the value of a right, you will not have to adjust market
                                 price. The questions deal only with the value of the right. That makes your only
                                 decision whether to divide MP – SP by N or N + 1. The easy way to remember is this:
                                 When the question asks for the value of a right before the ex-date (cum rights), the
                                 formula is with 1. If it ask for the value of a right on or after the ex-date, it is without
                                 the 1.


                      Stand By Underwriter
                      What happens when some of the shareholders fail to exercise their rights? Perhaps they let
                      them lapse, or maybe they didn’t understand what the right was about. Maybe they just didn’t
                      have the money to exercise, or maybe they just ignored the mail carrying the notice.

                      In Unit 20, we will discuss the various methods of bringing a new issue to the public. Part of
                      the discussion is the role of the investment banker or underwriter who assists the issuer. When
                      it comes to a rights offering, there is a special role that is played by the broker-dealer serving as
                      the underwriter of the offering. That is the role of the stand by underwriter.

                      When a company’s current stockholders do not exercise their preemptive rights in an
                      additional offering, a corporation has an underwriter standing by to purchase whatever shares
                      remain unsold as a result of rights expiring.

                      Because the standby underwriter unconditionally agrees to buy all shares that current
                      stockholders do not subscribe to at the subscription price, the offering is a firm commitment.

                                 TAKE NOTE                                                                                              Unit 3
                                 By engaging a standby underwriter, an issuer is assured of selling all the shares being
                                 offered.


                      Warrants
                      A warrant is a certificate granting its owner the right to purchase securities from the issuer at
                      a specified price. Warrants are sometimes confused with rights. We’ll take a look at some of
                      the differences and similarities.

                      Unlike a right, a warrant is always a long-term instrument. There is no standard length, but
                      they generally have an expiration date at least two years after issue. A more typical length is
                      five years. In some cases, the expiration date is much longer than that. In fact, years ago, a few
                      companies issued perpetual warrants. Those never expire.

                      Unlike rights, the purchase price is always higher than the current market price on the date of
                      issue of the warrant.

                                 EXAMPLE
                                 The ABC Corporation issues warrants to purchase shares of its common stock. Each
                                 warrant allows the holder to purchase 100 shares. The exercise price is $30 per share
                                 while the current market price is $25 per share.
                      As with rights, although referred to as an equity security, these warrants are not ownership.
                      Only when exercised does the investor have more shares. Just like any other shares, they have
                      voting and dividend rights. Remember that warrants themselves do not pay dividends and do
                      not vote.

           82         Unit 3   Equity Securities



                                        Origination of Warrants
                                        Warrants are usually offered to the public as sweeteners, or inducements, in connection with
                                        an offering of other securities, such as bonds or preferred stock. This makes those securities
                                        more attractive. Most investors like the fact that they have a chance to benefit from an
                                        increase in the price of the company’s stock. This attractiveness enables the issuer to reduce the
                                        interest cost of debt or the fixed dividend of preferred stock. Such offerings are often bundled
                                        as units.

                                        After issuance, the warrants are detachable and may trade separately from the bond or
                                        preferred stock. When first issued, a warrant’s exercise price is set somewhat above the stock’s
                                        market price. If the stock’s price increases above the exercise price, the owner can exercise
                                        the warrant and buy the stock below the market price or sell the warrant in the market. A
                                        logical question is, “why would anyone be interested in a warrant enabling a purchase of the
                                        underlying stock at a price above the current market?” Remember, warrants have a typical life
                                        of five years or even longer. When we cover options, you will learn about time value. In five
                                        years, a stock’s market price could increase substantially, making that warrant quite valuable.

                                        The following chart summarizes the key testable points about these securities.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   5.   Rank the following securities from the same issuer from most suitable to least
                                                        suitable for a client whose primary objective is income with relative safety.
                                                           I. Cumulative preferred stock
                                                          II. Convertible preferred stock
                                                         III. Common stock
                                                         IV. Warrant
                                                          A. I, II, III, IV
                                                          B. I, III, II, IV
                                                          C. III, I, IV, II
                                                          D. II, III, IV, I
                                                        Answer: A. For a client seeking income with some safety, preferred stock—especially
                                                        one that is cumulative—would be the most suitable of the choices given. Convertible
                                                        preferred stock generally pays a lower dividend rate than other preferred stocks.
                                                        This is because of the attractiveness of the convertibility. Although there are some
                                                        categories of common stock (e.g., utility stocks that pay liberal dividends), unless
                                                        specifically mentioned, you can assume that preferred stock dividends are higher
                                                        than those for common stock of the same issuer. Warrants (and rights) never provide
                                                        any income.

                                                                                            Unit 3   Equity Securities       83



                      LO 3.g Describe the types of non-U.S. market securities.



                      American Depositary Receipts (ADRs)
                      An American depositary receipt (ADR) is simply a receipt for shares of a foreign stock
                      deposited with a custodian. In that respect, it is similar to a stock certificate. The stock
                      certificate shows ownership in a company’s stock. The ADR shows ownership in the deposited
                      security. Each ADR represents a specific number of shares in a foreign company held by a
                      custodian. That custodian is typically a domestic bank in the United States. The stock must
                      remain on deposit as long as the ADRs are outstanding. That is because the ADRs are the
                      depositary bank’s guarantee that it holds the stock.

                      ADRs are securities that trade on the U.S. securities markets. ADRs are in English and trade
                      in U.S. dollars.


                      Rights of ADR Owners
                      ADR owners have most of the rights common stockholders normally hold. These include the
                      right to receive dividends when declared. Most important, those dividends are in U.S. dollars.
                      That simplifies things for the investor. It is much easier to deposit a dollar check than to have
                      to worry about converting currency.

                      Generally, ADRs do not have voting rights, though some ADR issuers will pass on voting
                      rights to the holders of ADRs. As for preemptive rights, the issuing bank sells off the rights
                                                                                                                                     Unit 3
                      and distributes the proceeds pro rata to holders. That point is unlikely to be tested.

                                PRACTICE QUESTION
                                6.   An ADR represents
                                      A. a U.S. security trading in a foreign market.
                                      B. a foreign security trading in the United States.
                                      C. a U.S. security trading in both the United States and a foreign market.
                                      D. a foreign security trading in both the United States and a foreign market.
                                     Answer: B. ADR stands for American depositary receipt. ADRs are receipts issued
                                     by U.S. banks. They represent ownership of a foreign security and trade in the U.S.
                                     securities markets.


                      Delivery of Foreign Security
                      ADR owners have the right to exchange their ADR certificates for the foreign shares they
                      represent. They can do this by returning the ADRs to the depositary banks, which cancel the
                      ADRs and deliver the underlying stock. This is rarely done, but is an option available for the
                      ADR holder.


                      Taxes on ADRs
                      In most countries, a withholding tax on dividends is taken at the source. In the case of
                      investors holding ADRs, this would be a foreign income tax. The foreign income tax may be
                      taken as a credit against any U.S. income taxes owed by the investor.

                                        Currency Risk
                                        In addition to the normal risks associated with stock ownership, ADR investors are subject to
                                        currency risk. We will cover that risk in more detail in Unit 14. Simply, the foreign company
                                        is paying dividends in its local currency. If that currency drops in value compared to the U.S.
                                        dollar, the investor receives less money, even if the dividend stays level. The same is true with
                                        the market value of the stock. The stock’s price can go up in its local market, but, if the value
                                        of that currency falls, the ADR investor’s value can go down.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   The custodian holding the actual shares receives dividends in the foreign currency. It
                                                   then converts them to U.S. dollars. This leads to potential currency risk. Because ADRs
                                                   originate outside the United States, they are also subject to political risk.


                                        Registered Owner
                                        ADRs are registered on the books of the U.S. banks responsible for them. The individual
                                        investors in the ADRs are not considered the stock’s registered owners. ADRs are registered
                                        on the books of U.S. banks, so dividends are sent to the custodian banks as registered owners.
                                        The banks collect the payments and convert them into U.S. dollars.


                                        Sponsored ADRs
                                        All exchange-listed ADRs are sponsored—that is, the foreign company sponsors the issue
                                        to increase its ownership base. Issuers that sponsor ADRs provide holders with financial
                                        statements in English. Sponsored ADRs are sometimes referred to as American depositary
                                        shares (ADS). For exam purposes, we do not expect you to have to know the subtle difference
                                        between an ADR and an ADS. Nonsponsored ADRs are issued by banks without the
                                        assistance and participation of the issuer.


           LESSON 3.3 TRADING PLACES

                                        LO 3.h Examine the different market places for equity securities.

                                        No, we are not talking about the wonderful movie of the same name. There are two terms
                                        used to describe the marketplace for securities. The primary market is the market in which
                                        the proceeds of sales go to the issuer of the securities sold. That is generally called the new
                                        issues market and will be covered in Unit 20. The secondary market is where previously issued
                                        securities are bought and sold. This unit will focus on secondary market trading of equity
                                        securities.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   The Securities Act of 1933 regulates activity in the primary market. That is, the market
                                                   place for new issues. The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 regulates the activity in the
                                                   secondary market. That is, the buying and selling of securities once they have been
                                                   distributed in the primary market. Most of our discussion in this course will be about
                                                   the secondary market. It is important to recognize that the SEC, under the powers
                                                   granted in the Exchange Act, aims to protect investors by regulating the exchanges, the
                                                   over-the-counter market, the extension of credit by the Federal Reserve Board,
                                                   broker-dealers and their registered representative, insider transactions, trading
                                                   activities, client accounts, and financial requirements.

                      Stock Exchanges
                      After the initial offering, many stocks are bought and sold on exchanges in a two-way
                      auction process. The major exchanges include the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), NYSE
                      American LLC (formerly known as the American Stock Exchange (AMEX)), the Chicago
                      Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and the Nasdaq Stock Market. Other trades take place in
                      the nationwide network of broker-dealers known as the over-the-counter (OTC) market.

                      The exchange market is composed of the NYSE and other exchanges on which listed
                      securities are traded. Listed security refers to any security that is bought and sold on an
                      exchange. Each stock exchange requires corporations to meet certain standards before it
                      will allow their stock to be listed for trading on the exchange. Listing requirements are not
                      tested. Those of the NYSE are the most stringent. In terms of dollar volume, trading on
                      the exchanges dwarfs that of the OTC markets. Many of the stocks listed on the NYSE are
                      considered “blue-chips.” The term refers to the common stock of well-known companies with
                      a history of growth and dividend payments. A typical example would be those found in the

                      The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires registration of an exchange with the SEC.
                      Under that act, the SEC has many powers including enforcement of the laws.

                      Historically, stock exchanges had physical trading floors. For the most part, with the notable
                      exception of the NYSE, today’s stock exchange is an electronic market. The Nasdaq Stock
                      Market is the best example of an electronic stock exchange.

                      As of the date of this printing, there are 21 exchanges registered as national stock exchanges
                      with the SEC. At one time, there were some regional stock exchanges, but they have either
                                                                                                                                  Unit 3
                      been closed or merged into the national ones.

                      Historically, stock exchanges operated as auction markets. That is the correct answer to a
                      possible test question. Floor brokers competed to execute trades at the most favorable prices.
                      That process still exists on some exchanges. The designated market maker, (DMM), formerly
                      called the specialist, conducts the auction. We will discuss this in more detail in Unit 17.


                      The Over-the-Counter Market (OTC)
                      In terms of the number of securities traded, the OTC market is the largest in the U.S. The
                      OTC market functions as an interdealer market in which unlisted securities—that is,
                      securities not listed on any exchange—trade.

                      In the OTC market, computers and telephones connect securities dealers across the country.
                      Thousands of securities are traded OTC, including stocks, corporate bonds, and all municipal
                      and U.S. government securities. One of the best known of the OTC markets is the OTC
                      Bulletin Board where stocks that do not qualify for listing on the exchanges are traded.
                      Another is the OTC Link, which for many years was known as the Pink Sheets because the
                      quotes were printed on pink colored paper. In general, the OTC Link stocks do not trade very
                      often. We say they are thinly traded stocks. Like securities traded on the exchange, these are
                      registered with the SEC, but tend to be on the highly speculative side. In a later unit, we will
                      learn that these stocks are not eligible for margin trading.

                      Unlike the NYSE, the OTC market has no central marketplace. Trading takes place over the
                      phone, over computer networks, and in trading rooms across the country. The OTC market is
                      an interdealer network. While the NYSE has the DMM to facilitate trading on the floor, the
                      OTC market has market makers. A market maker chooses to “deal” in selected OTC stocks.
                      This is similar in concept to an auto dealer choosing to deal in certain brands.

                                        Just as the auto dealer maintains an inventory of that brand to sell, the market maker has its
                                        selected stocks in its inventory. Just as auto dealers are willing to buy your old car, market
                                        makers are ready to buy shares of those stocks. Just as auto dealers compete to advertise the
                                        best prices, market makers compete to post the best prices at which they are ready to buy or
                                        sell those stocks. We will cover the details of how they work in Unit 17. The correct answer to
                                        a possible test question is that the OTC market is a negotiated market.


                                        Electronic Communications Network (ECN)
                                        Technology has made many advances in the securities industry. One area of the OTC
                                        market is the electronic system known as an electronic communications network (ECN).
                                        Broker-dealers can send an order through an ECN instead of going through a market maker.
                                        An ECN is an electronic trading system that automatically matches buy and sell orders at
                                        specified prices. ECNs are SEC-sanctioned alternative trading systems (ATS). They are open
                                        24 hours a day. There is no inventory; the ECN matches buy and sell orders as agents, not as
                                        principals. Extended hours orders are handled by ECNs.

                                        Throughout the history of trading securities in the United States, the NYSE set the stan­dards.
                                        Normal trading times were from 9:30 am until 4:00 pm ET Monday–Friday. However, in the
                                        latter part of the 20th century, the demand for after-hours trad­ing grew. Now, after the closing
                                        bell, ECNs make it easy for both institutional and individual investors to trade anytime.


                                        Dark Pools
                                        Dark pools, sometimes referred to as dark pools of liquidity, is trading volume that occurs that
                                        is not openly available to the public. The bulk of this volume represents large trades engaged
                                        in by institutional traders and trading desks away from the exchange markets. Generally, these
                                        large volume transactions occur on ECNs. The orders are matched electronically for execution
                                        without routing the order to marketplace where last sale price and volume information is
                                        displayed.

                                        Institutions choosing to use dark pools are able to execute large block orders without affecting
                                        public quotes or prices. In this way, they do not reveal their investment strategy. The public
                                        does not see what they are buying or selling. Indeed, orders can be placed anonymously so
                                        that the identity of the entity placing the order is unknown to the general investing public
                                        along with the volume and price for the transaction. The concern with dark pools is that
                                        some market participants are left disadvantaged because they cannot see the trades, volume,
                                        or prices agreed upon within the pools. This lack of transparency is why they are called dark
                                        pools.

                                        Dark pools account for about 17% of the trading volume in the U.S. stock market.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   7.   The OTC market is a negotiated market. This is best described by saying that buyers
                                                        and sellers
                                                         A. bid and offer in a public place.
                                                         B. bid and offer continuously.
                                                         C. arrive at an agreeable price by bargaining.
                                                         D. must accept prices set by dealers.
                                                        Answer: C. Unlike the exchanges, which are considered auction markets, prices on
                                                        OTC securities are determined by negotiation (bargaining) between broker-dealers.

              LESSON 3.4: TAXATION OF EQUITY SECURITIES
                          LO 3.i Differentiate between the different kinds of tax treatment of equity securities
                          (e.g., qualified dividends).

                          As we discussed at LO 2.e, one of the investment constraints is taxes. In this lesson, we are
                          going to focus on the tax considerations facing investors in equity securities.


                          Portfolio Income
                          Portfolio income includes dividends, interest, and net capital gains derived from the sale
                          of securities. No matter what the source of the income, it is taxed in the year in which it is
                          earned.


                          Dividends
                          Dividends are an important source of income for holders of equity securities. In the case of
                          preferred stock, it is usually the main purpose of the investment. That can be true of some
                          common stocks as well. Dividends on preferred stock are always paid in cash. Dividends on
                          common stock may be paid in cash or as additional shares of stock (stock dividend).


                          Cash Dividends
                          On the exam, most of the cash dividends will be qualified. No, that does not have anything to
                          do with the qualified retirement plans described in Part 1 of this course. As you move through           Unit 3
                          your studies, you will notice that some words are repeated, but with different meanings.
                          Qualified is one of them. If the dividend qualifies, the tax rates are lower than if nonqualified.

                          If the dividend is qualified, the tax rate is generally a maximum of 15%. It can be as high
                          as 20% or more for taxpayers in the highest brackets, but that is unlikely to be tested. If the
                          dividend is nonqualified, ordinary income tax rates apply. For test purposes, assume that any
                          dividend from a U.S. corporation, including mutual funds, is qualified, unless the question
                          states otherwise.

                                    TAKE NOTE
                                    You do not need to know the technical points that make a dividend qualify. Just
                                    know that the tax rate is lower than the ordinary income rate applied to nonqualified
                                    dividends.


                          Stock Dividend
                          When a corporation pays a stock dividend, it pays out shares of common stock rather than
                          cash. As covered in Lesson 3.1, there is no monetary change to the investor’s account. There
                          are more shares, but each share has a lower price. This results in the total value remaining the
                          same. The IRS does not consider stock dividends taxable when paid. What is required is an
                          adjustment to the cost basis of the shareholding. How does that work?

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   We are going to use the numbers from the example used earlier in this unit. “For
                                                   example, if an investor owned 100 shares of the stock and the company declared a
                                                   20% stock dividend, that investor would receive 20 additional shares, bringing the
                                                   total holding up to 120 shares. Just as with the stock split, there is no real change to
                                                   the overall value. The market price of the stock drops. For example, if the stock were
                                                   selling at $60 per share before the dividend, it would now be selling at $50. Check the
                                                   math. Divide $60 by 120% and you get $50. The investor had 100 shares worth $6,000.
                                                   The investor now has 120 shares @ $50, or $6,000.” That $50 per share is known as the
                                                   investor’s cost basis.
                                                   How does this apply to the taxation? The investor’s stock now has an adjusted cost
                                                   basis of $50 per share. There was no tax due when the additional 20 shares was
                                                   received. Instead, when any or all of the 120 shares are sold, taxes will be based on
                                                   the difference between that $50 cost and the sale price of the shares using the holding
                                                   period of the original purchase. That leads us to the next topic.


                                        Capital Gains and Losses
                                        The sale of a security at a price higher than its cost results in a profit. In tax language, this is a
                                        capital gain. If sold at a lower price than it cost, there is a loss. We refer to this as a capital loss.
                                        These losses and gains fit into one of two categories. They are either short-term or long-term.
                                        The dividing line is 12 months.

                                        For any security sold within 12 month of purchase, the holding period is short-term. From
                                        one day plus 12 months, it is long-term. Why do we care? We care because the tax treatment
                                        favors long-term gains. At the end of the tax year, investors compute all of their gains and
                                        their losses. Comparing them tells us if there is a net loss or a net gain.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   During 2019, an investor made the following transactions:
                                                       Sold 100 shares of ABC at $40 per share on December 15. The shares were
                                                        purchased on February 11, 2019, at $35 per share.
                                                       Sold 200 shares of DEF at $70 per share on April 22. The shares were purchased on
                                                        September 22, 2017, at $50 per share.
                                                       Sold 100 shares of GHI at $20 per share on November 13. The shares were
                                                        purchased on July 31, 2018, at $30 per share.
                                                       Bought 1,000 shares of JKL at $30 per share. The price of JKL on December 31 was
                                                        $100 per share.
                                                   What are the investor’s tax consequences for 2019?
                                                   The first step is to compute the gains and losses. Trade #1 resulted in a short-term (10
                                                   month holding period) gain of $5 per share, or $500. Trade #2 results in a long-term
                                                   (more than 12-month holding period) gain of $20 per share or $4,000. Trade #3 results
                                                   in a long-term loss of $10 per share or $1,000. Trade #4 has not happened yet. Until the
                                                   shares are sold, there is no taxable gain. This is known as an unrealized gain (we can
                                                   also have an unrealized loss).
                                                   We compare our gains and losses. The only short-term transaction is the gain of $500.
                                                   We have two long-term transactions. There is the gain of $4,000 and the loss of $1,000.
                                                   The net long-term result is a capital gain of $3,000. For tax purposes, the investor will
                                                   report a short-term capital gain of $500 and a long-term gain of $3,000. The tax rate

                                on short-term gains is the same as ordinary income like salary. The tax on long-term
                                capital gains is the same as that of qualified dividends, generally 15%.
                                What if the selling price of the stock in trade #1 was $30 instead of $40? That would
                                have given the investor a short-term capital loss of $500. In that case, the $500 loss
                                would have been compared the $3,000 long-term gain. For tax purposes, the investor
                                would report a net long-term gain of $2,500.
                      Using this information, as well as what we discussed with stock dividends, here is the type of
                      question you might see on your exam.

                                PRACTICE QUESTION
                                8.   Florence Forte purchased 100 shares of YXC common stock for $22 per share on
                                     February 12, 2018. She received a 10% stock dividend on May 18, 2019. She sold all of
                                     her YXC at $25 per share in June of the same year. What are the tax consequences of
                                     her trades?
                                      A. $500 long-term gain
                                      B. $550 long-term gain
                                      C. $300 long-term gain; $250 short-term gain
                                      D. $500 long-term gain; $50 short-term gain
                                     Answer: B. We compare the cost to the proceeds. Florence paid $2,200 for 100
                                     shares. She received an additional 10 shares from the stock dividend. Then, she sold
                                     all 110 shares for $25 per share—$2,750. The difference between the cost and the
                                     proceeds is $550. The holding period was from February 2018 to June 2019—more
                                     than 12 months. That makes the gain long-term.


                      Net Capital Losses                                                                                             Unit 3
                      When the net position is a capital gain, it is relatively simple. Short-term gains are taxed at
                      ordinary income rates and long-term gains at 15% (unless in the highest tax brackets). It
                      makes no difference if the gain is $100 or $1 million—all of it is taxable. The story is different
                      when it comes to net capital losses.

                      Capital losses that exceed capital gains are deductible against earned income. The annual
                      maximum is $3,000 per year. What if the losses are greater than $3,000? The excess over
                      $3,000 may be carried forward indefinitely as a deduction to offset capital gains in future
                      years. If the losses carried forward are short-term, they keep that status.

                                EXAMPLE
                                An investor had net capital losses in 2018 of $10,000. They were all short-term. The
                                investor deducts $3,000 of that against earned income in 2018. That leaves $7,000
                                carried forward to 2019. If the investor had no transactions in 2019, the deduction
                                would be another $3,000. The investor carries forward the remaining $4,000 to 2020 as
                                a short-term loss. If in 2020 the investor has net gains of $2,000 short-term and $3,000
                                long-term, the loss carry forward of $4,000 is used first against the short-term gain. The
                                $2,000 left reduces the $3,000 of long-term gain to a net gain of $1,000.
                      We will cover the taxation of the various securities products in their units. Then, in Unit 13,
                      we’ll learn about how taxes affect the recommendations you make to your clients. We will also
                      introduce you to the wash sale.

                                                   9.   Cindy Castle purchased 100 shares of XYC common stock for $19 per share on
                                                        February 12, 2019. She received a 10% stock dividend three months later on May 18.
                                                        She sold all of her XYC at $13 per share in June of the same year. What are the tax

                                                        Answer: A. Castle paid $1,900 for 100 shares. She received an additional 10 shares
                                                        from the stock dividend. Then, she sold all 110 shares for $1,430 (110 at $13). Because
                                                        the transactions all took place in less than a year, the transaction was a short-term
                                                        loss.


           LESSON 3.5: RULES APPLYING TO THE SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES

                                        LO 3.d Evaluate the risks of penny stocks.



                                        Penny Stock Risks
                                        The first step in a discussion of penny stocks is to define them. The full legal description is
                                        long and complicated. We are just going to keep it simple in Series 7. If the stock trades for
                                        less than $5 per share and is not listed on a major exchange such as the NYSE or the Nasdaq
                                        Stock Market, it is a penny stock. Many penny stocks do trade for pennies, but you can find
                                        some trading at $3 or $4 per share. As equity securities, they have the risks that any other
                                        common stock would have. In addition, we are going to investigate risks unique to penny
                                        stocks. Suffice it to say, penny stocks are highly speculative securities.


                                        Lack of Transparency
                                        Penny stocks trade on the OTC Bulletin Board and the OTC Link. The requirements for
                                        trading there are less stringent than the major exchanges. Coverage by analysts is spotty, so
                                        getting information is more difficult than with listed stock.


                                        Lack of Liquidity
                                        Penny stocks may trade infrequently, which means that it may be difficult to sell penny stock
                                        shares once you own them. There may not be a buyer—at least at the price you want—when
                                        you need to sell. They are an example of what we call thinly traded securities. Thinly traded
                                        securities usually have a large spread between the buy and sell price. We will cover that
                                        concept in Unit 13.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   A penny stock broker-dealer may publish a quote on a penny stock as $0.54 bid, $0.65
                                                   ask. This means you can buy the stock at 65 cents or sell it at 54 cents. That 11-cent
                                                   difference, called the spread, means you are immediately at a loss if you have to sell.

                      No Track Record
                      Many penny stock companies are new. Some have little or no operating history. The SEC
                      warns that investors in penny stocks should be prepared to lose all of their investment.


                      Pump and Dump
                      This is a fraudulent activity where unscrupulous firms or investors spread rumors in an
                      attempt to “pump” up the stock’s price. If enough investors bite, the price rises and the
                      promoters then “dump” their shares. This causes the price to drop and the unknowing
                      investor suffers a big loss.


                      LO 3.j Determine the rules and regulations pertaining to the sale of equity
                      securities.



                      Penny Stock Rules
                      The highly speculative nature and risks of penny stocks carry special rules to protect investors.
                      In the industry, they are known as the 15g rules. You can find them in Section 15(g) of the
                      Securities Exchange Act. They go from 15g-1 to 15g-100. Following are the ones you would
                      likely see on the exam. Although we are listing them with their rule numbers, that is not
                      testable information.


                      Risk Disclosure Document                                                                                    Unit 3
                      Rule 15g-2 requires that customers, before their initial transaction in a penny stock, be given
                      a copy of the Risk Disclosure Document. The member firm must receive a signed and dated
                      acknowledgment from the customer that the document has been received. In addition to
                      obtaining the client’s signature, the SEC requires the firm to wait at least two business days
                      after sending the statement before executing the first trade. This is to give clients time to
                      carefully consider their trade. Not surprisingly, the document describes penny stocks in less
                      than flattering terms.


                      Disclosure of Quotations
                      Rule 15g-3 requires members to provide penny stock purchasers with a current bid and asked
                      quote on the stock to prevent the practice of quoting prices that are away from the current
                      market to customers. The quote information must be provided to the customer orally or in
                      writing before effecting any transaction with the customer for the purchase or sale of any
                      penny stock. This information is also sent in writing with the trade confirmation.


                      Disclosure of Compensation
                      Rules 15g-4 and 15g-5 require members to provide penny stock purchasers with infor­mation
                      on the compensation to be earned by both the member and the registered repre­sentative as the
                      result of the transaction. This is to prevent excessive markups.

                                        Rule 15g-6 requires members to provide penny stock purchasers with monthly state­ments
                                        showing the estimated market value of each penny stock purchased. As we will learn in Unit

                                        Rule 15g-9 addresses sales practices to curb abusive sales practices. This rule requires members
                                        who are soliciting new customers to make a suitability determination. The member must
                                        inquire as to the prospective customer’s income, net worth, objectives, and risk tolerance.
                                        A suitability statement is prepared using this information. This suitability statement shows
                                        why the proposed penny stock trade is suitable for the customer. The member firm sends the
                                        statement to the customer for a signature. Once returned, trading in penny stocks may take
                                        place.


                                        Established Customer Exception
                                        A member may solicit an established customer without having to prepare a suit­ability
                                        statement. An established customer is one who has
                                         effected a nonpenny stock transaction or made a deposit of funds or securities in an
                                          account more than one year before the proposed penny stock trade; or
                                         made three unsolicited purchases of penny stocks, on three separate days, involving
                                          three separate issues. Once a customer buys three different penny stocks, he is no longer
                                          covered by the suitability statement requirement.

                                        In addition, the suitability statement does not apply to any customer turning in an unsolicited
                                        order to trade a penny stock. These customers initiate the trade without the firm making a
                                        penny stock recommendation.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   10. Under SEC rules, for an unlisted non-Nasdaq stock to avoid being defined as a penny
                                                       stock, it must have a market price of at least
                                                         A. $1 per share.
                                                         B. $2 per share.
                                                         C. $2.50 per share.
                                                        D. $5 per share.
                                                       Answer: D. SEC rules define penny stock as a non-Nasdaq stock with a market price
                                                       of less than $5 per share.


                                        Fair Prices and Commissions (FINRA Rule 2121)
                                        Rule 2121, also known as the 5% policy, was adopted to ensure that the investing public
                                        receives fair treatment and is charged reasonable rates for brokerage services. It is considered
                                        a guideline—not a firm rule. Test questions try to trap students into thinking that the rule
                                        mandates markups or commissions of 5% or less. That is not true. Charges of more than 5%
                                        can be reasonable. This would be the case with the thinly traded securities we have discussed.
                                        On the other hand, there are cases where a charge of less than 5% would be unfair. The point
                                        is, disregard the number 5%—it is simply the name of the policy.

                      Application of the 5% Policy
                      The policy applies to transactions in equity securities. It applies in both the OTC and the
                      exchange markets. It applies when customers buy or sell securities. It does not apply to pro­
                      spectus offerings. If a member must give a customer a prospectus in any transaction, that
                      transaction is outside the scope of the 5% policy (e.g., new issues, mutual funds, variable
                      annuities, and DPPs). In Unit 13, we will cover the nuts and bolts of the policy.

                                TAKE NOTE
                                Later in the course, we will cover the rules regarding registering a security for sale. In
                                the case of new issues, the document used to disclose the pertinent information is the
                                prospectus.

                                The 5% policy applies to both principal (dealer) and agency (broker) transactions.
                                It applies to markups, markdowns, and commissions, but not to securities sold by

              INTRODUCTION
                         The term debt security means a document that creates or evidences a debt obligation. The
                         most common example on the exam is a bond. There are other debt securities, such as money
                         market instruments. We will cover those as well. As we go through the units, we will discuss the
                         different entities that issue bonds. There are three major issuers of debt securities. The largest
                         issuer of debt securities is the U.S. government. Corporations borrow money to finance their
                         operations. State governments and those political entities that are subdivisions of a state, such as
                         cities, counties, towns, and so forth, also borrow substantial sums. These issues from state and
                         local political entities are municipal securities.

                         We will cover the general similarities in this unit. In the units to follow, we will get into the
                         many differences.

           LESSON 4.1: WHAT IS A DEBT SECURITY?
                                        LO 4.a Recognize the different types of debt securities.

                                        Let us begin this adventure by explaining the different types of debt securities.


                                        Bonds
                                        Debt capital represents money loaned to an issuer by investors purchasing that issuer’s bonds.
                                        A bond represents the issuer’s indebtedness. There is, in essence, a contract between the
                                        borrower (the issuer) and the lender (the investor). The terms of the loan are expressed in
                                        a document known as the bond’s indenture. The indenture, sometimes also referred to as
                                        the deed of trust, states the issuer’s obligation to pay back a specific amount of money on a
                                        specific date. The indenture also states the issuer’s obligation to pay the investor a specific rate
                                        of interest for the use of the funds as well as any collateral pledged as security for the loan
                                        and all other pertinent details. An investor purchasing a bond is lending the issuer money
                                        for a set period at a fixed annual interest rate. That rate is frequently referred to as the coupon
                                        rate because, years ago, bonds were issued with detachable coupons that were presented for
                                        collection of the interest. That is no longer the case, but the term coupon is still in common
                                        use. This rate is generally called the nominal yield on the exam. Once set, it never changes
                                        during the life of the bond. This is why bonds are the classic fixed-income investment.

                                        It is important to understand that debt capital refers to long-term debt financing. Long-term
                                        debt is money borrowed for a minimum of five years, although more frequently, the length of
                                        time is 20–30 years.


                                        Money Market Instruments
                                        We define the money market as the market for buying and selling short-term loanable funds
                                        in the form of securities and loans. It is called the money market because that is what is traded
                                        there—money, not cash. The buyer of a money market instrument is the lender of the money;
                                        the seller of a money market instrument is the entity borrowing the money. In general, money
                                        market securities are of high quality (low risk). Because of their safety and high liquidity, their
                                        yields are low.

                                        Although there are many different kinds of money market instruments, there are several
                                        common factors. For example, they all have a maturity date of one year or less. In fact, most
                                        money market instruments mature in less than six months. Another factor that most (but
                                        not all) money market instruments share is that they are issued at a discount; they do not
                                        pay interest. The principal amount of the loan is repaid at maturity. Because most money
                                        market instruments have a maturity of six months or less, the administrative costs of paying
                                        out interest would be very high. Therefore, the solution is to issue the security at a discount
                                        with the investor getting back par at maturity. The difference between the price paid and the
                                        maturity value is considered interest. Think of interest as rent for the use of borrowed money.

                                        Money market instruments are safe. Some are not quite as safe as others are (e.g., commercial
                                        paper is not as safe as a Treasury bill). Institutions, including banks, insurance companies,
                                        and money market mutual funds are the primary purchasers of money market securities. The
                                        minimum denominations are generally too high for most individual investors. Industry best
                                        practices recommend the use of delivery versus payment (DVP) on the purchase of these
                                        securities.

                      LO 4.b Name the characteristics common to most debt securities.

                      Regardless of the type of debt issue, there are certain characteristics that are common to all of
                      them.


                      Inverse Relationship Between Interest Rate and the Price of Debt
                      Securities
                      In Lesson 3.2, we mentioned that the market price of preferred stock fluctuates inversely with
                      current interest rates. We did not explain why that is so. We waited for this unit because the
                      exam focuses on this concept with debt securities. Later on in the unit, when we discuss the
                      math behind yields, this topic will be easier to follow. At this point, we want you to know
                      that whenever interest rates in the market (the current cost of borrowing money) go up, the
                      price of outstanding debt securities goes down. Likewise, if interest rates fall, the price of
                      outstanding debt securities will rise. How much is something we will cover at yields.

                                TAKE NOTE
                                Although the market price of the debt security will fluctuate, the interest payments
                                stay the same.


                      Structure
                      There are certain structural components common to most debt securities.


                      Indenture
                      As mentioned above, the indenture is the legal document describing the legal conditions of
                      the bond. In the case of money market instruments, there is no indenture. A legal opinion
                      is usually used instead, but that is not a testable item. The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 deals
                      with corporate bonds. We will cover that act in the next unit.


                      Negotiability
                      Both bonds and money market securities are readily transferrable. This enables investors to sell             Unit 4
                      their security before maturity date. Secondary market trading is less common in the money
                      market because of the short maturities.


                      Specified Maturity Date
                      Debt securities are redeemed, (paid back), by the issuer on a specified maturity date. In the
                      case of money market instruments, that can be as short as one day. It is never longer than one
                      year. Bonds have longer maturities. Those can be as short as five years, but more often are
                      10–30 years.


                      Payment of Interest
                      In the case of bonds, interest is generally paid semiannually based on a stated coupon rate.
                      Money market instruments are issued at a discount to their face value with the difference paid
                      at maturity representing the interest. In Lesson 4.4 we will get into more detail on this.

                                        Accrued Interest
                                        What happens to an investor who sells a bond before the semiannual interest payment
                                        date? The buyer pays the seller the amount of interest that has accrued since the last interest
                                        payment. Then on the next payment date, the new owner receives the full six months of
                                        interest.

                                        Most bonds trade and pay interest, meaning a buyer pays a seller a bond’s market price, plus
                                        any accrued interest since the last interest payment. The buyer receives the full amount of the
                                        next interest payment, including interest that accrued while the seller owned the bond.

                                        Most bonds pay interest every six months on either the 1st or the 15th of the specified
                                        months. The payment dates are known as coupon dates. Accrued interest affects bond
                                        transactions when settlement occurs between coupon dates. Some examples of coupon dates
                                        follow.

             If the interest dates are:          The bonds are known as:
             January 1 and July 1                J&J bonds
             February 15 and August 15           F&A 15 bonds
             March 1 and September 1             M&S bonds
             April 1 and October 1               A&O bonds
             May 15 and November 15              M&N 15 bonds
             June 15 and December 15             J&D 15 bonds


                                                  TAKE NOTE
                                                  When payment dates within the month are not specified, always assume the first of
                                                  the month (e.g., J & J, assume January 1 and July 1).

                                        We will come back to this subject in detail in Unit 6.


                                        Paying Agent
                                        The paying agent is usually a trust department of a bank. In some cases, it could be the
                                        treasurer of the issuers. The role of the paying agent is to transmit payments of interest and
                                        principal to the investors. Because most money market instruments are issued at a discount,
                                        the paying agent only repays the principal.


                                        Pricing (Quotes)
                                        In most cases, bonds are quoted as a percentage of par or face value. A quote of 100 means the
                                        bond is selling at 100% of its par, or $1,000. Sometimes bonds are selling for a price above
                                        par (we will show you why in Lesson 4.4) and sometimes at a price below par. A bond quoted
                                        at 120 is trading at 120% of $1,000, or $1,200. A bond quoted at 80 is trading at 80% of
                                        par, or $800. There are some differences between the way quotes for corporate, municipal, and
                                        U.S. Treasury bonds are shown. Those will be explained in the relevant units.


                                        Trustee
                                        The trustee is usually a financial institution, such as a trust company. The trustee represents
                                        the investors. Making sure the borrower lives up to the terms of the loan is the responsibility
                                        of the trustee. The trustee often serves as the paying agent.

                                                                                               Unit 4   Debt Securities       99


                      Secured or Unsecured
                      An issuer of a debt security may choose to place specific assets as collateral for the loan. That
                      generally adds to the safety of the security as it is now considered secured. In other cases, there
                      is no specific asset pledged and the loan is strictly on the credit standing of the issuer.


                      Callable or Noncallable
                      Bonds can be either callable or noncallable. The call feature permits the issuer to redeem
                      its bonds (pay off the principal) before maturity if it so desires. The call feature is most
                      often exercised when interest rates (borrowing costs) have declined. In this case, the issuer
                      could take advantage of the lower cost of borrowing by issuing new bonds at the lower rate
                      prevailing in the market and using those proceeds to call in the old bonds with their higher
                      coupons. This is similar to refinancing a home mortgage, but in this industry, we use the term
                      refunding. An issuer would not be interested in redeeming its bonds when interest rates have
                      gone up and the bond prices have gone down; the cheapest way for the issuer to retire its debt
                      is to buy it in the open market.

                      Realistically, that doesn’t often work, so the issuer invokes the call provision. In this case, the
                      issuer employs an “in whole call.” That is, the entire issue is called. In other cases, the issuer
                      might have surplus funds. Rather than pay interest on the debt, it will call in a portion of
                      the bonds (a partial call). When this is done, the bonds to be called are usually selected in a
                      random draw. A partial call is comparable to an individual using some extra money to pay
                      down credit card debt. There is not enough to pay the entire balance, but paying off a portion
                      certainly saves money. More than likely, you would first pay down the accounts carrying the
                      highest interest cost. If the issuer has several callable bonds outstanding, it would do the same
                      thing. That is, it would call the issue with the highest coupons first.

                      Because of their short-term nature, it is rare to see a callable money market instrument.


                      Call Protection
                      Before purchasing a bond, determine the extent of its call protection. Call protection is the
                      number of years into the issue before the issuer may exercise the call provision. The best call
                      protection a bond may have is if a bond is noncallable; in other words, the issuer cannot call it
                      early, and the investor has the best protection against a call.

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION                                                                                    Unit 4
                                 1.   A bond issue that may be retired in advance of maturity at the option of the issuer is
                                      said to have
                                       A. a callable feature.
                                       B. an optional reserve.
                                       C. a conversion feature.
                                       D. a cumulative feature.
                                      Answer: A. A bond that is callable has a provision that the issuer, at its option, may
                                      redeem that bond at a specified price known as the call or redemption price. As
                                      we will see later, it is the investor who can exercise the conversion feature—not the
                                      issuer.


                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 When the issuer calls the bond, the investors tender (sell back) their bonds at the call
                                 price.

           LESSON 4.2: THE MONEY MARKET
                                        LO 4.c Examine the different types of money-market instruments.



                                        Types of Money Market Instruments
                                        There are a number of different types of money market instruments. We have discussed the
                                        common elements in the previous lesson. Now it is time to drill down into the specifics.


                                        U.S. Treasury Bills
                                        The safest money market security is the Treasury Bill (T-bill). At the time of this printing,
                                        they are available in maturities of 4, 8, 13, 26, and 52 weeks. That can change, but what won’t
                                        change is that they are never longer than 52 weeks. No security is as safe as a T-bill. In fact,
                                        later in the course, you will learn that the example of a risk-free investment is the 13 week
                                        (91 day) T-bill. These are always issued at a discount from the face value. We will discuss the
                                        features of the T-bill in Unit 7.


                                        Commercial Paper (CP)
                                        Commercial paper (CP) is short-term unsecured paper issued by corporations (especially
                                        finance companies) sold in blocks of $100,000, primarily to raise working capital. In other
                                        words, for current needs rather than long-term needs. The issuers of CP are usually companies
                                        with excellent credit ratings. It is possible you will see CP referred to as a promissory note. It
                                        is, after all, a promise by the issuer to repay the principal at the end of the term. In Unit 6, we
                                        will learn that municipalities sometimes issue CP. CP maturities range from one to 270 days,
                                        although most mature within 90 days. These are always issued at a discount from the face
                                        value.


                                        Negotiable Certificate of Deposit (CD)
                                        Please do not confuse a negotiable certificate of deposit (CD) with the non-negotiable CDs
                                        you can buy at your local bank. The exam will frequently call these jumbo CDs. This is
                                        an appropriate title because the minimum size is $100,000. The most common size is $1
                                        million, and they can be more than that. These CDs are unsecured time deposits (no asset of
                                        the bank is pledged as collateral), and the money is being loaned to the bank for a specified
                                        period. Negotiable means readily transferrable. A negotiable CD allows the initial investor, or
                                        any subsequent owner of the CD, to sell the CD in the open market before maturity date.
                                        Unlike the CD at your bank branch, there is no prepayment penalty. The bank that issues the
                                        CD redeems the CD at face value plus interest on maturity date. CDs are the only money
                                        market instrument issued at face value (not a discount) and that pays periodic interest, usually
                                        semiannually. Although maturities can run as long as 10 years, only those with a maturity of
                                        one year or less are considered money market instruments. FDIC insurance covers these CDs
                                        just as any other bank deposit.

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   Be careful. Jumbo CDs are insured (up to the FDIC limit of $250,000), but they are not
                                                   secured by any bank asset.

                                                                                              Unit 4   Debt Securities     101


                       Brokered CDs
                       As the name implies, broker-dealers sell these. Brokered CDs generally have a longer holding
                       period than the jumbo money market CDs we just discussed. Therefore, they are not part of
                       the money market. The structure of these is such that they are generally more complex than
                       regular bank (not jumbo) issued CDs. There are other important differences, such as the
                       following:
                        The commission or fees to buy brokered CDs are generally higher than bank issued ones.
                        These may or may not be covered by FDIC insurance. The details are beyond the exam,
                         but the concept is not.

                       Unlike a bank CD where the bank will redeem at face value at any time (there may be a
                       penalty), brokered CDs are usually not redeemable before maturity. The broker-dealer offering
                       the CD may buy it back. There would likely be fees and no assurance that the investor will
                       receive maturity value.


                       Bankers’ Acceptances (BAs)
                       Certain corporations in the import-export business will often use bankers’ acceptances (BAs)
                       as a short-term time draft with a specified payment date drawn on a bank. BAs are essentially
                       a postdated check or line of credit. The payment date of a BA is normally between one and
                       180 days and never more than 270 days.

                       The bank on which the instrument is drawn stamps the word accepted across the face of the
                       draft. In doing so, the bank accepts the responsibility to make payment upon maturity. This is
                       true whether or not the customer for which the acceptance was initiated has repaid the bank.
                       This acceptance, or bank liability, makes the instrument a very marketable instrument. These
                       are always issued at a discount from the face value.

                       U.S. corporations use bankers’ acceptances extensively to finance international trade—that is,
                       a BA typically pays for goods and services in a foreign country. You might see these referred to
                       as a bill of exchange or a letter of credit (LOC).


                       Repurchase Agreements (Repo)
                       A repurchase agreement (repo) is the sale of securities with an agreement to repurchase
                                                                                                                                     Unit 4
                       them at a higher price on an agreed upon future date. Overnight repos are those where the
                       repurchase date is the next day. The difference between the sale price and the repurchase price
                       represents the interest earned by the investor. That means these are always purchased at a
                       discount. Repos trade as money market instruments. The security that is exchanged stands as
                       collateral for the loan advanced to the seller. The most common collateral behind a repo is a
                       Treasury security.


                       Reverse Repo
                       A reverse repo is the reverse of a repurchase agreement. In this case, the purchaser, not the
                       seller, initiates the deal. This is a purchase of securities with an attendant agreement to resell
                       them at a higher price on an agreed upon future date; the difference between the purchase
                       price and the resale price represents the interest earned by the investor.

                       It is likely that the exam’s only questions on repos/reverse repos will be about them being
                       money market securities.

           102         Unit 4   Debt Securities



           LESSON 4.3: FOREIGN DEBT SECURITIES
                                         LO 4.d Identify types and characteristics of non-U.S. market debt securities.

                                         Expect the exam to focus on debt instruments of U.S. issuers. However, there may be a
                                         question on debt issues from foreign entities.


                                         Sovereign Debt Securities
                                         The term sovereign debt applies to securities issued by national governments. In the United
                                         States, Treasury securities are the example. Probably the best known of the foreign government
                                         bonds are the Gilts issued in the United Kingdom. They got that name because the original
                                         certificates had a gilded edge. The sovereign bonds issued by Germany are the Bunds, and in
                                         France, they are the OATs.

                                         None of these names will appear on your exam. What you do have to know is that the safety
                                         of a sovereign bond depends on the economy of the issuing country. It is not unheard of for a
                                         government to default on its bonds. Russia did in 1998. Argentina did in 2001. In fact, there
                                         have been many cases, starting with France in 1558. On the other hand, there are countries
                                         where there has never been a default and, at least for the near term, one is unlikely. One risk,
                                         unrelated to the ability of the issuer to pay, is currency risk. We will cover that in Unit 14.


                                         Foreign Corporate Debt Securities
                                         Foreign corporations issue debt securities in a manner similar to that of U.S.-based
                                         corporations. It is unusual to find foreign sovereign and corporate debt issues in the same
                                         portfolio of individual investors. Institutions are the most frequent purchasers of these
                                         securities. Individuals wishing foreign exposure typically do so through mutual funds and/or
                                         exchange-traded funds (ETFs). We will discuss those in Unit 8. Following are some terms you
                                         might see on the exam.


                                         Eurobond
                                         A Eurobond is any long-term debt instrument issued and sold outside the country of
                                         the currency in which it is denominated. For example, if a Swiss company issued bonds
                                         denominated in British pounds, it is a Eurobond. If the government of France issued bonds
                                         denominated in Japanese yen, it is still a Eurobond.


                                         Eurodollar Bond
                                         A U.S. dollar-denominated Eurobond, or Eurodollar bond, is a bond issued by a corporation
                                         (or government), sold outside the United States and the issuer’s country, but for which the
                                         principal and interest are stated and paid in U.S. dollars. The U.S. government does not issue
                                         Eurodollar bonds. These bonds are not limited to European issuers; that is just where they
                                         originated. For example, if an Indian bank held dollar-denominated bonds issued by a Korean
                                         company, the term Eurodollar bond would still apply.

                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                    Test questions sometimes ask you to contrast Eurobonds and Eurodollar bonds. The
                                    name of the instrument tells you how principal and interest is paid. Eurodollar bonds
                                    pay in U.S. dollars; Eurobonds pay in foreign currency. Note that these instruments
                                    must be issued outside of the United States.
                          It is unlikely you will have to know the cute names for bonds issued outside their country but
                          in the country’s currency. Maple bonds are those issued in Canadian currency and Matilda
                          bonds are those issued in Australian currency. The primary reason for issuing these bonds is
                          that they are free from the requirement to register with the SEC, resulting in lower issuance
                          costs. Because the liquidity is not as great as with U.S. domestic issues and because the
                          political and country risks tend to be higher, yields are generally higher.


              LESSON 4.4: BOND YIELDS
                          LO 4.e Compute the different yields relating to debt securities.



                          Bond Math
                          Please do not be frightened by that word, math. We are not talking trigonometry, geometry,
                          or calculus. For the most part, you learned all of the arithmetic needed for this lesson before
                          you left middle school. This lesson is all about the returns offered by debt securities. The
                          primary source of return is the income from the interest payments. There are also cases where
                          the investor might sell the security for a profit. When that happens, the investor’s yield is
                          increased.


                          Nominal Yield
                          The interest rate on a bond is always shown on the bond certificate as a percentage of the
                          par value. That interest stated on the face of the bond is the nominal yield. Sometimes it is
                          referred to as the coupon rate. To compute the annual interest payments in dollars, multiply
                          this nominal yield by the face amount of the bond ($1,000 unless stated otherwise). A bond
                          with a 5% coupon rate pays $50 per year. One with an 8% nominal yield pays $80 per year.
                          One with a coupon of 13.5% pays $135 per year. Because, on any particular bond, this
                                                                                                                                      Unit 4
                          interest payment is the same every year, we refer to bonds as fixed-income investments.

                          For exam purposes, unless the question says something different, the par value of all bonds is
                          $1,000 and the interest is paid semiannually (every six months).

                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                    When a question states a bond pays interest at a rate of 6% semiannually, it does not
                                    mean two payments of $60 per year. The interest rate is always stated on an annual
                                    basis ($60 per year), and it is paid twice per year, $30 every six months.

                                         Current Yield (CY)
                                         Investors always want to know the return on their investments. The most straightforward way
                                         to do that is to place the return on the investment as follows.

                                                    return
                                                  investment
                                         The return will always be the annual interest in dollars (if referring to a stock, the dividend in
                                         dollars) divided by the current market price (the amount of investment required to own the
                                         security). This calculation is called current yield (CY) or current return.

                                         As we have stated, the face or par value of all bonds is $1,000. However, bond prices fluctuate
                                         in the secondary markets. The nominal rate is the interest rate a bond pays. How does that
                                         work? Look at this example.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     The DBL 10s of ’39. DBL is the name of the issuer, 10s means the nominal yield is 10%,
                                                     and ’39 means that the bonds mature in 2039. The letter s is added because it is easier
                                                     to say “the 10s” than to say “the 10.” These bonds pay $100 a year ($50 semiannually)
                                                     for each $1,000 of face value. Regardless of what the market price of the bonds may be,
                                                     DBL has an obligation to pay annual interest of 10% of the $1,000 face it borrowed.
                                                     If an investor were to buy these bonds for more than $1,000 or less than $1,000, the
                                                     return on the investment would not be 10%. For example, if these bonds had a current
                                                     market value of $800, their CY would be 12.5% ($100 ÷ $800). Similarly, someone
                                                     paying $1,200 for the bonds would receive a CY of 8.33% ($100 ÷ $1,200). Please notice,
                                                     the $100 interest received is the same in all cases regardless of the current market
                                                     price.
                                                     Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions; as interest rates rise, bond prices
                                                     fall and vice versa. When a bond trades at a discount, its CY increases; when it trades at
                                                     a premium, its CY decreases.


                                         Discount and Premium
                                         When a bond is selling at a price above par (or face), it is selling at a premium. When it is
                                         selling below par, it is selling at a discount. Remember these critical statements:
                                          If you pay more, you get less.
                                          If you pay less, you get more.
                                         An investor buying a bond at a premium will always receive a rate of return less than the
                                         coupon (or nominal) yield stated on the face of the bond. As we saw in the earlier example,
                                         8.33% is less than 10%. Conversely, any time an investor purchases a bond at a discount, the
                                         return will be more than the rate stated on the face of the bond (12.5% is greater than 10%).

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     Just think of this as going shopping. The bigger the discount, the lower the price of
                                                     the item. On the other hand, the bigger the discount, the more you are getting for your
                                                     money. It is the same concept here.
                                         There is another important fact to know about the par value—the amount of the loan that

                       in addition to the interest. An investor purchasing a bond at a premium and holding it until
                       the maturity date knows that the par value received will be less than her purchase price for the
                       bond. That means that the total interest received is offset by a loss. We reflect this gain or loss
                       that an investor will have at maturity by looking at another yield. This is the yield to maturity,
                       or true yield.

                                  The exam may give you a quoted yield and ask you for the price relative to par. For
                                  example, if a bond with a 5% coupon is currently yielding 6%, is it selling at a discount,
                                  a premium, or par? Well, anytime you are getting a yield higher than the coupon rate,
                                  the bond has to be selling at a discount from par. Conversely, if the bond had a 5%
                                  coupon, but the current return was 4%, the bond must be selling at a premium to par.
                                  Remember, if you pay more, you get less, and if you pay less, you get more.

                                  One bond that is always traded at a discount is the zero coupon bond. You would see
                                  them quoted as: BCD Zr 36 @ 6.45%. BCD is the issuer, Zr is the coupon (zero), 2036 is
                                  the maturity date, and the yield to maturity (basis) is 6.45%.


                       Yield to Maturity (Basis)
                       This measurement takes into account the gain or loss the investor will have when the bonds
                       are redeemed at maturity. The person who was mentioned earlier who buys the bonds at $800
                       will get back $1,000 if the bonds are held to maturity, in addition to receiving $100 per year
                       interest (a CY of 12.5% on the $800 investment). Consequently, this investor will have a gain
                       of $200 on top of the annual interest. The individual paying $1,200 for the bonds will have a
                       $200 loss at maturity when receiving the face value for them at maturity.

                       Whenever an investor pays less (buys at a discount), there will be a profit in addition to the
                       annual interest, and whenever the investor pays more (buys at a premium), there will be a loss
                       if held to maturity. Try to understand these key facts:
                        A bond is issued at par ($1,000) because that is how much the issuer is borrowing.
                        The interest paid on the bond is always fixed as a percentage of the par (face) value.
                        Regardless of changes in the market value of the bond, the interest checks remain the                         Unit 4
                         same.
                        The current market price of a bond is determined by supply and demand.
                        The current market price will fluctuate.
                        The current market price may be at par, above par, or below par.
                        A bond always matures at par.
                        Purchasing a bond at par will always result in getting back the same as the original
                         investment at maturity.
                        Purchasing a bond at a discount (below par) will always result in getting back par, which
                         means more (a profit) than the original investment.
                        Purchasing a bond at a premium (above par) will always result in getting back par, which
                         means less (a loss) than the original investment.

                                         Although you will probably not have to do a yield to maturity computation on the exam,
                                         some students find that seeing the numbers played out gives them a better understanding of
                                         the concept. Try to follow this example.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   An investor who buys a 10% coupon bond at 105 ($1,050 per bond) with 10 years
                                                   remaining to maturity can expect $100 in interest per year. If he holds the bond to
                                                   maturity, the bondholder loses $50, the amount of the premium. This loss is included
                                                   in the yield to maturity (YTM) approximation.
                                                   The actual YTM calculation for this premium bond is shown below:
                                                         annual interest – (premium ÷ years to maturity)
                                                                  average price of the bond
                                                   A bond’s average price is the price paid plus the amount received at maturity (par)
                                                   divided by two. Alternatively, the average price is the price midway between the
                                                   purchase price and par.
                                                        100 − (50 ÷ 10)      95
                                                                        =           = 0.093, or 9.3%
                                                            1,025           1,025
                                                   The YTM of a bond bought at a premium is always lower than both the coupon rate
                                                   (nominal yield) and the CY. In this example, the nominal yield is 10%, and the CY is
                                                   9.52% (100 ÷ 1,050).
                                                   If an investor buys a 10-year bond with a 10% coupon for 95 ($950 per bond), he
                                                   receives $100 per year in coupon interest payments and a gain of $50 (the amount of
                                                   the discount) at maturity. This gain is included in the YTM approximation.
                                                   The actual YTM calculation for this discount bond is shown below:
                                                        annual interest + (discount ÷ years to maturity)
                                                                 average price of the bond

                                                        100 + (50 ÷ 10)      105
                                                                        =           = 0.1077, or 10.77%
                                                             975             975
                                                   The YTM of a bond bought at a discount is always higher than both the coupon rate
                                                   (nominal yield) and the CY. In this example, the nominal yield is 10%, and the CY is
                                                   10.53% (100 ÷ 950).
                                                   If these calculations seem complicated, do not worry. You will have at most one
                                                   question requiring a YTM calculation. Focus on the relationship between YTM and
                                                   CY based on the price of the bond.


                                         Yield to Call
                                         A bond with a call feature may be redeemed before maturity at the issuer’s option. The call
                                         price may be at par or at a premium. You will never see a bond called at a discount from par.
                                         Calling a bond makes the call date, in effect, the maturity date.

                                         A bond’s yield to call, similar to YTM, is the rate of return the bond provides from the
                                         purchase date to the call date and price. When the bond is selling at a premium, this
                                         calculation generates a lower return than does the YTM. That is why call protection is so
                                         important when a callable bond is trading at a premium.

                       TEST TOPIC ALERT
                       The reason why we’ve only referred to a bond selling at a premium being called for
                       redemption is that it is highly unlikely that an issuer would call in a bond that was
                       available in the marketplace at a discount. After all, if the issuer could pay less than
                       $1,000 to buy back the debt, why would they issue a call at par or higher?
                       The following example and chart will help you follow the discussion of the various
                       bond yields.

                       1.   What is the current yield of a 6% bond trading for 80 ($800)?
                             Current yield = annual income / current market price
                             Find the solution as follows: $60 / $800 = 7.5%. This bond is trading at a
                             discount. When prices fall, yields rise. The current yield is greater than the
                             nominal yield when bonds are trading at a discount.
                       2.   What is the current yield of a 6% bond trading for 120 ($1,200)?
                             Find the solution as follows: $60 / $1,200 = 5%. This bond is trading at a
                             premium. The price is up so the yield is down. The current yield is less than the
                             nominal yield when bonds are trading at a premium.
                             It is critical to understand the inverse relationship between price and yield. An
                             effective way to visualize it is through the chart. When bonds are at par, coupon
                             and current yield are equal. When bonds are at a premium, the CY is less than
                             the coupon. When bonds are at a discount, the CY is greater than the coupon.

                                                  Know how to calculate the CY of a bond or a stock. Expect to see one question on the
                                                  calculation of CY.
                                                  The CY of common stock is calculated by dividing the current dividend by the current
                                                  price of the stock. For instance, a stock with a $2 dividend trading on the market for
                                                  $40 has a 5% CY ($2 / $40 = 5%).

                                                  EXAMPLE
                                                  Answer the following questions with premium, par, or discount.
                                                  1.   If the bond has a YTC lower than its CY, it is trading at
                                                  2.   If the bond has a YTM and CY that are equal, the bond is trading at
                                                  3.   If the bond has a YTM less than its YTC, the bond is trading at
                                                  4.   If a bond has a YTM greater than its coupon, the bond is trading at
                                                  The answers are: 1. premium; 2. par; 3. discount; and 4. discount.

                                 Once you understand the yield ranking for discounts, the ranking for premium is
                                 easy—it is the exact opposite.


                       Price/Yield Relationship
                       There are many reasons interest rates rise and fall. The main concern for the exam, at this
                       point, is the effect that interest rates have on the price fluctuations of bonds. As a rule, keep
                       in mind that interest rates and bond prices move counter to each other. That is, when interest
                       rates are going up, the price of older bonds will be going down. When interest rates are going
                       down, the price of older bonds will be going up.

                       When most people hear this for the first time, they have difficulty understanding it. Simply
                       stated, when newly issued bonds are paying a higher rate of interest than ones currently in the
                       marketplace, those older bonds are not as attractive. After all, if a new bond came out with a
                       6% coupon, your 4% or 5% bond would not be as valuable (this always assumes equal quality
                       or rating). Conversely, if you were holding a bond with an 8% coupon, and newly issued
                       bonds were only offering 6%, your bond is more valuable.

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 2.     When a bond with a 6% coupon is selling for 90, each of the following statements is
                                        correct except
                                         A. the current yield (CY) is approximately 6.67%.
                                         B. the bond is selling at a discount.
                                         C. the bondholder will receive two semiannual interest payments of $27 each.
                                         D. the yield to maturity is slightly higher than the current yield (CY).
                                        Answer: C. A bond with a 6% coupon is going to make two semiannual interest
                                                                                                                                         Unit 4
                                        payments of $30 each, regardless of the bond’s market price. After all, the loan was
                                        $1,000 at 6% interest and that will not change. A price of 90 is 90% of the $1,000
                                        par—clearly a discount. The CY is the $60 annual interest divided by the $900 price or
                                        6.67%. That is a bit lower than the yield to maturity. Remember, if we hold the bond
                                        to maturity, we are going to get back the full $1,000. That will represent a $100 profit.
                                        Please see the earlier chart at the Test Topic Alert.


                       Duration
                       In Lesson 4.2, we mentioned that debt securities pay interest. There are two ways. All money
                       market instruments, other than CDs, pay that “interest” through receiving the discount back
                       at maturity. All bonds, with the exception of zero coupon bonds, pay semiannual interest.

                       In the financial industry, the term duration is used to measure the sensitivity of a debt security
                       when interest rates change in the marketplace. It is a complicated computation, but, to try
                       to simplify things, it is basically a measurement of the time it takes for the cash flow (interest

                                         payments) to repay the invested principal. The general rule is, the higher the coupon rate, the
                                         shorter the duration, and the lower the coupon, the longer the duration.

                                         The longer the duration, the greater the market price movement, and vice versa. Long
                                         duration debt securities have greater interest rate risk than those with a short duration.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   Coupon rate is the common term for the stated interest rate paid on a bond. A bond
                                                   with 5% coupon is paying 5% of $1,000, or $50 per year. If it is a zero coupon bond,
                                                   the stated interest rate is 0%. Who would lend $1,000 for 10 or more years without
                                                   receiving any interest? I don’t know any investors who would take that deal. The
                                                   issuers of these bonds understand that so the bonds are issued at a significant
                                                   discount from par. Similar to the money market instruments covered in a previous
                                                   lesson, the investor receives the $1,000 face value at maturity. The difference between
                                                   the purchase price, which could be as low as $300 or $400, and the maturity value is
                                                   considered the “rent” (interest) for the use of the borrowed money.
                                         The simplest duration question deals with a zero coupon bond. They are issued at a discount
                                         and mature at par. Their measured duration is always equal to the length to maturity. On
                                         the other hand, the duration of an interest-paying bond is always shorter than the time to its
                                         maturity. This is because the interest payments can be reinvested and earn additional interest.
                                         Zeroes will be covered in more detail in the next unit.

                                         There are two components to the computation: the interest rate and the maturity date. If the
                                         maturity dates are about the same (the difference between a 20-year maturity and a 22-year
                                         one is almost insignificant), then the bond paying the highest coupon rate will always have
                                         the shortest duration and that with the lowest coupon, the longest. However, if the coupon
                                         rates are approximately the same, then the bond that will mature first will have the shortest
                                         duration, and the one that will mature last will have the longest duration.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   One way to keep things straight is to think about the zero coupon bond. With no
                                                   periodic interest payments, the duration of a zero coupon bond will always equal its
                                                   length to maturity. In other words, if we’re trying to compute how long it will take for
                                                   the income payments to return your principal, without any interest payments, you
                                                   can’t expect to get your money back until maturity date. If that is the case with a zero
                                                   coupon bond, then as we find bonds paying interest, the more they’re paying every six
                                                   months, the quicker the payback.

                                                   The general characteristics of duration follow:
                                                       The lower the coupon rate, the longer a bond’s duration; the higher the coupon
                                                        rate, the shorter the duration.

                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                   3.   When a bond paying interest at the rate of $80 per year is quoted at 110, which of the
                                        following statements is correct?
                                          A. The nominal yield is lower than the coupon rate.
                                          B. The coupon rate is lower than the nominal yield.
                                          C. The current yield (CY) is higher than the yield to maturity.
                                         D. The yield to maturity is approximately 7.27%.
                                        Answer: C. The nominal yield and the coupon rate mean the same thing. In this
                                        case, it is 8% ($80 interest on a $1,000 bond is 8%). Therefore, choices A and B
                                        cannot be correct. The CY is the $80 in interest divided by the current price of $1,100.
                                        Remember, the quote of 110 means 110% of $1,000. That computes to 7.27%. That
                                        must be higher than the yield to maturity. This bond is selling at a premium. At
                                        maturity, an investor who bought this bond will only get back the par value. That
                                        means a loss of $100 has to be part of the computation. That loss will make the YTM
                                        less than the CY. And, one more thing. Choice D could not be correct because we are
                                        missing a critical ingredient of YTM—the maturity date. Without knowing the number
                                        of years to maturity, we can’t do the computation.


              LESSON 4.5: THE RATINGS GAME

                         LO 4.f Recognize the relevance of a bond’s rating.



                         Bond Ratings
                         The purchase of a debt security is only as safe as the strength of the borrower. That strength
                         can be enhanced if the loan has collateral. Because safety of the bond will frequently be a
                         very important consideration for clients, most investors consult the rating services. There
                         are a number of different rating organizations. The following Take Note describes the ones
                         recognized by the SEC.

                                   TAKE NOTE
                                   There are seven ratings firms registered with the SEC. They are
                                       A.M. Best Co., Inc., (historically associated with rating insurance companies’ ability
                                        to pay claims and their debt issues);                                                            Unit 4
                                       DBRS, Ltd.;
                                       Fitch Ratings, Inc.;
                                       Japan Credit Rating Agency, Ltd.;
                                       Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.;
                                       Rating and Investment Information, Inc.; and
                                       Standard and Poor’s (S&P) Rating Service.
                         The most important rating organizations for the exam are S&P and Moody’s. Both
                         organizations have highly qualified personnel who analyze all the details of the debt issue and
                         arrive at a letter rating indicating their opinion of the debt’s quality (safety). The following
                         chart should give you all the information you need for the exam.

                                                    4.   According to Standard and Poor’s (S&P) rating system, the four highest grades of
                                                         bonds (from best to lowest grade) are

                                                          C. B, A, AA, AAA.
                                                          D. AAA, AA, A, BBB.
                                                         Answer: D. Choice A would be correct if the question referred to Moody’s.


                                         Investment-Grade Debt
                                         In the industry, bonds rated in the top four categories (BBB or Baa and higher) are referred
                                         to as investment grade. Investment-grade bonds are generally the only quality eligible for
                                         purchase by the institutions (e.g., banks or insurance companies) and by fiduciaries and
                                         therefore have greater liquidity than lower-grade instruments.

                                         This is where the risk/reward concept comes into play. All other things equal, the higher the
                                         rating, the lower the yield. Think of these ratings as your personal credit score. When your
                                         score is 800, it is easy to borrow money. The rate you will be charged for the loan will be
                                         lower than for someone whose score is 600. The concept is, if the lender is going to have to

                          take more risk that payments will not be made on time, there has to be a greater reward. That
                          reward is in the form of a higher interest charge.


                          High-Yield Bonds
                          Lower-grade bonds, known in the industry as junk bonds, are now more commonly called
                          high-yield bonds. Because of their lower ratings (BB or Ba or lower) and additional risk of
                          default, high-yield bonds may be subject to substantial price erosion during slow economic
                          times or when a bond issuer’s creditworthiness is questioned. Their volatility is usually
                          substantially higher than investment-grade bonds, but they may be suitable for sophisticated
                          investors seeking higher returns and possible capital appreciation from speculative fixed-
                          income investments.

                          Once again, think risk/reward. The less creditworthy the borrower, the more risk to the lender.
                          That requires a greater reward to the lender to compensate for that risk. That is why lower-
                          rated bonds carry higher rates of return.

                          It is important to understand that when the raters evaluate a bond they look at all the factors,
                          including collateral. A mortgage bond is not necessarily safer than any debenture.

                          Finally, not all bonds are rated. Does that mean the risks are enormous? Not necessarily.
                          The rating organizations rate those issues that either pay to be rated or have enough bonds
                          outstanding to generate constant investor interest. The fact that a bond is not rated does not
                          indicate its quality. Many issues are too small to justify the expense of a bond rating. In those
                          cases, investors have to do their homework.


                          Money Market Ratings
                          The rating system for money market instruments follows the same concept as for bonds. The
                          rating organizations attempt to measure the quality of the debt. As with bonds, the higher the
                          quality, the lower the financing cost.

                          When it comes to short-term municipal debt issues, you will need to know Moody’s, S&P,
                          and Fitch. Moody’s Investment Grade (MIG) short-term municipal note ratings are from
                          MIG 1 (best quality) through MIG 4 (adequate quality). If a note is speculative, it is listed as
                          SG. S&P rates notes as SP-1, SP-2, and SP-3. Fitch rates notes as F-1, F-2, and F-3.

                                                                                                                                      Unit 4
              LESSON 4.6: INVESTING IN ALTERNATIVE DEBT SECURITIES
                          LO 4.g Identify debt securities classified as alternative investments.



                          Types of Alternative Debt Financing
                          In the 1990s, financial advisers began introducing their wealthy clients to alternative
                          investments, now generally referred to as Alts. These included, among other products, ETNs,
                          leveraged ETFs, and new, highly sophisticated financial derivatives. They were often built
                          “from the ground up”—another way of saying they could be created to meet the needs of a
                          specific investor. That is why they are considered structured products. One thing that all of
                          these had in common was that they were complex and not easy to understand. This was true
                          for both the investor and the person recommending the investment.

                                         Although investing can be complex, standard investments are fairly easy to comprehend.
                                         Even new investors understand that stocks have more risk but hold out the chance of superior
                                         returns, while bonds generally have less risk with correspondingly lower returns. All investors
                                         dream of scoring a touchdown and not getting tackled for a loss. Alternative investments try
                                         to do just that. Some are successful, but many are not. Suitability determinations need to
                                         be made on a case-by-case basis considering each customer’s objectives, circumstances, and
                                         sophistication. Securities professionals must take special care in recommending these complex
                                         products to the sophisticated customer and even more so to one with less financial acumen.


                                         Equity-Linked Notes (ELNs)
                                         Equity-linked notes (ELNs) are debt instruments where the final payment at maturity is
                                         based on the return of a single stock, a basket of stocks, or an equity index. In the case where
                                         the note is based on the return of an index, the security would be known as an index-linked
                                         note. In the instances where the securities are traded on an exchange (most still are not), they
                                         are generally referred to as exchange-traded notes (ETNs). ELNs, exchange-traded or not,
                                         are considered alternative products with unique risks, and therefore, not suitable for most
                                         investors.

                                         Those risks, in part, include
                                          credit risk (ELNs/ETNs are unsecured debt obligations);
                                          market risk;

                                           discretion); and
                                          conflicts of interest [the issuer may engage in trading activities that are at odds with note
                                           holders (shorting, for instance)].

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   Don’t be fooled by the name equity-linked. These are debt securities, not equity.


                                         Private Placement Debt
                                         As the name implies, this money is loaned on a private basis. These securities are not
                                         registered with any regulatory body, such as the SEC. Because of the private nature, there
                                         are no ratings to guide investors. Although the borrower can be a company in any stage of
                                         operations, these are commonly used as mezzanine debt. Just as the mezzanine in a theater is
                                         between the bottom and top floors, this is money that is borrowed at an intermediate point in
                                         the company’s development. In general, the risks are high. That means the potential rewards
                                         are greater than just “leaving your money in the bank.” It is not unusual for the lenders to be
                                         repaid in stock instead of cash. If the company goes on to be a roaring success, it can mean
                                         enormous returns to the investors.


                                         Special Considerations
                                         When comparing alternative investments, debt or equity, to traditional ones, the following
                                         factors must be considered:
                                          Lack of regulation
                                          Low transparency

                        Low liquidity
                        High fees
                        Lack of historical data
                       With all of these negative risk factors, why lend money in this manner? In most cases, the
                       investors are institutions or highly sophisticated (and wealthy) individuals. They are willing to
                       take the risk for the higher potential rewards.

              INTRODUCTION
                         As we discussed in Unit 3, one way a corporation raises capital is by issuing equity securities—
                         stock. Another way is debt financing, primarily through the issuance of bonds and debentures.

                         Debt capital represents money loaned to a corporation by investors who buy the issuer’s debt
                         securities. The corporation is obligated to pay back a specific sum of money (the principal)
                         on a specific date (maturity). The corporation is also obligated to pay investors a stated rate of
                         interest for the use of their funds. When investors buy a bond, they are lending a corporation
                         money for a set length of time at a fixed annual interest rate.

                         As creditors, bondholders have several advantages. One advantage we will cover is the right of a
                         bondholder in a corporate liquidation. One way a corporation can make its debt security more
                         attractive is to add the convertible feature, just as we discussed with convertible preferred stock
                         in Unit 3. In this unit, we will go further into computing parity. Another area where equity
                         securities have an advantage is taxation, as we will discuss at the end of the unit.

           LESSON 5.1: TYPES OF CORPORATE BONDS
                                        LO5 a. Name the different types of corporate bonds.



                                        Types of Bonds Issued by Corporations
                                        Corporate debt securities, like any other loan, may be either secured or unsecured. Secured
                                        debt securities are backed by various kinds of assets of the issuing corporation. Unsecured
                                        debt securities are backed only by the reputation, credit record, and financial stability of the
                                        corporation. Regardless of whether secured or unsecured, the interest on debt securities is
                                        always paid before dividends on stock (preferred and common).


                                        Mortgage Bonds
                                        Just as the owner of a home pledges a real asset (the home and land) as collateral for the
                                        mortgage, a corporation will borrow money backed by real estate of the corporation. For
                                        example, the real estate could be the factories or office buildings the company owns. Just as a
                                        home ordinarily would have a market value greater than the principal amount of its mortgage,
                                        the value of the real estate pledged by the corporation will be in excess of the amount
                                        borrowed under that bond issue. If the corporation develops financial problems and is unable
                                        to pay the interest on the bonds, those real assets pledged as collateral are generally sold to pay
                                        off the mortgage bond­holders. There may be a situation where foreclosing on the property
                                        results in a sale below the outstanding mortgage balance. In that case, the mortgage holder
                                        becomes a general creditor for the unsatisfied balance.


                                        Equipment Trust Certificates
                                        Corporations, particularly railroads and airline companies, finance the acquisition of their
                                        rolling stock, locomotives, or airplanes by issuing an equipment trust certificate. The company
                                        makes a down payment—usually 20% of the cost of the rolling stock—and finances the
                                        balance over the course of time, for example, 15 years. Because the equipment does wear out,
                                        the railroad will pay off a portion of the loan on an annual basis. At no time, theoretically, is
                                        the value of the assets (the rolling stock, locomotives, or planes) worth less than the amount
                                        of the principal remaining on the loan. When the company has finished paying off the loan,
                                        it receives clear title to its equipment from the trustee. If the company does not make the
                                        payments, the lender repossesses the collateral and sells it for her benefit. If you have ever
                                        financed the purchase of a car, it is basically the same concept.


                                        Collateral Trust Bonds
                                        Sometimes a corporation wants to borrow money and has neither real estate (for a mortgage)
                                        nor equipment (for an equipment trust) to use as collateral. Instead, it deposits securities
                                        it owns into a trust to serve as collateral for the lenders. The securities it deposits can be
                                        securities in that corporation or any other securities as long as the securities are marketable,
                                        that is, readily liquidated. Obviously, the better the quality of the securities deposited as
                                        collateral, the better the quality and rating of the bond. You might see these called collateral
                                        trust certificates.

                      Debentures
                      A debenture is a debt obligation of the corporation backed only by its word and general
                      creditworthiness. Debentures are written promises of the corporation to pay the principal at
                      its due date and interest on a regular basis. Although this promise is as binding as a promise
                      for a mortgage bond, debentures are not secured by any pledge of property. They are sold on
                      the general credit of the company. The quality depends on the overall assets and earnings of
                      the corporation. Although debentures are unsecured, there are issuers whose credit standing is
                      so good that their debentures are safer than mortgage bonds of less creditworthy companies.
                      This is similar in concept to the extension of credit on your credit cards. The better your credit
                      score, the higher the limit and the lower the interest rate.


                      Guaranteed Bonds
                      A guaranteed bond is a bond that is guaranteed as to payment of interest, or both principal
                      and interest, by a corporate entity other than the issuer. The value of the guarantee is only
                      as good as the strength of the company making that guarantee. Guaranteed bonds were
                      particularly popular in the railroad industry in which a major railroad seeking to lease
                      trackage rights from a short line would guarantee that smaller company’s debt. A more recent
                      example is the ExxonMobil Corporation guaranteeing the debt issues of the Exxon Pipeline
                      Company. Because no collateral is pledged, these are considered an unsecured debt?


                      Senior
                      The word senior describes the relative priority of claim of a security. Every preferred stock
                      has a senior claim to common stock. Every debt security has senior claim to preferred stock.
                      Secured bonds have a senior claim to unsecured debt, such as debentures. The term senior
                      security means bonds and preferred stock, because they have a claim senior to common stock.
                      If an exam question described a corporation as having issued senior bonds, the answer would
                      have to state that there were mortgage bonds and/or collateral trust bonds and/or equipment
                      trust certificates issued by that corporation with prior claim ahead of unsecured creditors.


                      Subordinated
                      The term subordinated means “belonging to a lower or inferior class or rank; secondary1.” It is
                      usually describing a debenture. A subordinated debenture has a claim that is behind (junior
                      to) that of any other creditor. However, no matter how subordinated the debenture, it is still
                      senior to any stockholder.


                      Income Bonds
                      Income bonds, also known as adjustment bonds, are used when a company is reorganizing
                      and coming out of bankruptcy. Income bonds pay interest only if the corporation has enough
                      income to meet the interest payment and if the board of directors declares a payment. Because
                      missed interest payments do not accumulate for future payment, these bonds are not suitable
                      investments for customers seeking stable income.
                                                                                                                            Unit 5

                                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  1.   A debenture is issued with the backing of
                                                        A. the general credit of the corporation.
                                                        B. a pledge of real estate.
                                                        C. a pledge of equipment.
                                                        D. the ability to levy taxes.
                                                       Answer: A. There are no pledged assets behind a debenture—merely the credit
                                                       standing of the corporation. A pledge of real estate would back a mortgage bond. A
                                                       pledge of equipment would back an equipment trust certificate. Only corporations
                                                       issue debentures and corporations cannot levy taxes.


                                        Zero Coupon Bond
                                        All bonds we have discussed up to this point pay semiannual interest. Zero coupon bonds
                                        (zeroes) are debt obligations that do not make any interest payments. Instead, zeroes are
                                        issued, or trade, at a deep discount and mature at par ($1,000). The difference between the
                                        discounted purchase price and the full face value at maturity is the return the investor receives.
                                        That return is called accretion. We will learn about the tax treatment of accretion later in this
                                        unit.

                                        The current market price of a zero coupon bond reflects the current interest rates for
                                        similar maturities. In addition to corporations, state and local governments, as well as the
                                        U.S. Treasury, can issue zero coupon bonds.

                                        The major attraction of this type of investment is that it allows an investor to lock in a
                                        yield (or rate of return) for a predetermined, investor-selected time with no reinvestment
                                        risk (covered in Lesson 14.1). That is why these are often used to fund future education or
                                        retirement needs. Because all zeroes are sold at discounts and have no current return, there is
                                        a great deal of price volatility. As we learned in Unit 4, the duration of a zero coupon bond is
                                        always equal to the length to maturity. For regular bonds paying interest every six months, the
                                        duration (the payback) is shorter. Shorter duration equals less volatility.


           LESSON 5.2: PRIORITY IN DISSOLUTIONS
                                        LO 5.b Recall the sequence of priority of claims in the event of a corporate
                                        liquidation.



                                        Liquidation Priority
                                        When a corporation is unable to meet its obligations, it is sometimes forced to liquidate. This
                                        is generally done through a formal bankruptcy filing. The exact procedure and the different
                                        types of filings are not tested. The exam may ask you who is last, who is first, and who is in
                                        between.

                                        At this point in your study, you are probably able to answer that question. Just to be sure, here
                                        it is.

                          Common stockholders
                         Regardless of how low on the totem pole a debt security is, such as a subordinated debenture,
                         it still has priority in terms of payment of interest and principal ahead of any equity security.
                         Look for a question asking, in essence, “In the event of a corporate liquidation, who comes
                         first: A senior, prior lien preferred stock, or a junior, unsecured subordinated debenture?”
                         Now, you may not see all of those adjectives, but no matter what, a debt security always has
                         priority over an equity security.

                         In addition, the exam may want you to know about the priority of items that are not
                         securities. Highest priority, after the secured creditors, such as mortgage bonds, is given to
                         wages (up to an indexed amount earned in the 180 days before the employer’s declaration
                         of bankruptcy), followed by taxes, and then the unsecured (general) creditors, such as the
                         debentures.

                                    TAKE NOTE
                                    It is possible that the exam will ask about claims from those not owning securities. The
                                    term is administrative claims (or something to that effect). In a bankruptcy, there are
                                    many administrative roles. They include attorneys, property appraisers, the courts, et
                                    cetera. They must be paid for doing the work and therefore have first priority. There
                                    could even be a case where the presiding judge honors claims of employees and those
                                    owed taxes before the secured creditors. We don’t expect this on your exam, only the
                                    earlier list. Nevertheless, just in case something should show up, we want you to be
                                    prepared.

                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                    2.   If a corporation, whose stock is publicly traded, declares bankruptcy, holders of
                                         which of the following would be most likely to recover the greatest amount of their
                                         investment?
                                           A. Control stock
                                           B. Senior preferred stock
                                           C. Debentures
                                           D. Collateral trust certificates
                                         Answer: D. Creditors of the corporation have the first claim. Secured creditors—
                                         those with assets pledged as collateral—are at the “top of the heap.” They are
                                         followed by general creditors, such as debenture holders. Regardless of the adjective
                                         employed, preferred stock is equity and all debt is ahead of equity. Control stock has
                                         no meaning here. It is common stock and, like all common stock, has the final claim.


              LESSON 5.3: CONVERTIBLE DEBT

                         LO 5.c Identify the unique characteristics of convertible debt securities.

                                                                                                                                       Unit 5
                         Convertible Debt Securities
                         A special type of long-term corporate debt security not covered in the previous lesson is one
                         that is convertible. What is the convertible feature? When these are issued, the company states
                         that lenders (the investors) may exchange (convert) the debt into shares of the company’s




Series_7_2E.indb 121                                                                                                       11/19/2021 7:52:40 PM

                                        common stock. These convertible securities are only issued by corporations. Because they
                                        may be converted or exchanged for the company’s common stock, there are no convertible
                                        municipal or government bonds. The conversion privilege is exercised at the discretion of the
                                        investor. The ratio of conversion varies from one company’s bond to another, according to the
                                        terms set forth in the indenture at the time the bonds are issued. The exact number of shares
                                        (or method of computing the number) that a particular bond will be convertible into at any
                                        point is printed in the bond indenture at the time of issue. Most convertibles are debentures.


                                        Conversion Ratio
                                        The conversion price is the stock price at which a convertible bond can be exchanged for
                                        shares of common stock. The conversion ratio, also called the conversion rate, expresses the
                                        number of shares of stock a bond may be converted into.

                                        In many cases, the indenture merely tells you the number of shares into which the bond is
                                        convertible. For example, the bond may be convertible into 50 shares; thus, it would have
                                        a conversion ratio of 50:1, 50 shares for 1 bond. If a bond is convertible into 25 shares, it
                                        would have a conversion ratio of 25:1.

                                        Frequently, instead of telling the number of shares into which the bond is convertible, the
                                        indenture will give the conversion price. That conversion price is the price per share that
                                        the corporation will sell their stock in exchange for the bond one is holding. Regardless of
                                        the current market price of the bond, the bond always represents a debt of the corporation
                                        of $1,000. Therefore, if the conversion price is given, to compute the number of shares into
                                        which the bond is convertible, always divide the par value ($1,000) by the conversion price.
                                        For example, a bond convertible at $20 per share is convertible into 50 shares ($1,000 ÷ $20
                                        = 50 shares).

                                        If the bond has a conversion price of $50, the conversion ratio is 20 shares ($1,000 ÷ $50 =
                                        20 shares).

                                                  EXAMPLE
                                                  If the JRP 6s of ‘31, currently selling at 120, were convertible at $40, how many shares
                                                  would one get when one converted the bond? The answer is not 30. The current
                                                  market has nothing to do with the computation. The bond conversion is fixed at
                                                  issuance, and the market fluctuates all the time. The correct answer is 25 shares
                                                  ($1,000 ÷ $40 = 25 shares).

                                                  TAKE NOTE
                                                  The same concept applies to convertible preferred stock. An investor bought a share
                                                  of preferred $100 par. You can derive that the investor is entitled to five shares of
                                                  common—$100 ÷ the conversion price of $20 = conversion ratio of five shares.


                                        Advantages of Convertible Securities to the Issuer
                                        A corporation adds a conversion feature to its bonds or preferred stock to make it more
                                        marketable. This is similar to the “sweetener” concept we mentioned in Unit 3. Other facts
                                        about convertible securities include the following:
                                         Convertibles can be sold with a lower coupon rate than nonconvertibles because of the
                                          conversion feature.
                                         A company can eliminate a fixed interest charge as conversion takes place, thus reducing
                                          debt.



Series_7_2E.indb 122                                                                                                                         11/19/2021 7:52:40 PM
                                                                                         Unit 5   Corporate Bonds     123


                        Because conversion normally occurs over time, it does not have an adverse effect on the
                         stock price, which may occur after a subsequent primary offering.
                        At issuance, conversion price is higher than market price of the common stock.


                       Disadvantages of Convertible Securities to the Issuer
                       On the other hand, convertibles have potential disadvantages for a corporation and its
                       stockholders. Most of these will be clearer as we move further into the course.
                        When bonds are converted, shareholders’ equity is diluted; that is, more shares are
                         outstanding, so each share now represents a smaller fraction of ownership in the company.
                        Common stockholders have a voice in the company’s management, so a substantial
                         conversion could cause a shift in the control of the company.
                        Reducing corporate debt through conversion means a loss of leverage.
                        The resulting decrease in deductible interest costs raises the corporation’s taxable income.


                       Advantages of Convertible Securities to Investors
                       Convertible bonds offer the safety of the fixed-income market and the potential appreciation
                       of the equity market, providing investors with the following advantages:
                        As a debt security, a convertible debenture pays interest at a fixed rate and is redeemable
                         for its face value at maturity, provided the debenture is not converted. As a rule, interest
                         income is higher and surer than dividend income on the underlying common stock.
                         Similarly, convertible preferred stock usually pays a higher dividend than does common
                         stock.
                        If a corporation experiences financial difficulties, convertible bondholders have priority
                         over common stockholders in the event of a corporate liquidation.
                        In theory, a convertible debenture’s market price tends to be more stable during market
                         declines than the underlying common stock’s price. If the stock price declines to a level
                         well below the conversion price, the debenture’s price will then reflect a CY competitive
                         with other debt securities.
                        Because convertibles can be exchanged for common stock, their market price tends to
                         move upward if the stock price moves up. The owner of a convertible debenture has all
                         the upside potential of the common stockholder with less downside risk. That means
                         possible inflation protection. This is a feature most fixed-income securities do not offer.
                        Conversion of a senior security into common stock is not considered a purchase and a sale
                         for tax purposes. Thus, the investor incurs no tax liability on the conversion transaction.

                        The primary disadvantage to an investor is the lower interest rate paid on convertibles.
                         For test purposes, it is important to know that these are not suitable for investors with
                         the objective of income. Specifically, if a question lists a number of different investment
                         vehicles and it states that the investor is looking for income, do not select the convertible          Unit 5
                         bond option. There will be a better choice.

                                         Because most convertibles are debentures, the investor’s priority is lower than other debt
                                          securities. That can be a concern if the company’s financial outlook is shaky.
                                         If the security is callable, there is the possibility the issuer will call it and force the investor
                                          to decide whether or not to convert. Once converted, the semiannual interest payments
                                          are gone. This means the investor is subject to all of the risks of owning common stock.
                                          The investor no longer receives the obligatory semiannual interest payments. As a
                                          common stockholder, the priority in liquidation is at the bottom.


                                        Anti-Dilutive Protection
                                        Think of the everyday definition of dilution. If you took a chemistry class in school, you
                                        couldn’t use acid at its full strength. You added a solution to it and the acid was diluted
                                        (weakened). Put ice in your beverage and, as it melts, the drink is diluted. Dilution is a topic
                                        of interest in this industry.

                                        One of the concerns of any holder of a convertible security (bond or preferred stock) is
                                        protection against the potential dilution resulting from a stock split or a stock dividend.
                                        For example, if you owned a bond convertible into 20 shares and the issuer declared a 2:1
                                        stock split, in order for you to have the same conversion benefit, you would need to be able
                                        to convert into 40 shares. On the other hand, if the conversion privilege were expressed as a
                                        conversion price, the new price would now be half the former one, allowing you to convert
                                        into twice as many “new” shares.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   3.   An investor seeking to maximize current income would find which of the following
                                                        investments least suitable?
                                                          A. Callable bond
                                                          B. Convertible debenture
                                                          C. Equipment trust certificate
                                                          D. Mortgage bond
                                                        Answer: B. One of the negative points about investing in convertible securities is
                                                        their reduced income. Whether the dividend on a convertible preferred stock or the
                                                        interest on a convertible debenture, the dividend or interest will be lower than other
                                                        securities of that issuer. Investors accept the lower income in exchange for the ability
                                                        to profit from the conversion feature. The key point is, do not recommend convertible
                                                        securities to those investors seeking to maximize current income.


                                        LO 5.d Compute the parity price of a convertible bond.



                                        Computing Parity
                                        All of the comments we’ve made about convertible bonds (or convertible preferred) moving
                                        in relation to the underlying common stock is because of the concept of parity. According
                                        to the dictionary, when two things are at parity, they are equal. How does that work here?
                                        If you think about it, when holding a convertible security, investors have a choice of two
                                        actions: they can either continue to hold the bond (or preferred), or, they can decide to
                                        convert it into the common. If the convertible security and the common stock we would get
                                        upon conversion are worth the same, we say they are at parity. Before we can get into the
                                        computations, we need a short lesson in corporate bond quotes.

                       Corporate Bond Quotes
                       In Lesson 4.2, we introduced you to the concept of quoting bonds as a percentage of their
                       $1,000 par value. Let’s take it one step further by showing you how those quotes can be in
                       fractions. With a face value of $1,000, each percentage point of that face is equal to $10.
                       That would mean a bond quoted at 99 is $990 and one quoted at 101 is $1,010. These $10
                       “points” are further divided into eights. Each 1/8 has a value of $1.25 (divide $10.00 by 8 and
                       it equals $1.25).

                                  EXAMPLE
                                  The following may help you on some questions:
                                      1/8 = $1.25
                                      ¼ = $2.50
                                      3/8 = $3.75
                                      ½ = $5.00
                                      5/8 = $6.25
                                      ¾ = $7.50
                                      7/8 = $8.75

                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                  4.   ABC Corporation’s 4% bond is currently trading at 985/8. That would be price of
                                        A. $98.625.
                                        B. $980.625.
                                        C. $985.80.
                                        D. $986.25.
                                       Answer: D. We do this in two steps. First, the 98 is 98% of $1,000, or $980. Second,
                                       we add the 5/8, which is $6.25. That totals $986.25. Remember, the fraction is of
                                       $10.00, not $1.00.

                       A question looking for the parity price will always include mention of the conversion rate of
                       the convertible security (debenture or preferred stock). If it is looking for the parity price of
                       the stock, it will include the current market price of the convertible. If the question is about the
                       parity price of the convertible, then it will show the current market price of the stock.

                                  EXAMPLE
                                  On the exam, there may be questions on computing the parity price. Here are two
                                  methods to help you solve the problem.
                                  RST debenture is convertible to common at $50. If RST bond is currently trading for
                                  $1,200, what is the parity price of the common?
                                  Method One: Parity means equal. Solve for the conversion ratio as follows:
                                       Par value: $1,000

                                                                                                                                     Unit 5
                                       Conversion price: $50
                                       Conversion ratio: 20
                                  The parity stock price is found by dividing $1,200 by 20. The parity price of the
                                  common is $60.

           126         Unit 5   Corporate Bonds



                                                  Think of the phrase, “Six of one, half-dozen of the other.” That means whichever you
                                                  have, they are both worth the same. In this case, we are told the bond is trading at
                                                  $1,200. We know you can swap it for 20 shares. If those shares are selling for $60 each,
                                                  converting gets you the same $1,200 in value as just holding the bond. That is parity—
                                                  equal.
                                                  Method Two: If you prefer to think in percentages, identify that the current
                                                  debenture’s price of $1,200 is 20% greater than the original $1,000 price. To be at
                                                  equivalence, the stock price must also increase by 20%. So add 20% to 50 and the
                                                  problem is solved. 20% of 50 is 10; 10 + 50 = parity price of $60.
                                                  Here is another question about parity price.
                                                  RST debenture is convertible to common at $50. If the common is trading for $45, what
                                                  is the parity price of the debenture? Start by solving for the conversion ratio.
                                                       Par value: $1,000
                                                       Conversion price: $50
                                                       Conversion ratio: 20
                                                  The debenture’s parity price is found by multiplying 20 × $45, which is $900. Using the
                                                  percentage method, you can determine that the market price of the common stock is
                                                  10% below that of the conversion price (5 ÷ 50 = 10%). Reducing the debenture price
                                                  of $1,000 by 10% results in a parity price of the debenture of $900.
                                        It is important to remember that parity is a theoretical concept—we’re looking for the price
                                        that would make the bond and stock “equal.” In actuality, convertible securities, whether
                                        debentures or preferred stock, almost always have a market price that is somewhat above the
                                        parity price.

                                        When the equity market is strong and stock prices are rising, the convertible’s value rises with
                                        the underlying common stock’s value. When equity prices are declining, the convertible’s
                                        market price declines as well, but generally levels off when its yield becomes competitive
                                        with the yield on nonconvertible bonds. This tends to keep it from declining as much as the
                                        common stock. Convertible bonds normally sell at a premium above parity.

                                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  5.   ABC Corporation has issued $100 million of convertible debentures having a
                                                       nondilutive covenant. Each debenture is convertible into 40 shares of ABC’s common
                                                       stock. If ABC declares a 2:1 stock split,
                                                         A. each debenture will be convertible into 20 shares.
                                                         B. the conversion price of each debenture will be $25 per share.
                                                         C. the conversion price of each debenture will be $12.50 per share.
                                                        D. the total value of the debentures will increase to $200 million.
                                                       Answer: C. When a debenture is convertible into 40 shares, the conversion price is
                                                       $25 per share ($1,000 divided by 40 shares). After a 2:1 stock split, the conversion rate
                                                       will now be twice as many shares (80). The split will make the conversion price half
                                                       of what it initially was. Instead of $25 per share, it will be $12.50 ($1,000 divided by
                                                       80 shares). The key takeaway is that anytime there is an action creating more shares
                                                       (without raising more money), such as a stock split or a stock (not cash) dividend, the
                                                       price per share goes down.

              LESSON 5.4: TAXATION OF CORPORATE DEBT
                         LO 5.e Differentiate between the different kinds of tax treatment of taxable debt
                         securities.

                         Just as with equity securities, corporate debt securities are subject to taxation. In this lesson we
                         will describe the kinds of tax issues facing investors in corporate debt.


                         Interest
                         In all cases on the exam, the interest paid by corporations on their debt securities is treated as
                         ordinary income. Unlike dividends on stock, there is no category of “qualified” interest with a
                         reduced tax rate. In addition to federal income tax, this interest is taxable on a state and local
                         level as well. If the bondholder lives in a state with an income tax, that just increases the tax
                         burden. Some cities have an income tax and that adds to the total amount of taxes paid.

                         In the previous lesson, we discussed the zero coupon bond. Although zeroes pay no regular
                         interest income, investors in zeroes owe income tax each year on the amount by which the
                         bonds have accreted, just as if the investor had received it in cash. The income tax is due
                         regardless of the direction of the market price. Let’s look at an example to see how that works.

                                    EXAMPLE
                                    An investor buys a 10-year zero coupon corporate bond for $400. At maturity, the
                                    investor will receive the full face value of $1,000. As a result, the investor realizes $600
                                    of interest income. Each year, however, the investor must accrete the discount and pay
                                    income tax on the annual income. This investor didn’t “see” the income annually, but
                                    still has to pay taxes on it. We call that phantom income.
                                    Here is how it works: The IRS requires the investor to accrete the discount annually on
                                    a straight-line basis. The total discount is $600. Because the bond matures in 10 years,
                                    the investor must accrete $60 annually ($600 ÷ 10 years). Each year, the investor pays
                                    income tax on $60 of interest income. The good news is that each year, the investor
                                    is permitted to adjust the cost basis of the zero upward by the amount of the annual
                                    accretion. After one year, the investor’s cost basis is $460.
                                    After two years, the cost basis is $520. After three years, it is $580, and so on. At
                                    maturity, the cost basis will be adjusted to par. Therefore, if held to maturity, there is
                                    no capital gain (cost basis is par; redeemed at par).
                                    However, if the investor sells the zero before maturity, there may be a capital gain or a
                                    capital loss, depending on the difference between sales proceeds and the cost basis
                                    (accreted value) at time of sale.
                                    If the same 10-year zero bought at $400 is sold five years later for $720, the investor will
                                    realize a $20 per-bond gain. At that point, the investor’s cost basis is $700 ($400 plus
                                    five years of annual accretion of $60 per year).

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   6.   An investor purchases a corporate zero coupon bond at a price of $510. The bond
                                                        matures in seven years. Four years later, the bond is sold at a price of $690. What are
                                                        the tax consequences of the sale?
                                                          A. Gain of $180
                                                         B. Loss of $100
                                                         C. Loss of $310
                                                         D. No gain or loss until maturity
                                                        Answer: B. The amount of the discount is $490 ($1,000 – $510). This must be accreted
                                                        over the seven years until maturity. The annual accretion is $70 ($490 ÷ 7 years). After
                                                        four years, there is $280 of accretion (4 × $70). Because the annual accretion is added
                                                        to the investor’s cost basis, the basis is now $790 ($510 + $280). The bond’s sale price
                                                        of $690 is $100 below the accreted basis. That means a loss of $100.


                                        Capital Gains and Capital Losses
                                        The practice question we just did is a great segue into the next topic. Just as with other assets,
                                        when a bond is sold for a price higher than its cost, there is a capital gain. When sold below
                                        cost, there is a capital loss.

                                        As we’ve stated, holding a zero coupon bond to maturity results in no gain or loss. That is not the
                                        case with interest-bearing bonds. There is no accretion with them. Just compare purchase and sale
                                        prices to determine a gain or a loss. When a bond is held to maturity, the sale price is par.

                                        The tax rules are the same as we learned in Lesson 3.4. If the holding period is 12 months or
                                        less, any gain or loss is short-term. If the holding period is longer than 12 months, it is long-
                                        term. When computing net gains and losses, it makes no difference whether the transaction
                                        is in a bond or a stock. A gain is a gain and a loss is a loss. The IRS is only concerned about
                                        long-term and short-term.

              INTRODUCTION
                         Municipal debt financing is represented by securities issued either by a state or local
                         government or by U.S. territories. They can also be issued by municipal authorities and
                         special districts. Investors who buy these securities are loaning money to the issuers for the
                         purpose of public works and construction projects (e.g., roads, hospitals, civic centers, sewer
                         systems, and airports). Municipal securities are considered second in safety of principal only
                         to U.S. government and U.S. government agency securities. The safety of a particular issue is
                         based on the issuing municipality’s financial stability. Most of the exam questions will deal with
                         municipal bonds. As with the bonds we have previously discussed, these represent long-term
                         debt. There may also be some questions about short-term financing. That is done by issuing
                         notes, and we will cover them after the bonds. One highly tested area is that of the special tax
                         treatment afforded the interest on these securities. After covering that, we will conclude the unit
                         with a discussion of some of the rules issues by the MSRB.

           LESSON 6.1: GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF MUNICIPAL BONDS
                                        LO 6.a Identify the general characteristics of municipal bonds.



                                        Municipal Bond Price or Basis Quotations
                                        In a few cases, municipal bonds are quoted the same as corporate bonds (Lesson 5.3). That is,
                                        a percentage of par and in fractions of eighths. Municipal bonds are usually priced and offered
                                        for sale on a yield to maturity (YTM) basis rather than a dollar price. This is called a basis
                                        quote. In this case, the bond’s basis is its YTM. If the bond is quoted at a 3.78 basis, it means
                                        the yield to maturity is 3.78%.

                                        Each basis point is 1/100 of 1 percent. That is, if the yield on the previous bond quoted at
                                        a 3.78 basis should fall to a yield of 3.65%, we would say the yield has dropped by 13 basis
                                        points. We can also use basis points to reflect price changes. If one point on a bond is equal to
                                        $10 (1% of $1,000), then 1 basis point is 1/100 of that or 10 cents ($0.10).

                                        In other cases, the bond quote is just a regular percentage. That would mean a bond quoted
                                        at 102.4% is trading at $1,024. When a bond is quoted as a price instead of basis (yield), it is
                                        known as a dollar bond.

                                                  EXAMPLE
                                                  A basis quote may be listed as 7s 35 at 7.5. This is a 7% coupon for a bond maturing in
                                                  2035 with a YTM of 7.5%. If the YTM is greater than the coupon, we can determine that
                                                  the bond is trading at a discount.
                                                  A price quote may be listed as 7s 35 at 99.5. This is a 7% coupon for a bond maturing in
                                                  2035 with a price of 99.5% of par, or $995. If the bond is trading at a discount, we can
                                                  determine that the YTM is greater than the coupon. This is an example of a dollar bond.
                                                  For those who trade bonds, it is easy to turn a basis quote into a price quote or turn a
                                                  price quote into a basis quote (there is software for that). You won’t have to do it, but
                                                  should know the relationship between price and yield.
                                                  A zero coupon bond would be listed with Zr, indicating the bond pays no interest: Zr
                                                  35 at 70.

                                                  TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                  If a question mentions a 6% bond quoted on a 6.5 basis, you should be able to
                                                  determine that the coupon of the bond is 6% and its YTM is 6.5%. Because the YTM is
                                                  higher than the coupon, the bond is trading at a discount.

                       Municipal Bond Quote Rules
                       Municipal bonds are bought and sold in the OTC market. They are not listed on the stock
                       exchanges. Most large brokerages maintain trading departments that deal exclusively in
                       municipal bonds. Under the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975, the MSRB was created to
                                                                                                                                    Unit 6
                       regulate securities professionals in the municipal securities field. In this unit, we will regularly
                       refer to MSRB rules. It is not necessary to learn the numbers. We will start with Rule G-13
                       dealing with quotes.


                       Bona Fide (Firm) Quotes
                       If a municipal dealer gives, distributes, or publishes a quotation for a security, that quote must
                       be bona fide. For a quote to be considered bona fide, or firm, the dealer must be prepared to
                       trade the security at the price specified in the quote and under the conditions and restrictions
                       (if any) accompanying the quote. A bona fide quote
                        must reflect the dealer’s best judgment and have a reasonable relationship to the fair
                         market value (FMV) for that security and
                        may reflect the firm’s inventory and expectations of market direction.
                       In other words, a quotation need not represent the best price, but it must have a reasonable
                       relationship to FMV. A quotation may take into consideration other factors, such as the
                       dealer’s inventory position and any anticipated market movement.

                       If the dealer distributes or publishes the quotation on behalf of another dealer, it must have
                       reason to believe that the quote is bona fide and based on the other dealer’s best judgment of
                       FMV. Dealers cannot knowingly misrepresent a quote made by another municipal securities
                       dealer.

                       Quotations are always subject to prior sale or change in price. Any means of communication,
                       including print, voice, and electronic media, can be used to disseminate, distribute, or publish
                       quotations.

                                  TAKE NOTE
                                  Municipal dealers can make offers to sell securities by providing quotes without
                                  owning the bonds. The dealer, however, must know where to obtain the bonds if such
                                  offers are accepted.


                       Other Types of Quotations
                       In addition to a firm quote, a municipal securities dealer can give several other types of
                       quotations. The most common are workable indications and nominal quotes. A dealer can
                       also hold a quote for a specified time.
                        A workable indication reflects a bid price at which a dealer will purchase securities from
                         another dealer. A dealer giving a workable indication is always free to revise its bid for the
                         securities as market conditions change.
                        A nominal, or subject, quotation indicates a dealer’s estimate of a security’s market
                         value. Nominal quotations are provided for informational purposes only and are
                         permitted if the quotes are clearly labeled as such. The rules on nominal quotes apply to
                         all municipal bond quotes distributed or published by any dealer.
                        Holding a quote. A municipal securities dealer may quote a bond price that is firm for
                         a certain time. This is called an out-firm with recall quote. Generally, these quotes are

                                             firm for an hour (or half hour) with a five-minute recall period. This provides time for the
                                             dealer who requested the quote to search for a better quote before selling the bonds. If,
                                             during this period, the firm that made the quote has another buyer interested in the same
                                             bonds, that firm can contact the dealer and give him five minutes to act on the quote.
                                             If no action is taken and a transaction does not take place within the five-minute recall
                                             period, he loses the right to buy the bonds at the quoted price.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   Receiving an out-firm quote allows dealers to try to sell bonds that they don’t own,
                                                   knowing that if they find a buyer within the allotted time, they can buy the bonds at a
                                                   fixed price from the firm providing the out-firm quote.

                                         BW/OW. Municipal dealers are called upon regularly to provide current quotations for
                                          municipal securities they do not have in inventory. Municipal bonds are not listed on any
                                          exchange—they do not have the quote and price transparency of listed securities. When
                                          a customer of a municipal firm is looking for a specific bond, the dealer will actively
                                          solicit offers to sell from the marketplace. If the customer has bonds to sell, the dealer will
                                          actively solicit bids from the marketplace for those bonds.

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   Under MSRB rules, any indication of interest or solicitation by a municipal dealer (such
                                                   as bid wanted or offer wanted) would be considered a quotation request. The term
                                                   quotation means any bid for or offer of municipal securities.

                                         Multiple markets in the same security. There are some very large financial organizations
                                          that have more than one broker-dealer under their control. Let’s call them Affiliate X
                                          and Affiliate Y. If they publish a quote for a municipal security, it must be clear that this
                                          represents only one quote instead of two independent quotes. To do otherwise would
                                          imply a greater liquidity in the bonds.


                                        Municipal Bond Maturities
                                        There are three types of maturity schedules commonly found with municipal debt issues. Any
                                        of the following may be on your exam.


                                        Term Maturity
                                        All principal matures at a single date in the future. Term bonds are quoted by price (like
                                        corporate bonds) and, as mentioned previously, are called dollar bonds.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   Consider the following municipal bond issue:
                                                   $200 million Illinois GO 5% debentures due November 1, 2041.
                                                   The entire $200 million matures in 2041.
                                        To facilitate the retirement of its bonds, a corporate or municipal issuer may establish a
                                        sinking fund operated by the bonds’ trustee. The trust indenture often requires a sinking
                                        fund, which can be used to call bonds, redeem bonds at maturity, or buy back bonds in the
                                        open market. The concept is similar to the escrow account on a home mortgage. Monthly

                                  payments are made by the homeowner to ensure that funds will be available to pay the annual
                                  insurance premium and property taxes.

                                  To establish a sinking fund, the issuer deposits cash in an account with the trustee. Because
                                  a sinking fund makes money available for paying off the bonds, it can aid the bonds’
                                  marketability and safety.                                                                                   Unit 6

                                  Serial Maturity
                                  Bonds within an issue mature on different dates according to a predetermined schedule. The
                                  following sample serial maturity structure table shows an example of a $100 million State of
                                  Illinois GO serial issue.

               $20 million      6%         11-1-45        6.40%

                                  Serial bonds are quoted on the basis of their yield to maturity (basis), to reflect the difference
                                  of maturity dates within one issue. A price/yield of 100% indicates the yield to maturity is
                                  equal to the coupon rate, which means the bond is being offered at par. Notice that the longer
                                  the maturity, the higher the yield.


                                  Balloon Maturity
                                  An issuer pays part of a bond’s maturity before the final maturity date, but the largest portion
                                  is paid off at maturity. The sample balloon maturity table below shows an example of a $100
                                  million State of Georgia GO balloon maturity issue due August 1, 2045.

               $70 million       6%        8-1-45        100%


                                            TAKE NOTE
                                            A balloon maturity is a type of serial maturity. Also note that most municipal bonds are
                                            issued serially.

                                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  1.   All of the following statements are generally true about dollar bonds except
                                                        A. they are term bonds.
                                                        B. they are serial bonds.
                                                        C. they have a sinking fund provision.
                                                        D. they are quoted as a percentage of par.
                                                       Answer: B. Dollar bonds are quoted as a percentage of par. That means in dollars
                                                       and cents (hence the reason for their name). These are invariably term bonds
                                                       because serial bonds are quoted on yield basis. With the principal payout due in a
                                                       lump sum at the end of the term, a sinking fund is usually added to provide for the
                                                       ultimate payoff.

                                        in tax-exempt bond offerings. The issuer of the debt is responsible for retaining the bond
                                        counsel. The legal opinion states that the issue is legally binding on the issuer and conforms to
                                        applicable laws. If interest from the bond is tax-exempt, that too is stated in the legal opinion.

                                        The legal opinion is issued either as a qualified opinion (there may be a legal uncertainty
                                        of which purchasers should be informed) or as an unqualified opinion (issued by the bond
                                        counsel unconditionally).

                                        Some issuers, normally smaller municipalities, choose not to obtain a legal opinion. In
                                        such a case, the bond certificate must clearly state that the bonds are ex-legal. The ex-legal
                                        designation allows a bond to meet good delivery requirements without an attached legal
                                        opinion.


                                        The Underwriter’s Counsel
                                        The managing underwriter may choose to employ another law firm as underwriter’s
                                        counsel. This firm is not responsible for the legal opinion and is employed to represent the
                                        underwriter’s interests.

                                                  TAKE NOTE
                                                  Issuers desire an unqualified legal opinion.

                                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  2.   The bond counsel’s services in providing the legal opinion associated with a new

                                                         D. the MSRB.
                                                       Answer: A. The issuer retains the bond attorneys, or the bond counsel, for a new
                                                       municipal bond issue. The underwriters may also hire bond counsel, but they do not
                                                       provide the legal opinion.

              LESSON 6.2: DIFFERENT TYPES OF MUNICIPAL SECURITIES
                          LO 6.b Describe the purposes of the different types of municipal securities.

                          Municipal securities are defined by their maturities. Those with a maturity of less than three              Unit 6
                          years are considered municipal notes. Those with longer maturities are municipal bonds. We
                          will start with the bonds first. Two categories of municipal bonds exist:
                           General obligation bonds (GOs) are backed by the full faith, credit, and taxing powers of
                            the municipality. GOs issued by local (not state) government units are most often backed
                            by ad valorem taxes.
                           Revenue bonds are backed by the revenues generated by the municipal facility the bond
                            issue finances. Sometimes that revenue comes from special taxes, such as excise taxes or
                            other specified non-ad valorem taxes.


                          GOs Issues
                          GOs are municipal bonds issued for capital improvements that benefit the entire community.
                          Typically, these projects do not produce revenues, so principal and interest must be paid by
                          taxes collected by the municipal issuer. Because of this backing, GOs are known as full faith
                          and credit issues.


                          Sources of Funds
                          GOs are backed by the issuing municipality’s taxing power. Bonds issued by states are backed
                          by income taxes, license fees, and sales taxes. Bonds issued by towns, cities, and counties are
                          backed by property (ad valorem) taxes, license fees, fines, and all other sources of revenue
                          to the municipality. Ad valorem is Latin for according to value. If you own a home, you are
                          familiar with the property tax assessment. In many states, the annual motor vehicle tag is
                          based on an assessed value. School, road, and park districts may also issue municipal bonds
                          backed by property taxes. Because the property of the residents is being taxed, GO’s frequently
                          require voter approval. We will have more to say about ad valorem taxes in the next lesson.

                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                    3.   All of the following are used to pay debt service on GOs except
                                          A. sales taxes.
                                          B. license fees.
                                          C. tolls.
                                          D. ad valorem taxes.
                                         Answer: C. For the exam, GOs are backed by taxes. There will be some exceptions in
                                         the real world, but GOs are predominately backed by tax collections. As we will soon
                                         see, tolls are a debt service source for revenue bonds.


                          Statutory Debt Limits
                          The amount of debt that a municipal government may incur can be limited by state or local
                          statutes to protect taxpayers from excessive taxes. Debt limits can also make a bond safer for
                          investors. The lower the debt limit, the less risk of excessive borrowing and default by the
                          municipality.

           136         Unit 6   Municipal Bonds



                                        If a municipality wishes to issue GOs that would put it above its statutory limit, a public
                                        referendum is required. Voter approval on the referendum must follow.
                                         Tax limits. Some states limit property taxes to a certain percentage of the assessed
                                          property value or to a certain percentage increase in any single year. The tax rate is
                                          expressed in mills; one mill equals $1 per $1,000, or $0.001.
                                         Limited tax GOs. A limited tax GO bond is a bond secured by a specific tax
                                          (e.g., income tax). Alternatively, the limit is place on the amount of tax that may be
                                          assesses as just described. In other words, the issuer is limited as to what tax or taxes or
                                          how much can be used to service the debt. As a result, there is more risk with limited tax
                                          GOs than with a comparable GO backed by the full taxing authority of the issuer.
                                         Overlapping debt. Several taxing authorities that draw from the same taxpayers can issue
                                          debt. Bonds issued by different municipal authorities that tap the same taxpayer wallets
                                          are known as coterminous debt.

                                                  TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                  In the context of municipal securities, the term coterminous refers to two or more
                                                  taxing agencies that share the same geographic boundaries and are able to issue debt
                                                  separately. Overlapping debt occurs when two or more issuers are taxing the same
                                                  property to service their respective debt.

                                                  EXAMPLE
                                                  Take the town of Smithville, located in Jones County. If Smithville issues GO debt, it
                                                  will tax property in Smithville to service that debt. If Jones County issues GO debt,
                                                  it will tax property in the county, which includes Smithville, to service its debt. As a
                                                  result, there are two issuers taxing the same property.

                                                  TAKE NOTE
                                                  Coterminous debt only occurs in property taxing situations. Because states do not
                                                  generally tax real estate, state debt never overlaps.

                                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  4.   Which of the following is not included in the definition of coterminous debt?
                                                        A. County
                                                        B. City
                                                        C. School district
                                                        D. State
                                                       Answer: D. Coterminous, or overlapping, debt occurs when property taxes from
                                                       one property are used in support of debt issued by various municipal issuers. For
                                                       instance, property taxes on a home might support county, city, and school district
                                                       debt obligations. Property taxes are not assessed by states, so states are not
                                                       included in the definition of coterminous or overlapping debt.


                                        Revenue Bonds
                                        Revenue bonds can be used to finance any municipal facility that generates sufficient income.
                                        Revenue bonds are not subject to statutory debt limits and do not require voter approval.
                                        A particular revenue bond issue, however, may be subject to an additional bonds test before
                                        subsequent bond issues with equal liens on the project’s revenue may be issued. The additional
                                        bonds test ensures the adequacy of the revenue stream to pay both the old and new debt.

                                                                                          Unit 6   Municipal Bonds     137


                       Feasibility Study
                       Before issuing a revenue bond, an issuer will engage various consultants to prepare a report
                       detailing the economic feasibility and the need for a particular project (e.g., a new bridge or
                       airport). The study will include estimates of revenues that will be generated and details of the
                                                                                                                                 Unit 6
                       operating, economic, and engineering aspects of the proposed project.


                       Sources of Revenue
                       Revenue bonds’ interest and principal payments are payable to bondholders only from the
                       specific earnings and net lease payments of revenue-producing facilities, such as
                        utilities (water, sewer, and electric);
                        housing;
                        transportation (airports and toll roads);
                        education (college dorms and student loans);
                        health (hospitals and retirement centers);
                        industrial (industrial development and pollution control); and
                        sports.
                       Debt service payments do not come from general or real estate taxes and are not backed by the
                       municipality’s full faith and credit. Revenue bonds are considered self-supporting debt because
                       principal and interest payments are made exclusively from revenues generated by the project
                       for which the debt was issued.


                       Protective Covenants
                       The face of a revenue bond certificate may refer to a trust indenture (or bond resolution).
                       This empowers the trustee to act on behalf of the bondholders.

                       In the trust indenture, the municipality agrees to abide by certain protective covenants, or
                       promises, meant to protect bondholders. A trustee appointed in the indenture supervises the
                       issuer’s compliance with the bond covenants.


                       Trust Indenture
                       The trust indenture’s provisions may vary, but a number of standard provisions are common
                       to most bond issues, including the following:
                        Rate covenant. A promise to maintain rates sufficient to pay expenses and debt service.
                        Maintenance covenant. A promise to maintain the equipment and facility/facilities.
                        Insurance covenant. A promise to insure any facility built so bondholders can be paid off
                         if the facility is destroyed or becomes inoperable.
                        Additional bonds test. Whether the indenture is open-ended (allowing further issuance
                         of bonds with the same status and equal claims on assets or revenues if permitted under

                                        Catastrophe clause. A promise to use insurance proceeds to call bonds and repay
                                         bondholders if a facility is destroyed; a catastrophe call is also called a calamity call or an
                                         extraordinary mandatory call. Bonds with a catastrophe call are not designated callable

                                        Flow of funds. The priority of disbursing the revenues collected.

                                                  TAKE NOTE
                                                  Trust indentures are not required for municipal bonds per the Trust Indenture Act
                                                  of 1939. Municipal issues are exempt from this act. The use of trust indentures is
                                                  optional, but it greatly enhances the marketability of revenue issues. Revenue bonds
                                                  have either a trust resolution or trust indentures, whereas GOs commonly have a bond
                                                  resolution.


                                       Types of Revenue Bonds
                                       There are a number of categories of revenue bonds, depending on the type of facility the bond
                                       issue finances.


                                       Industrial Development Revenue Bonds
                                       A municipal development authority issues industrial development revenue bonds (IDRs or
                                       IDBs) to construct facilities or purchase equipment, which is then leased to a corporation.
                                       The municipality uses the money from lease payments to pay the principal and interest on
                                       the bonds. The ultimate responsibility for the payment of principal and interest rests with the
                                       corporation leasing the facility; therefore, the bonds carry the corporation’s debt rating. Some
                                       of these bonds are subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT). We will cover those in
                                       Lesson 6.6.


                                       Lease-Rental Bonds
                                       Under a typical lease-rental (or lease-back) bond arrangement, a municipality issues bonds to
                                       finance office construction for itself or its state or community.

                                                  EXAMPLE
                                                  An example of a lease-back arrangement follows.
                                                  A municipality might issue bonds to raise money to construct a school and lease the
                                                  finished building to the school district. The lease payments provide backing for the
                                                  bonds.
                                                  Lease payments come from funds raised through special taxes or appropriations, from
                                                  the lessor’s revenues, such as the school’s tuition or fees, or from the municipality’s
                                                  general fund.


                                       Double-Barreled Bonds
                                       Double-barreled bonds are revenue bonds that have characteristics of GOs. Interest and
                                       principal are paid from a specified facility’s earnings. However, the bonds are also backed by
                                       the taxing power of the state or municipality and therefore have the backing of two sources




Series7_06.indd 138                                                                                                                         15/12/22 9:50 AM
                                                                                           Unit 6   Municipal Bonds     139


                       of revenue. Although they are backed primarily by revenues from the facility, double-barreled
                       bonds are rated and traded as GOs.


                       Certificates of Participation
                       Certificates of participation are a form of lease revenue bond that permits the investor to                Unit 6
                       participate in a stream of revenue from lease, installment, or loan payments related to the
                       acquisition of land or the acquisition or construction of specific equipment or facilities by
                       the municipality. Like other revenue issues, they require no voter approval. Certificates of
                       participation are not viewed legally as debt of a municipality because payment is tied to an
                       annual appropriation that is made by the government body. One unique feature with these
                       certificates—though this would be a rare occurrence—is that in theory, the certificate holders
                       themselves can foreclose on the equipment or the facility that the certificates financed in the
                       event of default.


                       Special Tax Bonds
                       Special tax bonds are bonds secured by one or more designated taxes other than ad valorem
                       (property) taxes. For example, bonds for a particular purpose might be supported by sales,
                       tobacco, alcohol, fuel, or business license taxes. However, the designated tax does not have to
                       be directly related to the project purpose. Such bonds are not considered self-supporting debt.
                       That means that other sources may be used if the taxes generated are insufficient. You might
                       see these called designated tax bonds.


                       Special Assessment Bonds (or Special District Bonds)
                       Special assessment bonds are issued to finance the construction of public improvements such
                       as streets, sidewalks, or sewers. The issuer assesses a tax only on the property that benefits from
                       the improvement and uses the funds to pay principal and interest.


                       New Housing Authority Bonds
                       New housing authority bonds are for new housing projects. Please note that new does not
                       mean newly issued bonds. Local housing authorities issue New Housing Authority bonds
                       (NHAs) to develop and improve low-income housing. NHAs are backed by the full faith and
                       credit of the U.S. government. NHAs are sometimes called Public Housing Authority bonds
                       (PHAs). Because of their federal backing, they are considered the most secure of all municipal
                       bonds. PHAs are backed by the rental income from the housing. If the rental income is not
                       sufficient to service the debt, the federal government makes up any shortfall. Note that these
                       bonds are not considered to be double-barreled. To be double-barreled, a bond must be
                       backed by more than one municipal revenue source. In this case, the second backing is the
                       federal government.

                                  TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                  PHAs (or NHAs) are the only municipal issues backed in full by the U.S. government.
                                  They are also called Section 8 bonds.

                                                       Answer: C. Property taxes (ad valorem taxes) are associated with GOs. Special taxes
                                                       can be used to back revenue bonds. Among them are the “sin” taxes. Those are taxes
                                                       on alcohol and tobacco as well as excise taxes on fuel and business license taxes.


                                        Moral Obligation Bonds
                                        A moral obligation bond is a state- or local-issued, or state- or local-agency issued, bond. If
                                        revenues or tax collections backing the bond are not sufficient to pay the debt service, the state
                                        legislature has the authority to appropriate funds to make payments. The potential backing
                                        by state revenues tends to make the bond more marketable, but the state’s obligation is not
                                        established by law; it is a moral obligation only. If a moral obligation bond goes into default,
                                        the only way bondholders can be repaid is through legislative apportionment. The issuer’s
                                        legislature would have to apportion money to satisfy the debt but is not legally obligated to do
                                        so. Remember, the issuer has a moral but not legal obligation to service the debt.

                                                  TAKE NOTE
                                                  All moral obligation bonds are considered revenue bonds.

                                                       Answer: B. NHAs (or PHAs) are issued to construct, maintain, and improve low-
                                                       income housing. The U.S. government guarantees the rent on these properties. They
                                                       are considered the most secure of all municipal revenue bonds.


                                        Municipal Notes
                                        Municipal anticipation notes are short-term securities that generate funds for a municipality
                                        that expects other revenues soon. Usually, municipal notes have less than 12-month
                                        maturities, although maturities may range from three months to three years. Because of their
                                        short-term nature, interest and principal is paid at maturity. That is just another way of saying
                                        that they are issued at a discount. Municipal notes fall into several categories.
                                         Municipalities issue tax anticipation notes (TANs) to finance current operations in
                                          anticipation of future tax receipts. This helps municipalities to even out cash flow between
                                          tax collection periods.
                                         Revenue anticipation notes (RANs) are offered periodically to finance current operations
                                          in anticipation of future revenues from revenue-producing projects or facilities.
                                         Tax and revenue anticipation notes are a combination of the characteristics of both
                                          TANs and RANs.

                        Bond anticipation notes (BANs) are sold as interim financing that will eventually be
                         converted to long-term funding through a sale of bonds.
                        Tax-exempt commercial paper is often used in place of BANs and TANs for up to 270
                         days, though maturities are most often 30, 60, and 90 days.
                        Construction loan notes (CLNs) are issued to provide interim financing for the                               Unit 6
                         construction of housing projects.
                        Grant anticipation notes are issued with the expectation of receiving grant money from
                         the federal government.

                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                  7.   Which of the following municipal securities would be least likely to be issued at a
                                       discount?
                                        A. BABs
                                        B. BANs

                                        D. RANs
                                       Answer: A. Build America Bonds (BABs) were issued at par. The other choices are
                                       all issued at a discount with the face value being paid at maturity. Test taking note:
                                       Ignore the fact that BABs are no longer issued. In a question like this, FINRA certainly
                                       does.

                       These are municipal debt securities with interest rates that fluctuate based on current market
                       interest rate changes. The MSRB calls these reset securities because the interest rate is reset at
                       certain intervals. The exam may ask you about two types of variable rate securities.


                       Variable Rate Demand Obligations (VRDOs)
                       The MSRB defines variable rate demand obligations (VRDOs) as floating rate obligations that
                       typically have a nominal long-term maturity of 20–30 years, but have an interest rate that is
                       reset periodically. The reset can be daily, weekly, monthly, semiannually, or flexible. Matching
                       the interest rate to market conditions tends to keep the price of these relatively stable.

                       One of the key features of this security is the ability of the investor to demand the issuer
                       repurchase the bonds at par value. This can be done on any reset date. In essence, this is a
                       put option where the investor “puts” the bond and receives the face amount plus any accrued
                       interest. This feature is why VDROs are sometimes considered money market instruments. In
                       fact, you can find them in the portfolio of many money market mutual funds.


                       Auction Rate Securities (ARS)
                       Auction rate securities (ARS) are debt securities that have interest rates that are periodically
                       reset through Dutch auctions, typically every 7, 14, 28, or 35 days. ARS are generally
                       structured as bonds with long-term maturities (20–30 years). Municipalities and public
                       authorities, student loan providers, and other institutional borrowers first began using ARS
                       to raise funds in the 1980s. ARS were marketed to retail investors who were seeking a cash-
                       equivalent investment that paid a higher yield than money market mutual funds or certificates
                       of deposit, although ARS did not have the same level of liquidity as those other instruments.

                                        Following the turmoil in the financial markets that emerged in 2007, interest-rate auctions for
                                        ARS began to fail when the auctions attracted too few bidders. This resulted in an inability
                                        of investors to sell their ARS until there was a successful auction. The ARS market collapsed
                                        in February 2008 when lead underwriters chose not to step in to support the auctions.
                                        For investors, this meant that they were left with illiquid investments with long-term
                                        maturities. There has not been a new issue ARS since 2007, but the amount of outstanding
                                        issues is in the billions of dollars.

                                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  8.   The main advantage of a variable rate municipal bond investment is that
                                                        A. the bond is likely to increase in value.
                                                        B. the bond’s price should remain relatively stable.
                                                        C. the bond is noncallable.
                                                        D. the bond’s interest is exempt from all taxes.
                                                       Answer: B. A variable rate municipal security does not have a fixed coupon rate.
                                                       The interest rate is tied to a market rate (e.g., T-bill yields) and is subject to change at
                                                       regular intervals. Because the interest paid reflects changes in overall interest rates,
                                                       the price of the bond remains relatively close to its par value.


           LESSON 6.3: ANALYSIS OF MUNICIPAL DEBT SECURITIES

                                        LO 6.c Compare the methods of analyzing general obligation (GO) and revenue
                                        bonds.

                                        Different criteria are used to evaluate the merits of GOs and revenue bonds. When analyzing
                                        GOs, investors assess the municipality’s ability to raise enough tax revenue to pay its debt.
                                        Revenue bond debt service depends on the income generated from a specific facility to cover
                                        its operating costs and pay its debt.


                                        GOs Bond Analysis
                                        There are a number of factors that are used to analyze GOs. As you are going through this list,
                                        think about how your personal credit analysis is done. A lender would look at your income,
                                        your net worth, your debt paying history, and your outstanding debt. Those are basically the
                                        first four points we are going to discuss.


                                        Income of the Municipality
                                        Following are the primary sources of municipal income:
                                         Income and sales taxes are major sources of state income.
                                         Real property taxes are the principal income source of counties, and school districts are
                                          the largest source of city income.
                                         City income can include fines, license fees, assessments, sales taxes, hotel taxes, city
                                          income taxes, utility taxes, and any city personal property tax.

                       General Wealth of the Community
                       Because GOs are backed primarily by tax revenues, their safety is determined by the
                       community’s general wealth, which includes the following demographic data:
                        Property values
                        Retail sales per capita                                                                                   Unit 6
                        Local bank deposits
                        Diversity of industry in its tax base
                        Population growth or decline
                       A GO issuer’s taxing power enables it to make principal and interest payments through all but
                       the most unusual economic circumstances.


                       Characteristics of the Issuer
                       A quantitative analysis focuses on objective information regarding a municipality’s
                       population, property values, and per capita income. A qualitative analysis focuses on
                       subjective factors that affect a municipality’s securities. The community’s attitude toward
                       debt and taxation, population trends, property value trends, and plans and projects being
                       undertaken in the area are all relevant considerations.


                       Debt Limits
                       To protect taxpayers from excessive taxes, statutory debt limits may be placed on the overall
                       amount of debt a municipality can have. Suppose a city’s total debt is limited to 5% of the
                       estimated market value of all taxable property within the city’s boundary. The total value
                       of those properties multiplied by 5% would be city’s statutory debt limit. A bond’s official
                       statement discloses how close total outstanding debt, including newly issued debt, comes to
                       its statutory debt limit.

                       A state constitution or city charter can also limit the purposes for which a city may issue
                       bonds. Often, a city may issue bonds to finance capital improvements only if those bonds
                       mature within the expected lifetimes of the improvements. This provision ensures that the city
                       will not owe money on a facility when it becomes obsolete.


                       Ad Valorem Taxes
                       Property taxes are based on a property’s assessed valuation. Assessed valuation is a percentage
                       of the estimated market value. That percentage is established by each state or county and
                       varies substantially. The market value of each piece of property in a county is determined by
                       the county assessor, who relies on recent sale prices of similar properties, income streams,
                       replacement costs, and other information.

                       Because the real property tax is based on the property’s value, it is said to be an ad valorem, or
                       per value, tax. The tax is a lien on the property, which means the property can be seized if the
                       tax is not paid. GOs, backed by the power to tax and seize property, are considered safer than
                       revenue bonds of the same issuer and therefore can be issued with a lower interest rate.

                       Property taxes are generally based on a millage rate. The assessed value is multiplied by that
                       millage rate and the result is the amount of tax. One mill is 1/10 of a cent, or $0.001. Let’s take
                       a look at how this might be asked on the exam.




Series_7_2E.indb 143                                                                                                   11/19/2021 7:52:43 PM
           144         Unit 6   Municipal Bonds



                                                  EXAMPLE
                                                  A taxpayer’s home is currently valued at $400,000. The tax is based on a 50%
                                                  assessment of market value. If the annual tax rate is 7 mills, what is the taxpayer’s
                                                  property tax liability?
                                                  We solve as follows: 50% of the market value is $200,000. That is multiplied by the
                                                  millage rate (0.007). The result is a tax of $1,400. On the exam, you might have choices
                                                  of $140, $1,400, and $14,000. This is one of the few cases where getting the decimal in
                                                  the right place is critical. Try doing it in your head first. A rate of 7 mills is a bit less than
                                                  1%. You could probably figure that 1% of $200,000 is $2,000, so this will be a bit lower.

                                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  9.   A couple’s home has an assessed valuation of $40,000 and a market value of
                                                       $100,000. What will the tax be if a rate of 5 mills is used?
                                                        A. $200
                                                        B. $500
                                                        C. $2,000
                                                        D. $5,000
                                                       Answer: A. Taxes on real property are based on the assessed value assigned to the
                                                       property by the municipality’s tax assessor (in this case, $40,000). Property tax rates
                                                       use the mill (or mil) as a base unit. One mill = $1 of tax per year for each $1,000 of
                                                       assessed value. Five mills would equal $5 for each $1,000 of assessed value. Because
                                                       there are 40,000, 40 × $5 = $200 in annual tax. A short-cut method: take the assessed
                                                       value, remove the last three 0s, and multiply by the number of mills of tax ($40 × 5
                                                       mills = $200).


                                        Analyzing the Official Statement (OS)
                                        As we will learn in Unit 20, municipal bonds provide a form of prospectus, (disclosure
                                        document), known as an official statement (OS). Analysts study the documents included in the
                                        OS to determine the issuer’s financial condition at the present and in the foreseeable future.


                                        Future Financial Needs
                                        The municipality’s financial statements should be scrutinized for signs of future debt
                                        requirements. The municipality might need to issue more debt if
                                         its annual income is not sufficient to make the payments on its short-term (or floating)
                                          debt,
                                         principal repayments are scheduled too close together,
                                         sinking funds for outstanding term bonds are inadequate,
                                         pension liabilities are unfunded, or
                                         it plans to make more capital improvements soon.
                                        Issuing more debt in the near future could damage an issuer’s credit rating, which would cause
                                        the current issue to trade at a lower price.


                                        The Debt Statement
                                        The debt statement is used in the analysis of GO debt. It includes the estimated full valuation
                                        of taxable property, the estimated assessed value of property, and the assessment percentage.

                       To evaluate the municipality’s debt structure, an analyst calculates total debt, the sum of
                       all bonds issued by the municipality, and subtracts self-supporting debt from this figure.
                       Although revenue bond debt is included in total debt, it is backed by revenues from the
                       facility it financed and is not a burden on the municipality’s taxpayers.

                       The result is the municipality’s net direct debt, which includes GOs and short-term notes                    Unit 6
                       issued in anticipation of taxes or for interim financing.

                       Overlapping debt disclosed on the debt statement is the city’s proportionate share of the debts
                       of the county, school district, park district, and sanitary district. The city’s net total debt, also
                       called net overall debt, is the sum of the overlapping debt and the net direct debt.


                       Calculating a Municipality’s Net Total Debt
                       A municipality’s net total debt can be calculated as follows:

                            total debt (all bonds issued by the municipality)
                            – self-supporting debt
                            – sinking fund accumulations
                            = net direct debt
                            + overlapping debt
                            = net total debt

                                  TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                  A question might ask about what is or is not included in the various categories on the
                                  debt statement. A good rule: for any category that uses the word net, self-supporting
                                  debt and sinking fund accumulations are not included. For instance, net total debt
                                  includes all GOs and overlapping debt but does not include the self-supporting and
                                  sinking fund accumulations.
                                  Do not expect a calculation question on this topic. The exam will only test your
                                  understanding of the concept.


                       Revenue Bond Analysis
                       Revenue bonds are rated according to a facility’s potential to generate sufficient money to
                       cover operating expenses and principal and interest payments. Revenue bonds are not repaid
                       from taxes, so they are not subject to statutory debt limits. Revenue bonds are meant to be
                       self-supporting, and if the facility they finance does not make enough money to repay the
                       debts, the bondholders, not the taxpayers, bear the risk. When assessing the quality of revenue
                       bonds, an investor should consider the following factors:
                        Economic justification. The facility being built should be able to generate revenues.
                        Competing facilities. A facility should not be placed where better alternatives are easily
                         available.
                        Sources of revenue. The sources should be dependable.
                        Call provisions. With callable bonds, the higher the call premium, the more attractive a
                         bond is to an investor.
                        Flow of funds. Revenues generated must be sufficient to pay all of the facility’s operating
                         expenses and to meet debt service obligation.

                                        Applications of Revenues
                                        Principal and interest on revenue bonds are paid exclusively from money generated by the
                                        facility the issuer finances. The issuer pledges to pay expenses in a specific order, called the
                                        flow of funds.

                                        In most cases, a net revenue pledge is used, meaning that operating and maintenance
                                        expenses are paid first. The remaining funds (or net revenues) are used to pay debt service and
                                        meet other obligations.


                                        Flow of Funds in a Net Revenue Pledge
                                        In a net revenue pledge, total receipts from operating the facility are usually deposited in the
                                        revenue fund, and funds are disbursed as follows:
                                         Operations and maintenance. Used to pay current operating and maintenance expenses;
                                          remaining funds are called net revenues.
                                         Debt service account. Used to pay the interest and principal maturing in the current year
                                          and serves as a sinking fund for term issues.
                                         Debt service reserve fund. Used to hold enough money to pay one year’s debt service.
                                         Reserve maintenance fund. Used to supplement the general maintenance fund.
                                         Renewal and replacement fund. Used to create reserve funds for major renewal projects and
                                          equipment replacements.
                                         Surplus (sinking) fund. Used for a variety of purposes, such as redeeming bonds or paying
                                          for improvements.

                                        If the issuer has not pledged to pay operating and maintenance expenses first, debt service
                                        is the priority expense. When debt service is paid first, the flow of funds is called a gross
                                        revenue pledge.

                                        The debt service includes current principal and interest due, plus any sinking fund
                                        obligations. If revenues exceed operating and other obligations, the money is usually placed in
                                        a surplus fund.

                                                   If you see questions that require differentiating gross revenue and net revenue
                                                   pledges, maybe this will help: the name of the pledge tells you how debt service
                                                   is paid. In a gross revenue pledge, debt service is paid first, from gross revenues.
                                                   Operations and maintenance expenses are paid after debt service. In a net revenue
                                                   pledge, debt service is paid from the net revenues, meaning operations and
                                                   maintenance costs are paid first. This is the more common of the two pledges. Think
                                                   of this as the difference between your gross pay and your net check. Before you get

                                                   premiums, are deducted.

                                    When analyzing revenue bonds, one should look at the debt coverage ratio. It is the
                                    ratio of available revenues available annually to pay the debt service divided by the
                                    annual debt service requirement. The higher the ratio, the better. It looks like this:

              LESSON 6.4: MUNICIPAL BOND MARKETABILITY

                         LO 6.d Recognize the factors affecting the marketability of municipal bonds.



                         Municipal Bond Marketability Factors
                         The MSRB defines marketability as, “the ease or difficulty with which securities can be sold
                         in the market. A municipal security’s marketability depends upon many factors, including its
                         coupon, yield, dollar price, security provisions, maturity, credit quality, and rating, if any. In
                         the case of a new issue, marketability also depends on the size of the issue, the timing of its
                         issuance and the volume of comparable issues being sold.” We are going to look at the most
                         tested of these including some listed by FINRA that are not in the MSRB’s definition.


                         Rating
                         Simply stated, the higher the rating, the more marketable the bond. Many large institutional
                         investors, such as banks and insurance companies, are generally limited to investment-grade
                         debt. In some cases, they are limited to the top two grades (AA or Aa). As the number of
                         potential investors increases, so does the marketability.


                         Maturity
                         In general, the shorter the time until maturity, the more marketable the bond.


                         Coupon
                         In general, the higher the coupon, the more marketable the bond.


                         Block Size
                         The typical block for a municipal bond trade is $100,000. Trades in smaller amounts are not
                         as marketable.

                                        Call Features
                                        The longer the call protection, the more marketable the bond. That means noncallable bonds
                                        are the most marketable.


                                        Dollar Price
                                        In general, bonds with a lower dollar price are more marketable.


                                        Refunding
                                        In the securities industry, the term refunding is most like refinancing a loan, such as a
                                        mortgage. When interest rates fall, the municipality issues a new bond (at lower rates). Then
                                        they use the proceeds from the new bond to pay off the old, higher interest debt. There are
                                        two types of refunding.


                                        Advance Refunding (Prerefunding)
                                        This is refinancing an existing municipal bond issue before its maturity or call date by using
                                        money from the sale of a new bond issue. The proceeds of the new bond issue are used to
                                        purchase special government securities. To comply with the complex restrictions imposed
                                        by the IRS, the municipality places the proceeds of a municipal pre-refunding in an escrow
                                        account that immediately invests in state and local government securities series. These
                                        are U.S. government securities issued directly by the Treasury to municipal issuers only
                                        in connection with prerefundings. They are usually referred to by the acronym SLGS and
                                        pronounced “slugs”. The municipality then uses these funds to pay off the original bond issue
                                        at the first call date.


                                        Current Refunding
                                        This differs from advance refunding in that the old bonds will be redeemed within 90 days or
                                        less from the date of issuance of the refunding bonds.

                                        In either case, refunding increases the quality of the bonds. This leads to greater marketability.


                                        Municipal Bond Insurance
                                        Municipal bond issuers can insure their securities’ principal and interest payments by buying
                                        insurance from a number of insurers. This will generally improve the marketability of the
                                        bond. Among those specializing in insuring municipal issues are National Public Finance
                                        Guarantee Corp. (formerly the Municipal Bond Investors Assurance Corporation—MBIA),
                                        Financial Guaranty Insurance Company, Assured Guaranty Corporation, and AMBAC
                                        Indemnity Corporation. While AMBAC is not currently insuring new municipal issues, there
                                        are many AMBAC-insured municipal bonds still outstanding.

                                        Insured bonds are generally issued with lower coupon rates because investors will accept lower
                                        rates of return for the added safety insurance affords. In addition, the cost of insurance may
                                        also lessen the yield a municipal issuer is willing to pay. Many small issues of municipal bonds
                                        are not rated because of the cost to rate a bond can be expensive. Instead, many issuers will
                                        insure the bond for principal and/or interest. When a bond is insured, MSRB rules require of
                                        the certificates accompanied by evidence of insurance, either on the face of the certificates or
                                        in a separate document.

                       The effect of the bond insurance is that both interest and principal will be paid as scheduled,
                       over time through the life of the bond. The idea is that the bondholder should not see a
                       problem. The insurer will just take up the liability and run with it not missing a beat.


                                                                                                                                   Unit 6
                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                  10. When the issuer of an insured municipal bond defaults, what does the insurance
                                      company do?
                                       A. Both principal and interest are returned over the remaining term of the bond.
                                       B. Principal is returned immediately and the interest is paid out based upon the
                                          normal schedule.
                                       C. Only the principal is returned with the bondholder losing the interest.
                                       D. Both principal and remaining interest payments are paid immediately to the
                                          bondholder.
                                      Answer: A. Both interest and principal will be paid as scheduled, over time
                                      through the life of the bond. It is not paid out as a lump sum. An investor won’t
                                      even notice the difference because the interest checks will come the same way they
                                      always did.


                       Fair Prices and Commissions Rule G-30
                       Just as corporate securities follow the FINRA 5% policy, municipal securities come under
                       MSRB’s Rule G-30 with similar characteristics. Remember, municipal securities are exempt
                       from the FINRA policy. That fact is frequently tested on the exam. Similar to FINRA
                       rules, broker-dealers cannot charge a commission and a markup or markdown on the same
                       transaction.

                       You might be thinking, “Why are you covering this here?” Good question. The reason is
                       that the marketability of a municipal bond plays a key role in determining fair prices and
                       commissions.

                       The MSRB rule states the markups or markdowns or commissions that municipal securities
                       dealers charge must be fair and reasonable and listed on the customer confirmation, taking
                       into account all characteristics of a trade, such as:
                        FMV of the securities at trade time;
                        total dollar amount of the transaction;
                        any special difficulty in doing the trade; and
                        the fact that the dealer is entitled to a profit.
                       Block size certainly affects the total dollar amount of the trade as well as the ease with which
                       the trade is made. As a general rule, the more marketable the municipal security, the lower
                       the profit to the municipal dealer. It is similar to so many things we buy in our everyday lives.
                       Many of the items in our grocery stores, such as milk, bread and eggs have very low markup
                       because they move off the shelves rapidly. When it comes to items that sell rarely, like antiques
                       and fine art, the markups are quite significant.

                       Reasonable compensation differs from fair pricing. A dealer could limit its profit on a
                       transaction to a reasonable level and still violate this rule if the dealer fails to consider market
                       value. For example, a dealer may fail to check the market value of a security when acquiring
                       it from another dealer or customer. This could result in the firm paying a price well above
                       market value. It would be a violation of fair-pricing responsibilities for the dealer to pass on
                       this misjudgment to another customer, even if the dealer makes little or no profit on the trade.

                                        Broker’s Broker
                                        There are certain firms in the municipal securities business that do not position trade (keep
                                        an inventory of ) bonds. Rather, they exist to assist other firms find buyers or sellers of
                                        municipal bonds. They perform this duty in both primary and secondary market transactions.
                                        These firms are known as a broker’s broker. The term is appropriate because these firms deal
                                        primarily with other municipal securities firms acting as their agents. They will also represent
                                        institutions, but never have any dealings with public customers. A major reason these firms
                                        exist is because the market for most municipal bonds is quite thin. That means not a lot of
                                        trading going on. Here is an example of how a broker’s broker might perform.

                                                  EXAMPLE
                                                  Your broker-dealer specializes in mutual funds. From time to time, it has a customer
                                                  wishing to make a small purchase of municipal bonds. One of your firm’s clients has
                                                  just inherited $500,000 in State M general obligation bonds and wishes to sell them.
                                                  The size of this trade is far beyond anything your firm is capable of placing. Your firm
                                                  needs help in finding buyers for these bonds so it turns to a broker’s broker. Acting on
                                                  behalf of your firm as its agent, the broker’s broker knows the marketplace and which
                                                  municipal dealers or institutions might be suitable candidates for those GO bonds. For
                                                  performing in this role, the broker’s broker earns a commission.

                                                  TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                  One of the features of using a broker’s broker is anonymity. Your firm does not disclose
                                                  the identity of your customer and the broker’s broker does not disclose the identity of
                                                  the buyer of your client’s bonds.



           LESSON 6.5: MUNICIPAL BOND MATH

                                        LO 6.e Perform the various municipal bond calculations.



                                        Key Municipal Bond Calculations
                                        Many of the municipal bond calculations are the same as those covered with corporate bonds.
                                        Those include
                                         nominal (coupon) yield,
                                         current yield (CY),
                                         yield to maturity (YTM),
                                         yield to call, and
                                         accrued interest.


                                        Computing Accrued Interest
                                        Back in Lesson 4.1, we described accrued interest and commented that we would get to it
                                        again in this unit. Computing accrued interest on a bond appears on most exams.

                                        Rules for calculating municipal bond accrued interest are the same as they are for corporate
                                        bonds.




Series_7_2E.indb 150                                                                                                                    11/19/2021 7:52:43 PM
                                                                                           Unit 6   Municipal Bonds   151


                      Unless a bond is trading flat (discussed later), the bond cost to the buyer and the proceeds to
                      the seller include accrued interest. Accrued interest increases the bond cost to the buyer and
                      the proceeds to the seller.

                      Accrued interest is calculated from the last interest payment date up to but not including
                      the settlement date (two business days after the trade date). The buyer owns the bond on the                Unit 6
                      settlement date, which means that the interest starting from that day belongs to the buyer and
                      the previous six months interest is credited to the seller.


                      The Calculation
                      The calculation to determine accrued interest assumes all months—even February—have 30
                      days. All corporate, government agency issues, and municipal bonds use the 30-day-month
                      count. Therefore, for purposes of this calculation, the year contains 360 days. Treasury notes
                      and bonds accrue interest "actual/actual". That is, the year has 365 days and each month is
                      either 30 or 31, except for February.

                                EXAMPLE
                                If an F&A municipal bond is traded regular way on Monday, March 5, the number of
                                days of accrued interest is calculated as follows:
                                February                   30 days
                                March 5 trade               6 days (settles T+2 regular way March 7)
                                Days of accrued interest   36 days
                                Because the trade settles on March 7, six days of interest accrue for March. Remember:
                                up to but not including the settlement date. There is a form of trade settlement
                                known as for cash. In that case, the settlement date is the trade date. In this example,
                                settlement for cash would be March 5. Therefore, calculating up to but not including
                                the settlement date, the days of accrued interest for March would be four, making the
                                total days of accrued interest 34.

                                TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                Recap for calculating accrued interest follows.
                                    Corporate, agencies, and municipals: use 30-day months (360-day year)
                                    U.S. Treasury securities: use actual day months (365-day year)
                                When counting days:
                                    Go back and include the last interest payment date.
                                    Go up to but not including the settlement date.

                                TAKE NOTE
                                A method using actual calendar days (365-day year) is used only on U.S. government
                                bonds (not corporates, agencies, or municipals).

                                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  11. At settlement, accrued interest
                                                       A. increases the amount the buyer must pay and decreases the amount the seller
                                                            will receive.
                                                       B. decreases the amount the buyer must pay and increases the amount the seller
                                                            will receive.
                                                       C. decreases the amount the buyer must pay and decreases the amount the
                                                            seller will receive.
                                                       D. increases the amount the buyer must pay and increases the amount the seller
                                                            will receive.
                                                       Answer: D. Remember, at settlement, buyers pay any accrued interest due and
                                                       sellers receive the accrued interest. Therefore, any accrued interest will increase the
                                                       amount the buyer must pay and increase the amount the seller will receive.


                                        Accrued Interest and the Dated Date
                                        For a new bond issue, the date from which interest accrual begins is called the dated date.
                                        Even if a bond is issued at a later date, the bond starts accruing interest on the date designated
                                        as the dated date. For example, if the bond’s dated date is April 1 and the interest payment
                                        dates are June 1 and December 1, the first interest payment will be on December 1 and will
                                        be for eight months of interest. This first payment is called a long coupon.

                                        When a debt security is trading flat, it means no accrued interest is included in the
                                        transaction. In most cases, this occurs when the issuer is in default of interest payments. Of
                                        course, this is also the case with zero coupon bonds because there is no interest being paid.
                                        All bonds paying semiannual interest trade flat twice each year. When the trade takes place so
                                        that it settles on an interest payment date, there is no accrued interest because the seller will
                                        receive a check from the issuer for the interest. We liken that to the broken clock that shows
                                        the correct time twice a day.


                                        Adjusting the Cost Basis of Municipal Bonds
                                        Upon disposition of a municipal bond, either with a sale or redemption at maturity or call,
                                        determining if an investor has a capital gain or capital loss requires knowing the cost basis. If
                                        and how cost basis is adjusted for municipal bonds depends first on if the bond was purchased
                                        at a premium or a discount.


                                        Municipal Bonds Purchased at a Premium
                                        The purchaser of a municipal bond at a premium must amortize the premium on a straight-
                                        line basis over the remaining life of the bond. It makes no difference if the bond was
                                        purchased as a new issue or in the secondary market. Straight-line amortization means that an
                                        equal amount of the premium will be amortized each year the bond is held.

                                   EXAMPLE
                                   A customer buys an 8% municipal bond with eight years to maturity at a price of $108.
                                   The premium of eight points ($80) must be amortized over the remaining eight years
                                   to maturity. The annual amortization amount is one point, or $10 per bond. After one

                                                                                                                                       Unit 6
                                   year, the cost basis is 107; after two years, 106; and so on. If held to maturity, there is
                                   no capital loss because the cost basis at that time has been reduced to par.
                       Amortization
                        reduces cost basis and
                        reduces reported interest income.
                       In the example, cost basis is reduced each year by $10 per bond. This adjustment to the
                       cost basis affects any capital gain or capital loss realized if the investor sells the bond before
                       the maturity date. Because interest income on municipal bonds is not taxed, its annual
                       amortization has no tax effect.

                       If the bond is sold before maturity, gain or loss is the difference between sales price and
                       adjusted cost basis. Take the following example. A customer buys a five-year municipal bond
                       at 105. Two years later, the bond is sold at 104. What is the customer’s gain or loss?

                       The premium of five points must be amortized over a five-year period, so the annual
                       amortization is one point, or $10 per bond. After two years, the bond’s cost basis is 103.
                       Therefore, a sale at 104 creates a one-point capital gain per bond.


                       Municipal Bonds Purchased at a Discount
                       If a municipal bond is bought at a discount, the discount is accreted. Accretion is the process
                       of adjusting the cost basis back up to par. It is the reverse computation of amortization.
                       However, the tax treatment is a bit more complicated. The actual tax effect of accretion
                       depends on whether the bond was purchased as an original issue discount (OID) (i.e., a new
                       issue being offered at a discount) or an issue purchased at a discount in the secondary market.
                       We will cover OID bonds later in this lesson.
                       Accretion
                        increases cost basis and
                        increases reported interest income.

                                   EXAMPLE
                                   A customer buys a 5% municipal bond at 90 maturing in 10 years. The amount of the
                                   annual accretion is $10 per bond (10-point discount ÷ 10 years). Each year, the cost
                                   basis is adjusted upward by $10. At maturity, there is no reported capital gain.

                                   EXAMPLE
                                   Assume a customer buys a 5% municipal bond with a 10-year maturity at 90 in the
                                   secondary market. Five years later, the customer sells the bond at 97. What are the tax
                                   consequences? The annual accretion of $10 per bond is taxable each year as ordinary
                                   income. The customer’s cost basis at the time of sale is 95. When sold at 97, the
                                   customer has a capital gain of $20 per bond.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   12. An investor purchases a 5% municipal bond in the secondary market at 90. With 10
                                                       years left to maturity, the annual accretion and capital gain at maturity is
                                                        A. zero, with no capital gain at maturity.
                                                        B. zero, with a $100 capital gain at maturity.
                                                        C. $10 per bond, with no capital gain at maturity.
                                                        D. $10 per bond, with a $100 capital gain at maturity.
                                                       Answer: C. One bond point equals $10. A 10-point discount represents a $100
                                                       discount. One hundred dollars divided by 10 years to maturity equals $10 accretion
                                                       each year. With the accretion taxed each year, there is no capital gain reported at
                                                       maturity.


           LESSON 6.6: MUNICIPAL BOND TAX CALCULATIONS

                                        LO 6.f Differentiate between the different kinds of tax treatment of municipal
                                        securities.

                                        One of the significant features of municipal bonds is how they are treated for tax purposes.
                                        We will look at all of the tax possibilities that may be on the exam.


                                        Interest Payments
                                        In almost every case, the interest on a municipal security is exempt from federal income tax.
                                        That is why these are called tax-exempt or tax-free investments. Because of this favorable tax
                                        treatment, municipal issuers are able to borrow at a lower interest cost. In fact, the interest is
                                        usually lower than on a U.S. government bond.

                                        The Tax Reform Act of 1986 restricted the federal income tax exemption of interest for
                                        municipal bonds to public purpose bonds, which are bonds issued to finance projects that
                                        benefit citizens in general rather than particular private interests. If a bond directs more
                                        than 10% of its proceeds to private parties, it is considered a private activity bond and is not
                                        automatically granted tax exemption.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   Unless stated to the contrary (unlikely), you can safely assume that any GO bond on
                                                   the exam is for a public purpose (they’re using your property taxes—it better be).


                                        Calculating Tax Benefits
                                        As stated earlier, in most cases, interest received from municipal bonds is free of federal
                                        income tax. Furthermore, if the investor resides in the issuer’s state, it is generally free of state
                                        income tax as well.

                                        Assume an investor has $2,000 to invest. If she purchases at par one corporate or government
                                        bond of standard size ($1,000) with a 10% nominal (coupon) yield, she would receive $100
                                        per year, paid by two semiannual interest checks of $50. For purposes of this example, assume
                                        that she is in the 28% federal income tax bracket. An individual in the 28% tax bracket pays
                                        tax on any additional income earned at a rate of 28%. Therefore, on the $100 in interest she
                                        received earlier, she would pay the IRS $28 (28%) and keep the other $72.

                                                                                             Unit 6   Municipal Bonds      155


                       The other $1,000 she had available to invest was used to purchase a $1,000‑par value
                       municipal bond with a 7.5% nominal yield. She would receive $75 annually on that bond
                       paid, by two semiannual interest checks of $37.50. The 10% bonds, on which the interest
                       is taxable, would net $72 per year after taxes. Of the $75 interest received for the 7.5%
                       municipal, none of it is taxed—the whole amount is kept. Therefore, a client in the 28%
                       bracket should purchase 7.5% municipals before 10% corporates. The taxable equivalent yield                  Unit 6
                       of a 7.5% tax-free bond for this investor in the 28% tax bracket would be the tax-free yield
                       divided by (100% minus the tax bracket). In this case, 7.5 ÷ (100 – 28), or 0.72. That equals
                       10.42%, so it is obvious that the 7.5% municipal bond will provide a higher after-tax return.
                       When answering a tax-equivalent yield question, keep in mind that the municipal yield will
                       always be lower than the taxable bond.

                                 TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                 The tax-equivalent yield for a municipal bond issued by an entity within a state with
                                 a state income tax will have a higher tax-equivalent yield to a resident of that state
                                 because of the “double” tax exemption.

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 The formula for computing tax-equivalent yield is municipal bond coupon divided by
                                 (100% – investor’s tax bracket).
                                 Therefore, if the coupon rate (nominal yield) of the municipal bond is 4.2% and
                                 the investor is in the 40% tax bracket, you would divide 4.2% by (100% – 40%) or
                                 4.2% by 60% and arrive at a tax-equivalent yield of 7%. That is, to receive the same
                                 after-tax benefit, this investor would have to purchase a taxable bond (corporate or
                                 government) with a coupon of 7%. This can be easily proven by taking the 7% yield
                                 and reducing it by the 40% tax which results in 7% – 2.8% tax, or 4.2%.

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 13. An investor in the 27% federal income tax bracket invests in municipal general
                                     obligation (GO) public purpose bonds with a coupon yield of 4.5%. What is the tax-
                                     equivalent yield?
                                      A. 4.36%
                                      B. 2.70%
                                      C. 5.72%
                                      D. 6.16%
                                      Answer: D. The formula for computing tax-equivalent yield is: nominal yield divided
                                      by (1 − federal income tax rate) 0.045 ÷ (1 − 0.27) = 6.16%. You can quickly eliminate
                                      the two choices less than 4.5%. The tax-equivalent yield is always higher than the
                                      municipal coupon. Then you can take the remaining choices and subtract 27% in tax
                                      to see which one comes out to 4.5%.


                                 TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                 For exam purposes, you never recommend municipal bonds to investors unless they
                                 are in the higher tax brackets. Any question dealing with a low tax bracket client will
                                 never have a municipal bond as a suitable recommendation.


                       Original Issue Discount (OID) Bonds
                       It is not unusual to have a municipal bond issued at a discount on its initial public offering.
                       The reasons for this are beyond the scope of the exam. The tax consequences, however, are

                                        not. As we learned previously, when a municipal bond is bought in the secondary markets at
                                        a discount, that discount is accreted on a straight-line basis. What’s more, that accretion is
                                        considered taxable income. As with any other municipal bond, the coupon interest is tax-free.

                                        In the case of an OID bond, the IRS considers the discount to be part of the issuer’s payment
                                        of interest. Therefore, the accretion on an OID bond is tax-free. Let’s look at an example.

                                                  EXAMPLE
                                                  An investor buys a newly issued 5% municipal bond with 10 years to maturity at 90.
                                                  Because the bond was purchased as an OID, the reported interest income would
                                                  be $60 per bond ($50 plus the annual accretion of $10). Because interest income on
                                                  municipal bonds is tax-free, the accretion has no tax effect.
                                        Just as with the secondary market purchase of a bond at a discount, the annual accretion
                                        increases the investor’s cost basis.

                                                  EXAMPLE
                                                  An investor buys a newly issued 5% municipal bond with 10 years to maturity at 90.
                                                  Five years later, the customer sells the bond at 97. What are the tax consequences?
                                                  The annual accretion of $10 per bond adds to the investor’s cost basis. It is not taxable
                                                  as income. Five years of $10 per year accretion brings the investor’s cost basis at the
                                                  time of sale to 95. When sold at 97, the customer has a capital gain of $20 per bond.


                                        Municipal Bond Capital Gains and Capital Losses
                                        When it comes to capital gains and losses, municipal bonds are treated like any other
                                        investment. That is, if the bond is sold for more than its cost (including those bonds where
                                        the cost basis is adjusted), there is a capital gain. If sold below cost (including those bonds
                                        where the premium is amortized), there is a capital loss. Furthermore, the gains and losses are
                                        either long-term (more than 12 months) or short-term, just like other securities.

                                                  TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                  Because the test authors know that students tend to focus on the tax-free income of
                                                  municipal bonds, they write questions hoping you will answer that the capital gains
                                                  are tax-free as well. That is not so.

                                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  14. An investor purchases 100 original issue discount (OID) municipal bonds at 95 with a
                                                      10-year maturity. If the bonds are held to maturity, the investor’s tax consequences
                                                      are
                                                       A. $5,000 ordinary income.
                                                       B. $5,000 tax-free income.
                                                       C. $5,000 long-term capital gain.
                                                       D. $4,000 long-term capital gain and $1,000 short-term capital gain.
                                                      Answer: B. When an investor purchases OID securities and then holds them to
                                                      maturity, the appreciation or accretion is treated as interest income. On a municipal
                                                      security, this interest income is tax-free. However, when purchasing a municipal
                                                      security in the secondary market at a discount, the accretion is taxed as ordinary
                                                      income.

                       AMT Bonds
                       Technically, industrial revenue bonds are issued for a corporation’s benefit. Under the Tax
                       Reform Act of 1986, the interest on these nonpublic purpose bonds (or private purpose
                       bonds) may be taxable because the act reserves tax exemption for public purposes. Because
                                                                                                                                     Unit 6
                       these bonds are used for a nonpublic purpose, the interest income may be subject to the
                       alternative minimum tax (AMT).

                       Congress enacted the AMT in 1969 to make certain that high-income taxpayers do not escape
                       paying taxes. Certain items receive favorable tax treatment. These items must be added back
                       into taxable income for the AMT. These tax preference items include
                        tax-exempt interest on private purpose, nonessential government service municipal bonds;
                        certain costs associated with direct participation programs (DPPs), such as research and
                         development costs and excess intangible drilling costs;
                        local taxes (e.g., state income and property) and interest on investments that do not
                         generate income; and
                        accelerated depreciation on investment property.
                       We will cover some of these preference items in the appropriate units. At this time, you need
                       to know that private purpose municipal bonds are included in the list.

                                  TAKE NOTE
                                  The language of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) says that taxpayers are required to
                                  add the excess of the AMT over the regular tax to determine their total tax liability.


                       Taxable Municipal Bonds
                       There are municipal bonds where the interest is not tax-exempt. The most notable case is the
                       Build America Bonds (BABs). We don’t expect any other examples to appear on your exam.


                       Build America Bonds (BABs)
                       BABs were created under the Economic Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 to assist in
                       reducing costs to issuing municipalities and stimulating the economy. While bonds to fund
                       municipal projects have traditionally been sold in the tax-exempt arena, BABs are taxable
                       obligations. Bondholders pay tax on interest received from BABs. However, tax credits are
                       provided in lieu of the tax-exempt status usually afforded the interest on municipal securities.
                       These bonds attracted investors who would normally not buy tax-exempt municipal bonds
                       and expanded the pool of investors to include those in lower-income tax brackets, investors
                       funding retirement accounts where tax-free securities would normally not be suitable, public
                       pension funds, and foreign investors. There are two types of BABs issued: tax credit BABs and
                       direct payment BABs.


                       Tax Credit BABs
                       These types of BABs provide the bondholder with a federal income tax credit equal to 35% of
                       the interest paid on the bond in each tax year. If the bondholder lacks sufficient tax liability to
                       fully use that year’s credit, the excess credit may be carried forward.

                                       Direct payment BABs provide no credit to the bondholder but instead provide the municipal
                                       issuer with payments from the U.S. Treasury equal to 35% of the interest paid by the issuer.

                                                 The BABs program expired on December 31, 2010, without being renewed. However,
                                                 in the short time that municipalities were permitted to issue BABs, billions of dollars of
                                                 capital had been raised to fund municipal projects throughout the United States, and
                                                 many of these issues will remain outstanding for a number of years. Finally, it should
                                                 be noted that the program could be reinstated in the future, and the types of BABs
                                                 offered and the credits they provide could be amended as well.


           LESSON 6.7: MUNICIPAL FUND SECURITIES

                                       LO 6.g Identify the types of municipal fund securities.

                                       There are several investments that one would not think of as being municipal securities. These
                                       are the municipal fund securities (nothing to do with a mutual fund) as defined in Rule D-12
                                       and are regulated by the MSRB.


                                       Section 529 Plans—Qualified Tuition Programs (QTPs)
                                       Section 529 plans are a tax-advantaged savings plan offering benefits to those saving for
                                       future education costs. These plans are generally under the auspices of states or their agencies
                                       and are technically considered municipal fund securities.

                                       There are two basic types of 529 plans: prepaid tuition plans and education savings plans.
                                       Both plans are funded with after-tax dollars, and earnings grow tax-deferred. Withdrawals
                                       taken for qualified education expenses are generally tax-free. If the money is used for anything
                                       other than qualified education expenses, the earnings portion of the distribution will be
                                       taxable on the federal (and possibly state) income tax return in the year of the distribution.
                                       Also, there is a 10% tax penalty on the earnings portion of your distribution. There are a
                                       couple of exceptions to the 10% penalty. The penalty is usually not charged if you terminate
                                       the account because your beneficiary died or became disabled. The penalty is also waived if
                                       you withdraw funds not needed for college because your beneficiary received a scholarship.
                                       Any person can open a 529 plan for a future student; the donor does not have to be related to
                                       the student.

                                       Prepaid tuition plans allow donors to lock in future tuition rates at today’s prices, thus
                                       offering inflation protection.

                                       The education savings plan allows the donor to invest a lump sum or make periodic
                                       payments. The money is typically invested into target-date funds. As the target date
                                       approaches (the date the money is needed) the portfolio gets more conservative. When the
                                       student is ready for college, the donor withdraws the amount needed to pay for qualified
                                       education expenses (e.g., tuition, room and board, and books). These plans do have
                                       investment risk. In other words, they can lose money.

                                       Under the TCJA of 2017, starting in 2018, up to $10,000 per year can be used for K–12
                                       tuition purposes.

                      Other points to note include the following:
                       College savings plans (but not prepaid tuition plans) may be set up in more than one
                        state, though the allowable contribution amount varies from state to state.
                       As of the date of this printing, the total allowable contribution varies from a low of
                        $235,000 to a high of $529,000.                                                                        Unit 6
                       There are no age limitations for contributions or distributions.
                       There are no income limitations on making contributions to a 529 plan.
                       Contributions may be made in the form of periodic payments, but contributions follow
                        the tax rules for gifts. Thus, unless willing to pay a gift tax, contributions are limited to
                        an indexed maximum amount ($16,000 in 2022) per year per donor. Section 529 plans
                        have a five-year election that allows a donor to contribute five times that amount in one
                        year (a spouse can do the same to the same recipient), but then they may make no more
                        contributions for five years.
                       There are few restrictions on who may be the first beneficiary of a 529 plan. However, if
                        the beneficiary is redesignated, the new beneficiary must be a close family member of the
                        first.
                       Just as with other municipal securities, an OS must be delivered to prospective investors.
                      The assets in the account remain the property of the donor, even after the beneficiary reaches
                      legal age. However, if the account is not used for higher education, and the IRS concludes
                      that the plan was not established in good faith, it may impose fines and other sanctions. This
                      would generally mean the earnings in the account are taxed at ordinary income rates with an
                      additional 10% penalty.

                      Plan assets remain outside the owner’s estate for estate tax purposes.

                                TAKE NOTE
                                Because 529s are state-sponsored, individual states have their own version of the
                                plan. The exam does not expect you to have knowledge of specific state plans, only
                                characteristics of the plan in general.


                      Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) Accounts
                      Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) accounts are tax-advantaged savings accounts for
                      individuals with disabilities and their families. They were created as a result of the passage
                      of the ABLE Act of 2014. The beneficiary of the account is the account owner and income
                      earned by the account is not taxed.

                      The ABLE Act limits eligibility to individuals with significant disabilities where the age of
                      onset of the disability occurred before turning age 26. One need not be under the age of 26
                      to be eligible to establish an ABLE account. One could be over the age of 26, but as long as
                      the onset of the disability occurred before age 26, the person is eligible to establish an ABLE
                      account.

                      If an individual meets the age/onset criteria and is also receiving benefits either through Social
                      Security insurance and/or Social Security disability insurance, the individual is automatically
                      eligible to establish an ABLE account. Only one ABLE account per person is allowed.

                      Contributions to these accounts, which can be made by any person including the account
                      beneficiaries themselves, as well as family and friends, must be made using after-tax dollars
                      and is not tax deductible for purposes of federal income taxes. Some states, however, do




Series7_06.indd 159                                                                                                     19/05/22 1:00 PM

                                        allow income tax deductions for contributions made to an ABLE account. Contributions by
                                        all participating individuals are limited to a specified dollar amount per year, which may be
                                        adjusted periodically to account for inflation.


                                        Local Government Investment Pools (LGIPs)
                                        States establish local government investment pools (LGIPs) to provide other government
                                        entities—such as cities, counties, school districts, or other state agencies—with a short-
                                        term investment vehicle to invest funds. The LGIPs are generally formed as a trust in which
                                        municipalities can purchase shares or units in the LGIP’s investment portfolio.

                                        While not a money market fund, most LGIPs operate similar to one. For instance, an LGIP
                                        may be permitted to maintain a fixed $1 net asset value (NAV). Maintaining a stable NAV,
                                        similar to a money market mutual fund, facilitates liquidity and minimum price volatility.

                                        LGIPs are not required to register with the SEC and are not subject to the SEC’s regulatory
                                        requirements, given that LGIPs fall within the governmental exemption, just as municipal
                                        securities do. Therefore, investment guidelines and oversight for LGIPs can vary from state to
                                        state.

                                        With no SEC registration required, there is no prospectus. However, LGIP programs do have
                                        disclosure documents, which generally include information statements, and investment policy
                                        and operating procedures. The information statement typically details the management fees
                                        associated with participation in the LGIP.

                                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  15. While in your office, you see that your firm is going to be holding a training session
                                                      on municipal fund securities. You wish to attend because you are interested in being
                                                      able to speak intelligently to your clients about
                                                       A. the difference between GOs and revenue bonds.
                                                       B. the difference between using mutual funds or UITs to invest in municipal
                                                            bonds.
                                                       C. Section 529 plans.
                                                       D. Section 457plans.
                                                      Answer: C. The SEC has stated that certain Section 529 College Savings Plans
                                                      established by states or local governmental entities are municipal fund securities.
                                                      Accordingly, the purchase and sale of state-sponsored Section 529 plans are
                                                      governed by the rules of the MSRB.


           LESSON 6.8: MSRB RULES

                                        LO 6.h Determine the rules and regulations pertaining to the sale of municipal
                                        securities.

                                        Rules and regulations applicable to all firms and individuals having to do with municipal
                                        securities are written by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB). MSRB
                                        rules are heavily tested on the exam. In many cases, the rules are the same as FINRAs. Where
                                        they are different, we will note it for you. Most of the rules, as with FINRA and SEC rules,
                                        are sprinkled throughout the course and covered in the appropriate units. One other point
                                        about MSRB rules is that the rule number frequently appears in a test question. It is not




Series_7_2E.indb 160                                                                                                                        11/19/2021 7:52:44 PM
                                                                                           Unit 6   Municipal Bonds     161


                       required that you memorize those numbers. For example, the question might be worded:
                       “Under MSRB Rule G-9, records of customer complaints must be preserved for at least?”
                       The question makes it clear the topic is recordkeeping (the substance of G-9). Because of the
                       propensity to include those numbers, we will as well, as you should have already noticed.

                                                                                                                                  Unit 6
                       MSRB
                       The Securities Acts Amendments of 1975 established the MSRB as an independent self-
                       regulatory organization (SRO). The MSRB governs the issuance and trading of municipal
                       securities. The rules require municipal securities underwriters and dealers to protect investors’
                       interests, be ethical in offering advice, and be responsive to complaints and disputes. The
                       MSRB rules apply to all firms and individuals engaged in the conduct of municipal securities
                       business. The MSRB does not regulate issuers.


                       Rule Enforcement
                       The MSRB has no authority to enforce the rules it makes. While the SEC oversees all
                       securities-related rule enforcement, the MSRB rules concerning broker-dealers (e.g., FINRA
                       member firms) are specifically enforced by FINRA with SEC oversight. Much of the
                       municipal securities business is done by dealer banks. These are commercial banks that are
                       not members of FINRA or any exchange. For those market participants, enforcement is in the
                       hands of various banking agencies. Those include
                        the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,
                        the Federal Reserve Board, and
                        the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).
                       It is unlikely that you will have to know which banks are supervised by which banking agency.


                       Recordkeeping for Municipal Securities Firms
                       Records of Associated Persons (Rule G-7)
                       A municipal securities dealer must obtain and keep on file specific information about its
                       associated persons. The MSRB defines an associated person as anyone with a securities
                       registration. That would include representatives and principals, but not clerical help. Most
                       of the required information (e.g., employment history, disciplinary actions, residence,
                       and personal data) is contained on the U4 and U5 forms. Any material change must be
                       updated within 30 days. These records must be kept for a minimum of three years after the
                       termination of the associated person.


                       Books and Recordkeeping Requirements (Rules G-8 ad G-9)
                       Rule G-8 lists the various records to be made and Rule G-9 states the retention requirements.
                       We think it is easier for you to learn them if we group the rules together.

                       Record maintenance requirements specify the length of time that various records must be
                       kept. Generally, records are categorized into the following three maintenance periods:
                        Records kept for the lifetime of the firm
                        Records kept for six years
                        Records kept for four years (all those not specifically designated as lifetime or six-year
                         records)

                                        A firm must keep the following records for its lifetime:
                                         Articles of incorporation (if the broker-dealer is a corporation) or partnership agreement
                                          (if the broker-dealer is a partnership)
                                         Minutes of board or partnership meetings
                                         Records of stock certificates (if the broker-dealer is a corporation)


                                        Six-Year Records
                                        A firm must keep the following records for at least six years:
                                         Blotters (records of original entry)
                                         General ledger (accounting information such as income and expense and assets and
                                          liabilities)
                                         Customer ledgers (statements of the customer’s accounts)
                                         Customer account records (six years after the account is closed)
                                         Customer complaints (only written complaints are considered and email is written)
                                         Principal designation record (which individual supervises what)

                                                  TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                  MSRB rules list customer complaints as a six-year record. FINRA rules only require a
                                                  four-year period (Lesson 15.3). This difference is likely to be tested.

                                                  TAKE NOTE
                                                  MSRB Rule G-9 requires that designations of principals must be maintained for six
                                                  years. All records must be kept readily available for two years.

                                                  EXAMPLE
                                                  A municipal securities principal who is appointed by a committee to manage the
                                                  money for an LGIP must keep the documents appointing him to this role for six years.


                                        MSRB Rule G-15
                                        This rule requires members to provide customer with written confirmation of transactions.
                                        More of the details will be covered in Lesson 15.1. One part worth mentioning here deals
                                        with computing the yield and dollar price. We know that calling a premium bond invariably
                                        results in a lower yield to the investor than holding the bond to maturity. Therefore, this rule
                                        states that in computing yield and dollar price,
                                         the yield or dollar price computed and shown shall be computed to the lower of call or
                                          nominal maturity date; and
                                         for purposes of computing yield to call or dollar price to call, only those “in whole calls”
                                          are included.

                       This is probably the shortest—yet one of the most important—of the MSRB rules. Here it is
                       in its entirety:

                                                                                                                                      Unit 6
                            In the conduct of its municipal securities or municipal advisory activities, each
                            broker-dealer and municipal advisor shall deal fairly with all persons and shall not
                            engage in any deceptive, dishonest, or unfair practice.

                       This is basically saying, “Don’t cheat, don’t steal, and don’t lie.” When you are reading an exam
                       question, always keep this in mind to help you arrive at the correct answer. And, of course,
                       once you pass, it will help you stay out of trouble.

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 16. A customer of a municipal securities firm calls her registered representative to
                                     complain about the amount of commission charged on her most recent trade. The
                                     customer is irate and demands to speak with the rep’s supervisor. The customer
                                     continues her tirade with the supervisor and threatens to sue if something isn’t done
                                     about the charge. Under MSRB rules, a record of this complaint
                                      A. must be kept for four years.
                                      B. must be kept for six years.
                                      C. must be kept for the lifetime of the firm.
                                      D. need not be kept.
                                      Answer: D. Recordkeeping requirements only apply to written complaints. It can be
                                      delivered using “snail” mail or email. In this case, the complaint was only in oral form
                                      so there is no requirement to keep a record of it. That is the “test” world. You can be
                                      sure in the “real” world, your firm would make a record, but, the real world is for after
                                      you pass the exam.


                       MSRB Rule G-21 Advertising
                       Any material designed for use in the public media is considered advertising. This includes
                       abstracts and summaries of the OS; offering circulars; reports; market letters; and form letters,
                       including professional, product, and new issue advertisements.

                       A municipal securities principal or general securities principal of the dealer must approve all
                       advertising before use, and a copy of each advertisement must be kept on file for four years.
                       We will have more to say about this in Unit 19.


                       MSRB Rule G-22 Control Relationships
                       Disclosure of Control
                       A municipal securities firm that has a control relationship with respect to a municipal security
                       is subject to additional disclosure requirements. A control relationship exists if the dealer
                       controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with that security’s issuer.

                                 EXAMPLE
                                 An officer of a municipal dealer sits on the board of directors (BOD) of an issuer.

           164         Unit 6   Municipal Bonds



                                        The dealer must disclose the control relationship to the customer before it can affect any
                                        transaction in that security for that customer. Although, initially, this disclosure can be oral,
                                        the dealer must make a written disclosure at or before the transaction’s completion. The
                                        disclosure is made on the confirmation. If the transaction is for a discretionary account, the
                                        customer must give express permission before the transaction can be executed.


                                        Rule G-37 Political Contributions
                                        Rule G-37 prohibits municipal firms from engaging in municipal securities business with an
                                        issuer for two years after any political contribution is made to an official of that issuer. In this
                                        context, municipal securities business refers to negotiated underwritings, not to competitive
                                        underwritings. The idea is to prevent firms from making large political contributions in return
                                        for being selected as underwriter for that issuer.

                                        The rule applies to contributions by the firm, its MFPs, and by political action committees
                                        controlled by the firm or its representatives. De minimis contributions of up to $250 per
                                        election are permitted by MFPs, as long as these individuals are eligible to vote for the issuer
                                        official. This exemption does not apply to firms.


                                        Municipal Financial Professional (MFP)
                                        In Rule G-37, we discussed MFPs. Who are these folks? As defined by the MSRB, a municipal
                                        finance professional (MFP) is an associated person of a broker-dealer who is primarily engaged
                                        in municipal securities activities other than retail sales to individuals. The MFP designation
                                        also includes anyone who solicits municipal securities business for the broker-dealer, or is
                                        in the supervisory chain above another person with the MFP designation. This can include
                                        senior officials of the broker-dealer, or executives, or management committee members of the
                                        broker-dealer.

                                        Of note, the MSRB is clear that anyone designated as an MFP is subject to the rules regarding
                                        political contributions and required to report those contributions to the MSRB, as well as any
                                        other payments made to a state or local political party. Be sure you know the exceptions for de
                                        minimis contributions.


                                        The Broker-Dealer as Financial Advisor
                                        Financial Advisors
                                        The MSRB has established ethical standards and disclosure requirements for municipal
                                        securities dealers that act as financial advisors to municipal securities’ issuers. A financial
                                        advisory relationship exists when a municipal dealer provides financial advisory or consulting
                                        services to an issuer with respect to a new issue for a fee or other compensation. This includes
                                        advice regarding the structure, timing, and terms of, as well as other matters concerning,
                                        the issue or issuer. Bringing a new issue public, whether it is equity or debt, is called
                                        underwriting. In Unit 20, we go into a detailed discussion of the underwriting process. In the
                                        case of municipal bonds, the disclosure document used is an official statement rather than a
                                        prospectus.

                       Basis of Compensation
                       Each financial advisory relationship must be documented in writing before, upon, or
                       promptly after its inception. This document establishes the basis of compensation for the
                       advisory services to be rendered.
                                                                                                                                  Unit 6
                       Conflicts of Interest
                       Potential conflicts of interest arise if a firm acts as both a member of the underwriting
                       syndicate and financial advisor for the same issue. The MSRB has the following requirements.

                       The MSRB simply prohibits a broker-dealer who serves as a financial advisor to a municipal
                       issuer for any issue sold on either a negotiated or competitive bid basis from switching roles
                       and underwriting the same issue. In other words, if a broker-dealer is acting as a financial
                       advisor to the issuer, generally, the broker-dealer may not participate in underwriting the
                       bonds of the issuing municipality.

                       However, there are some allowable exceptions. For example, a broker-dealer who has a
                       financial advisory relationship with an issuer regarding the issuance of municipal securities,
                       will still be permitted to assist with preparing the official statement and other similar duties
                       normally associated with underwriting. The broker-dealer can also purchase the bonds from
                       an underwriter either for its own trading account or for the accounts of its customers. But
                       in all cases, if performing such functions or acting in such a capacity as described above, the
                       broker-dealer may not receive any compensation other than for financial advisory services to
                       the issuer. In other words, no underwriting compensation can be received by the broker-dealer
                       who is acting in an advisory capacity.

                       Customers who are purchasing new securities from a broker-dealer who is acting in an
                       advisory capacity to a municipality must be informed that the advisory relationship exists at
                       or before confirmation of the sale.


                       Assistance With the Official Statement (OS)
                       As part of its financial advisory services to an issuer, a municipal securities dealer may help
                       prepare the final official statement for a new issue. If it prepares the OS, the advisor must
                       make a copy of that statement available to the managing underwriter promptly after the
                       award is made and at least two days before the syndicate manager delivers the securities to the
                       syndicate members.


                       Use of Ownership Information
                       While acting in a fiduciary capacity for an issuer, a municipal securities dealer often obtains
                       confidential information about its bondholders. The dealer cannot use this information to
                       solicit purchases or sales of municipal securities or to pursue other financial gain without the
                       issuer’s consent.

                       Examples of fiduciary capacities include, but are not limited to, acting as paying agent,
                       transfer agent, registrar, or indenture trustee for an issuer.

              INTRODUCTION
                         The U.S. Treasury issues many securities. They range from short-term money market
                         instruments to long-term bonds.

                         The U.S. Treasury Department determines the quantity and types of government securities it
                         must issue to meet federal budget needs. The marketplace determines the interest rates those
                         securities will pay. In general, the interest that government securities pay is exempt from state
                         and municipal taxation but subject to federal taxation.

                         The federal government is the nation’s largest borrower, as well as the best credit risk. Interest
                         and principal on securities issued by the U.S. government are backed by its full faith and credit,
                         which is based on its power to tax. These securities are considered the sovereign debt of the
                         United States.

                         At least for exam purposes, there is no default risk to speak of with Treasury securities, but that
                         does not mean investors can’t lose money. Government securities trade in the secondary market
                         (OTC) and are subject to interest rate risk just like other debt securities.

                         Since 1986, Treasury securities have only been available in book-entry form. Book-entry means
                         that the record of ownership is kept on the “books” of the Treasury. Before the change, you
                         would receive a beautiful certificate with engraving similar to U.S. currency.

           LESSON 7.1: TYPES OF TREASURY SECURITIES AND THEIR PRICING
                                         LO 7.a Recall the different types of securities issued by the U.S. Treasury.



                                         Treasury Bills (T-Bills)
                                         Treasury Bills (T-bills) are short-term obligations issued at a discount from par. Rather than
                                         making regular cash interest payments, bills trade at a discount from par value. The return on
                                         a T-bill is the difference between the price the investor pays and the par value at which the
                                         bill matures. Treasury bills are considered money market instruments. As mentioned earlier
                                         in the course, the 13-week T-bill is commonly used in quantitative analysis as the risk-free
                                         investment.


                                         Treasury Notes (T-Notes)
                                         Unlike Treasury bills, Treasury notes (T-notes) pay interest every six months. They are sold at
                                         auction every four weeks. They are considered intermediate length securities with maturities

                                         Treasury Bonds (T-Bonds)
                                         Treasury Bonds (T-bonds) are long-term securities (10–30 years in original maturity) that
                                         pay interest every six months. Historically, the 30-year bonds were callable at par, five years
                                         before the maturity date. Callable bonds have not been issued since 1985 and none are still
                                         available in the marketplace. It is possible that the Treasury could again begin issuing callable
                                         bonds, but most industry pundits doubt this will happen.


                                         Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities
                                         (STRIPS)
                                         In 1984, the Treasury Department entered the zero coupon bond market by designating
                                         certain Treasury issues as suitable for stripping into interest and principal components.

                                         These securities, named separate trading of registered interest and principal of securities
                                         became known by their acronym, STRIPS. Although the securities underlying Treasury
                                         STRIPS are the U.S. government’s direct obligation, major banks and dealers perform the
                                         actual separation and trading. As zero coupon bonds, they have minimal reinvestment risk.


                                         Treasury Receipts
                                         Treasury receipts are not issued by the U.S Treasury. Brokerage firms can create a type of
                                         zero coupon bond known as Treasury receipts from U.S. Treasury notes and bonds. Broker-
                                         dealers buy Treasury securities, place them in trust at a bank, and sell separate receipts against
                                         the principal and coupon payments. The Treasury securities held in trust collateralize the
                                         Treasury receipts. Unlike Treasury securities, Treasury receipts are not backed by the full faith
                                         and credit of the U.S. government. Each Treasury receipt is priced at a discount from the
                                         payment amount, like a zero coupon bond.

                                TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                STRIPS are backed in full by the U.S. government. Receipts are not. Treasury receipts
                                are created by broker-dealers and sold under names like Certificates of Accrual on
                                Treasury Securities (CATS) and Treasury Income Growth Receipts (TIGRS). Both are
                                quoted in yield to maturity and have not been issued since the late 1980s.


                      Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)
                      A type of Treasury issue, known as Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), helps
                      protect investors against purchasing power (inflation) risk. These bonds are issued with a fixed
                      interest rate, but the principal amount is adjusted semiannually by an amount equal to the
                      change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the standard measurement of inflation.

                      The interest payment the investor receives every six months is equal to the fixed interest rate
                      times the newly adjusted principal. In times of inflation, the interest payments increase, while
                      in times of deflation, the interest payments fall. These notes are sold at lower interest rates            Unit 7
                      than conventional fixed-rate Treasury notes because of their adjustable nature.

                      Like other Treasury securities, TIPS are exempt from state and local income taxes on the
                      interest income generated, but they are subject to federal taxation. However, in any year when
                      the principal is adjusted for inflation, that increase is considered reportable income for that
                      year even though the increase will not be received until the note matures. This is the same
                      phantom income we mentioned with zero coupon bonds.

                                PRACTICE QUESTION
                                1.   A risk averse client wishes the safety of a U.S treasury backed security but is
                                     concerned about the effects of inflation on the value of the dollar. Which of the
                                     following would be most appropriate for this investor?
                                       A. Treasury bills
                                       B. Treasury notes
                                       C. Treasury bonds
                                      D. TIPS
                                     Answer: D. The IP in TIPS stands for inflation protected. These are the only Treasury
                                     securities where the value at maturity can be higher than the original investment if
                                     there is inflation. It would be a disadvantage to own TIPS bonds during a period of
                                     deflation.

                      Treasury bills are issued in denominations of $100 to $5 million, and have original maturities
                      of 52 weeks or less. The 52-week bills are auctioned every four weeks, and the others, such as
                      the 4-week and 26-week bills, weekly.

                                TAKE NOTE
                                Maximum T-bill maturities are subject to change, but are never longer than 52 weeks.

                                         Pricing for T-Bills
                                         T-bills are quoted on a yield basis and sold at a discount from par. They are zero coupon
                                         securities.

                                                     EXAMPLE

                                                     The bid reflects the yield buyers want to receive. The ask reflects the yield sellers are
                                                     willing to accept.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     The exam will not require you to calculate the bid and ask prices of T-bills. However, it
                                                     is important to be able to identify the quote as a T-bill quote.
                                                     Because T-bills are quoted in yield, a T-bill quote has a bid higher than its ask price,
                                                     which is the reverse of bid-ask relationships for other instruments. Higher yield on
                                                     the bid side translates into a lower dollar price. Or you could think in terms of going
                                                     shopping; the bigger the discount, the lower the price.

                                         Maturities and Denominations
                                         Treasury notes are issued in denominations of $100 to $5 million. T-notes mature at par,
                                         or they can be refunded. If a T-note is refunded, the government offers the investor a new
                                         security with a new interest rate and maturity date as an alternative to a cash payment for the
                                         maturing note.


                                         Pricing for T-Notes
                                         T-notes are issued, quoted, and traded as a percentage of par in 1/32%.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     A quote of 98.24, which can also be expressed as 98-24 or 98:24, on a $1,000 note
                                                     means that the note is selling for 98 24⁄32% of its $1,000 par value. In this instance, 0.24
                                                     designates 24/32 of 1%, not a decimal. A quote of 98.24 equals 98.75% of $1,000, or
                                                     $987.50.

                                        paying

                                        Answer: D. A quote of 101.20 on a Treasury note means 10120⁄32. That is equal to
                                        1015⁄8. The math is

                                           101 = $1,010.

                                           5/8 = 5 × $1.25 = $6.25

                                           Total is $1,010 + $6.25 = $1,016.25

                                        Other agency-like organizations operated by private corporations include the following:
                                         Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC or Freddie Mac)
                                         Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA or Fannie Mae)
                                         Student Loan Marketing Association (SLMA or Sallie Mae)
                                        The term agency is sometimes used to refer to entities that are not technically government
                                        agencies but do have ties to the government. For example, Fannie Mae is privately owned but
                                        government sponsored.


                                        Ginnie Mae
                                        The Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) is a government-owned
                                        corporation that supports the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Ginnie Maes
                                        are the only agency securities backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government.


                                        Types of GNMA Issues
                                        Ginnie Mae does not originate mortgage loans, nor does it purchase, sell, or issue securities.
                                        Instead, private lending institutions approved by GNMA originate eligible loans and pool
                                        them into securities, known as pass-through certificates, and sell the GNMA mortgage-backed
                                        securities (MBS) to investors. These lending institutions can include mortgage companies,
                                        commercial banks, and thrift institutions of all sizes, as well as state housing finance agencies.
                                        Ginnie Mae guarantees only MBS backed by single and multifamily home loans insured by
                                        government agencies, primarily the Federal Housing Association (FHA) and the Department
                                        of Veteran Affairs (VA), as well as others. Like the principal on a single mortgage, the
                                        principal represented by a GNMA certificate constantly decreases as the mortgages are paid
                                        down. In addition, they are quoted in 32nds like T-notes and bonds.

                                        GNMA guarantees timely payment of interest and principal. GNMAs are backed directly by
                                        the government, so risk of default is nearly zero. GNMAs offer slightly higher interest rates
                                        than comparable Treasury securities. But, because they are government guaranteed, their rates
                                        are lower than other agency securities.

                                        Prices, yields, and maturities fluctuate in line with general interest-rate trends. If interest rates
                                        fall, homeowners tend to pay off their mortgages early. That has the effect of accelerating the
                                        certificates’ maturities. If interest rates rise, certificates may mature more slowly.

                                        In addition to interest rate risk (the risk that rates rise, causing the value of the underlying
                                        mortgages to fall), there are two other types of risk associated with MBS.

                                        The first is prepayment risk, the risk that the underlying mortgages will be paid off earlier
                                        than anticipated. This will occur if interest rates fall, causing homeowners to refinance their
                                        mortgages at lower rates.

                                        The second is extended maturity risk, the risk that the underlying mortgages will remain
                                        outstanding longer than anticipated. This will occur if interest rates rise, virtually eliminating
                                        any refinancings. This is also called extension risk.

                                TAKE NOTE
                                GNMAs are backed in full by the U.S. government. Other agency instruments discussed
                                next are not; they are backed by their own issuing authority. You should know the
                                following GNMA features:
                                    $1,000 minimums and in $1 increments after that
                                    Monthly interest and principal payments
                                    Taxed at all levels
                                    Pass-through certificates
                                    Significant reinvestment risk

                                TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                The exam expects you to know that MBS are susceptible to reinvestment risk. The

                                                                                                                                  Unit 7
                                reasons are outlined here.
                                When interest rates fall, mortgage holders typically refinance at lower rates. This
                                means that they pay off their mortgages early, which causes a prepayment of principal
                                to holders of MBS. The early principal payments cannot be reinvested at a comparable
                                return.
                                Sometimes the test asks which instruments are not subject to reinvestment risk.
                                Of the answer choices given, the best answer is typically a zero coupon bond. No
                                interest is paid on a current basis, so the investor has no reinvestment risk.


                      Farm Credit System (FCS)
                      The Farm Credit System (FCS) is a national network of lending institutions that provides
                      agricultural financing and credit. The system is a privately owned, government-sponsored
                      enterprise that raises loanable funds through the sale of Farm Credit securities to investors.
                      They are not obligations of, nor are they guaranteed, by the U.S. government or any federal
                      agency. They are backed by the Banks of the FCS.
                      These funds are made available to farmers through a nationwide network of four banks and
                      68 Farm Credit lending institutions. The Farm Credit Administration (FCA), a government
                      agency, oversees the system. Included in the system are the Federal Land Banks, Federal
                      Intermediate Credit Banks, and Banks for Cooperatives.

                      The federal FCS issues discount notes, floating rate bonds, and fixed rate bonds. The
                      maturities range from one day to 30 years. The proceeds from the sale of securities are used to
                      provide farmers with real estate loans, rural home mortgage loans, and crop insurance.


                      Freddie Mac
                      The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (FHLMC) is a public corporation. It
                      was created to promote the development of a nationwide secondary market in mortgages by
                      buying residential mortgages from financial institutions and packaging them into MBS for
                      sale to investors.

                      FHLMC sells two types of securities: mortgage participation certificates (PCs) and
                      guaranteed mortgage certificates (GMCs). PCs make principal and interest payments once a
                      month; GMCs make interest payments twice a year and principal payments once a year.

                                         Fannie Mae
                                         The Federal National Mortgage Association (FNMA) is a publicly held corporation that
                                         provides mortgage capital. FNMA purchases conventional and insured mortgages from
                                         agencies such as the FHA and the VA. The securities it creates are backed by FNMA’s general
                                         credit.


                                         Types of FNMA Issues
                                         FNMA issues debentures, short-term discount notes, and MBS. In the case of virtually all of
                                         the agencies, there are no certificates delivered. Records of ownership are kept electronically.
                                         As mentioned earlier, this is referred to as being issued in book-entry form.


                                         Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae or SLMA)
                                         Sallie Mae issues short-term and long-term securities. The proceeds from the securities sales
                                         are used to provide student loans for higher education.

                                         Sallie Mae was once an agency issue of the U.S. government but is now privately owned with
                                         its common stock (symbol SLM) trading on Nasdaq. It might still be improperly grouped
                                         with agency issues on a test question.


                                         Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)
                                         One final agency that might be tested is the TVA. The Tennessee Valley Authority is the
                                         nation’s largest public power provider and a corporation of the U.S. government. TVA bonds
                                         are not backed by the U.S. government. Instead, they are backed by the revenues generated
                                         by the agencies’ projects. However, credit-rating agencies perceive that there is an “implicit
                                         government guarantee of TVA bonds.” If push came to shove, it’s a good bet that Uncle Sam
                                         would make that guarantee explicit. One special characteristic of TVA bonds is that they are
                                         frequently issued with maturities of 50 years.

                                         Pass-Through Certificates
                                         A pass-through security is created by pooling a group of mortgages and selling certificates
                                         representing interests in the pool. The term pass-through refers to the mechanism of passing
                                         homebuyers’ interest and principal payments from the mortgage holder to the investors.
                                         Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae, and Freddie Mac function this way. In some cases, such as the
                                         GNMA, the payments are monthly.


                                         Denominations of Agency Securities
                                         FINRA states that most agency bonds are sold in a variety of increments. The minimum is
                                         generally $10,000, with increments of $5,000. We have listed the details as supplied by the
                                         various agencies and they don’t always agree with FINRA’s statement. Because of the wide
                                         variety, we don’t imagine this will be highly tested on the exam, even though it is included in
                                         the Content Outline. Should we learn anything specific, it will be posted to Exam Tips.

                       GNMA
                       GNMA MBS are issued in minimum denominations of $1,000 and multiples of $1 in excess
                       of $1,000. Because few mortgages last the full term, yield quotes are based on a 12-year
                       prepayment assumption, that is, a mortgage balance should be prepaid in full after 12 years of
                       normally scheduled payments.


                       Farm Credit System (FCS)
                       FCSs are not pass-through securities. Denominations are $1,000 with $1,000 increments.


                       FHLMC
                       Freddie Mac offers a wide variety of increments with different minimums. For example, the
                       discount notes with a maturity of one year or less are offered in denominations of $1,000,
                                                                                                                                       Unit 7
                       with $1,000 increments. FHLMC also offers reference notes with 2–10 year maturities in
                       minimum denominations of $2,000 with $1,000 increments.


                       FNMA
                       For test purposes, know that the mortgage-backed securities are available in minimum
                       denominations of $1,000 with $1 increments after that. Interest is paid semiannually.


                       SLMA
                       The long-term issues are generally in $10,000 minimum denominations.

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 3.   Which statement regarding U.S. government agency obligations is true?
                                       A. They are all direct obligations of the U.S. government.
                                       B. They generally have higher yields than yields of Treasury securities.
                                       C. The FNMA interest is taxed only at the federal level.
                                       D. Securities issued by GNMA trade on the NYSE floor.
                                      Answer: B. U.S. government agency debt is an obligation of the issuing agency, not
                                      the U.S. government. The only exception to that is the GNMA. This causes agency
                                      debt to trade at higher yields reflecting this greater risk. Interest on FNMA securities is
                                      taxed at all levels and no Treasury security trades on the NYSE.

                       Interest Income
                       The interest earned on any security issued by the U.S. Treasury is taxable on the federal
                       level. The interest on any security issued by the U.S. Treasury is exempt from state and local
                       taxation.

                                         There is one taxation oddity and that deals with TIPS bonds. As we described earlier in this
                                         Unit, each six months, there is an adjustment to the principal value based on the inflation
                                         rate as measured by the CPI. Even though the investor does not receive that increase until the
                                         bond matures, it is reported as interest income each year.


                                         Capital Gain or Loss
                                         When an investor sells a Treasury security at a price higher than the purchase price, it is
                                         considered a capital gain. The sale at a price below cost is a capital loss. These gains and losses
                                         are no different from the others we have covered thus far. We do not expect the exam to deal
                                         with accreting the discount on T-bills.


                                         Taxation of Agency Securities

                                         Interest Income
                                         The one constant about taxation of agency securities is that the interest is always subject
                                         to federal income tax. This parallels the taxation of Treasury issues. Where there are some
                                         differences is in regard to state income tax.


                                         Taxation of Mortgage-Backed Agency Securities
                                         Interest earned on GNMA, FHLMC, and FNMA certificates is taxable at the federal, state,
                                         and local levels. Remember that a portion of the payments on MBS is a return of principal.
                                         That is nontaxable.


                                         Taxation of Nonmortgaged-Backed Agency Securities
                                         Interest paid on Farm Credit System and Federal Home Loan Banks securities is taxable at the
                                         federal level and is exempt from state and local taxation in most states.


                                         Capital Gain or Loss
                                         In the case of non-MBS, gains and losses are computed the same way as any other security. In
                                         the case of MBS, because each payment includes principal, the computation for a gain or loss
                                         is likely too complex for the exam.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     Before we move on to the next unit, here is a summary of the tax treatment of interest:
                                                         Interest on corporate bonds is taxable on all levels (federal, state, and local).
                                                         Interest on municipal securities may be taxed by the municipal level (state and
                                                          local governments) but not by the federal government.
                                                         Interest on issues of the federal government (Treasury bills, notes, and bonds) is
                                                          taxed by the federal government but is exempt from taxation at the state and local
                                                          levels.

              INTRODUCTION
                         When seeing the term investment company, most investors think about mutual funds. Although
                         those represent the largest portion of the industry, there are other types that are tested. Those
                         include closed-end funds (CEFs) and exchange-traded funds (ETFs).

                         An investment company is a corporation or a trust through which investors may acquire an
                         interest in large, diversified portfolios of securities by pooling their funds with other investors’
                         funds and buying shares or units of the fund. People often invest in investment companies
                         because they believe a professional money manager should be able to outperform the average
                         investor in the market.

                                        Investment companies, especially mutual funds, offer many services that benefit investors.
                                        One of the challenges for any registered representative is matching the right fund to the
                                        customer’s objectives.

                                        Investment companies are subject to regulations regarding how their shares are sold to the
                                        public. The Investment Company Act of 1940 provides for SEC regulation of investment
                                        companies and their activities. It is that act that defines the types of investment companies.


           LESSON 8.1: DEFINITIONS UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT
                       OF 1940
                                        LO 8.a Identify the different types of investment companies.



                                        Types of Investment Companies
                                        The Investment Company Act of 1940 classifies investment companies into three broad types:
                                        face-amount certificate (FAC) companies, unit investment trusts (UITs), and management
                                        investment companies.


                                        Face-Amount Certificate (FAC) Companies
                                        A face-amount certificate (FAC) is a contract between an investor and an issuer in which
                                        the issuer guarantees payment of a stated (or fixed) sum to the investor at some set date in the
                                        future. In return for this future payment, the investor agrees to pay the issuer a set amount of
                                        money either as a lump sum or in periodic installments.

                                        The only fact you need to know about this security is that it is one of the three types of
                                        investment companies listed in the Investment Company Act of 1940.


                                        Unit Investment Trusts (UITs)
                                        The next of the entities meeting the definition of an investment company under the
                                        Investment Company Act is the UITs. A unit investment trust (UIT) is an unmanaged
                                        investment company organized under a trust indenture. UITs do not
                                         have boards of directors,
                                         employ an investment adviser, and
                                         actively manage their own portfolios (trade securities).
                                        A unit investment trust issues only redeemable securities, known as units or shares of
                                        beneficial interest, each of which represents an undivided interest in a portfolio of specified
                                        securities. Once the specified total is raised, the trustees use the investor’s money to purchase
                                        securities designed to meet the UIT’s stated objective. Without an investment adviser
                                        (management), once compiled, the portfolio remains fixed. An example of a UIT is one solely
                                        invested in municipal bonds where the trust liquidates after the final bond in the portfolio
                                        matures. There are also equity trusts where, because stock doesn’t mature, the portfolio
                                        is liquidated at a predetermined date and the proceeds are distributed to unit holders or
                                        reinvested into a new trust at the investor’s option. UITs are sold by prospectus.

                                        Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the trustees must maintain secondary markets
                                        in the units, thus allowing unit holders the ability to redeem their units at NAV. Some

                       ETFs—covered later in this unit—are organized as UITs and trade, as the name implies, on
                       exchanges or Nasdaq.

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 Know the following features of UITs:
                                     UITs are not actively managed; there is no board of directors (BOD) or investment
                                      adviser.
                                     UIT shares (units) must be redeemed by the trust.
                                     UITs are investment companies as defined under the Investment Company Act.

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 1.   Louis owns an investment that is an unmanaged portfolio in which the money
                                      manager initially selects the securities to be included in the portfolio and then
                                      holds those securities until they mature or the investment portfolio terminates. This
                                      statement best describes which type of investment?
                                        A. Closed-end investment company
                                        B. Face-amount certificate (FAC) company
                                        C. Open-end investment company
                                       D. Unit investment trust (UIT)
                                      Answer: D. A UIT is a type of investment company, which is generally unmanaged as
                                      the money manager initially selects the securities to be included in the portfolio and
                                      then holds those securities until they mature or the UIT terminates.


                       Management Companies                                                                                          Unit 8
                       The most familiar type of investment company is the management investment company,
                       which actively manages a securities portfolio to achieve a stated investment objective. A
                       management investment company is either closed-end or open-end. Mutual funds are open-
                       end investment companies. Initially, both closed-end and open-end companies sell shares to
                       the public; the difference between them lies in the way they raise capital and how investors
                       buy and sell their shares—in the primary or secondary market. Most ETFs, covered later, are
                       open-end investment companies. However, on the exam, when you see open-end investment
                       company, think mutual fund. ETFs will be identified separately.

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 Open-end and closed-end investment companies have far more similarities than
                                 differences. One of these is the term, net asset value per share, generally shown as
                                 NAV. This value is the result of the fund valuing all of its assets (the largest of which is
                                 the portfolio), subtracting its liabilities, and then dividing that by the number of shares
                                 outstanding. This NAV per share computation is critical to the purchase and sale of
                                 open-end companies, and, as we’ll see, has little relationship to the buying and selling
                                 price of CEFs.

                                 TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                 It is important for you to know that the definition of investment company does not
                                 include holding companies.

                                                   3.   An open-end investment company’s net assets are $1 billion. It has elected
                                                        to be treated as a diversified investment company. The company would be in

                                                         B. invested $300 million into ABC stock.
                                                         C. invested $350 million into ABC stock.
                                                         D. purchased 100% of the voting shares of ABC stock.
                                                        Answer: C. You must remember that the 5% and 10% limitations only apply to 75%
                                                        of the fund’s portfolio. The other 25%—in this case, $250 million—can be invested
                                                        wherever the fund’s management desires. Within the diversified 75%, the fund can
                                                        own $50 million of a single issuer’s stock (5% of the $1 billion total). Then, the other
                                                        25% can purchase $250 million, giving it a total of $300 million in one stock. That
                                                        $300 million could buy 100% of the voting shares of many publicly traded companies.
                                                        Remember, that 10% limit only applies to the diversified 75%.

              LESSON 8.2: COMPARING OPEN-END AND CLOSED-END MANAGEMENT
                          INVESTMENT COMPANIES
                         LO 8.b Compare the difference between the method of capitalization of open-end
                         investment companies and closed-end investment companies.



                         Management Companies—Methods of Capitalization
                         As we remarked earlier, there are many similarities between open-end and closed-end
                         companies. The most significant difference is in the way they raise capital from investors.


                         Open-End Investment Companies Initial Capitalization
                         An open-end investment company, or mutual fund, does not specify the exact number of
                         shares it intends to issue. It registers an open offering with the SEC. The open-end investment
                         company can raise an unlimited amount of investment capital by continuously issuing new
                         shares. As we will cover in Unit 20, because the shares are always a new issue, it is required
                         to deliver a prospectus prior to or concurrent with the sale. As a consequence, investors in
                         mutual funds are always purchasing a new issue. The money invested goes to the issuer (the
                         mutual fund). One other point is that open-end companies can only issue common stock.
                         The money raised from the issuance of that common stock is then used by the portfolio
                         manager(s) to invest in securities meeting that fund’s objectives. For example, a mutual fund
                         seeking income would likely invest a substantial portion of its capital into bonds and/or
                         preferred stock. Don’t confuse the limitation on only issuing common stock to raise capital
                         with what it can invest with that capital—bond funds will use the proceeds from the sale of               Unit 8
                         the common shares issued to buy bonds.

                                   TAKE NOTE
                                   An open-end investment company can buy preferred stock and bonds, but it cannot
                                   issue any security other than common stock.


                         Closed-End Investment Companies Initial Capitalization
                         As we stated, the primary difference between the two categories of management companies
                         (closed-end and open-end) is the way in which they raise capital and subsequently trade. To
                         raise capital, a closed-end investment company conducts a common stock offering. For the
                         initial offering, the company registers a fixed number of shares with the SEC and offers them
                         to the public for a limited time through an underwriting group in a manner the same as any
                         corporate stock offering. The fund’s capitalization is fixed unless an additional public offering
                         is made at a later time.

                         Investors cannot redeem their shares back to the company. Investors close their position by
                         selling them in the secondary market just like any publicly traded stock.

                         Having just said investors cannot redeem their shares of a closed-end fund, we need to
                         mention an exception. There is a breed of closed-end funds called interval funds. Here are the
                         key facts to know:
                          These are closed-end investment companies, registered as such under the Investment
                           Company Act of 1940.
                          Unlike other closed-end funds, interval funds do not trade in the secondary market.

                                         They are called interval funds because at certain intervals, which may be anything from
                                          monthly to annually, investors are allowed to sell a portion of their shares back to the
                                          fund at net asset value (NAV).
                                         One benefit of these funds is that the portfolio manager can take certain illiquid positions
                                          a mutual fund manager might not take because there is no need for daily liquidity with an
                                          interval fund.
                                         In general, these would be more suitable for an investor with a longer time horizon.
                                        Closed-end investment companies can also issue bonds and preferred stock. Therefore, the
                                        capital structure of a closed-end company can resemble that of any other corporation—
                                        common stock, preferred stock, and bonds.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   4.   An investor is always purchasing newly issued shares of common stock when
                                                        investing in
                                                          A. a closed-end investment company.
                                                          B. an open-end investment company (mutual fund).
                                                          C. a unit investment trust (UIT).
                                                          D. a holding company.
                                                        Answer: B. A unique characteristic of mutual funds is that they are capitalized by a
                                                        continuous offering of new shares. Whenever an investor adds to her portfolio, she is
                                                        buying new shares of common stock issued by that fund. UITs issue units, not shares,
                                                        in a one-time offering.


                                        Business Development Company (BDC)
                                        Business development companies were created by an act of Congress in 1980. The purpose
                                        was to create a new vehicle to aid in the promotion and development of small businesses. A
                                        business development company (BDC) is a closed-end investment company regulated under
                                        the Investment Company Act of 1940. It does not have the flexibility of regular closed-end
                                        funds because at least 70% of its assets must be invested “eligible” assets.

                                        The term eligible portfolio company includes any issuer that does not have any class of securities
                                        listed on a national securities exchange. There is an exception for issuers with a class of
                                        securities listed on a national securities exchange if they have an aggregate market value of
                                        outstanding voting and non-voting common equity of less than $250 million.
                                        Perhaps the most significant difference between a closed-end fund and a BDC is that, with
                                        respect to the eligible assets, the BDC must make available significant managerial assistance.
                                        In other words, in addition to being an investment company, a BDC is also an operating
                                        company.

                                        investment companies.



                                        Management Companies—Pricing Methods
                                        One of the most significant differences between open-end and CEFs is the way in which they
                                        are priced. Although both types of funds compute the NAV per share, it is only the open-end
                                        company whose price is solely dependent upon that calculation. The exam will have several

                       questions on how and why each pricing method is used. We will begin with a discussion of
                       pricing closed-end fund shares.


                       Pricing of Closed-End Investment Company Shares
                       Closed-end investment companies are commonly known as publicly traded funds. After
                       the stock is distributed, anyone can buy or sell shares in the secondary market, either on an
                       exchange or OTC. Supply and demand determine the bid price (price at which an investor
                       can sell) and the ask price (price at which an investor can buy). Closed-end fund shares
                       usually trade at a premium or discount to the shares’ NAV.

                                 TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                 Please remember the following point:
                                 Closed-end investment companies trade in the secondary market (exchange or OTC).
                                 That makes their price based upon supply and demand for their shares. As a result,
                                 their buying and selling price does not have a direct relationship to the NAV of the
                                 shares. Put another way, the market price of a closed-end fund is independent of the
                                 fund’s NAV.


                       Pricing of Open-End Investment Company Shares
                       When it comes to open-end investment companies (mutual funds), any person who wants to
                       invest in the company buys shares directly from the company or its underwriters (or a broker-
                       dealer with a selling agreement) at the public offering price (POP). A mutual fund’s POP is
                       the NAV per share plus any applicable sales charges. A mutual fund’s NAV is calculated daily               Unit 8
                       by deducting the fund’s liabilities from its total assets. NAV per share is calculated by dividing
                       the fund’s NAV by the number of shares outstanding. Because all buying and redeeming
                       is done through the investment company, there is no secondary trading of shares in these
                       companies.

                       An open-end investment company sells redeemable securities. When investors liquidate
                       their shares, the company redeems them at their NAV. For each share an investor redeems, the
                       company sends the investor money for the investor’s proportionate share of the company’s net
                       assets. Therefore, a mutual fund’s capital shrinks when investors redeem shares.

                       Each investor’s share in the fund’s performance is based on the number of shares owned.
                       Mutual fund shares may be purchased in either full or fractional units, unlike stock, which
                       may be purchased in full units only. Because mutual fund shares can be fractional, the investor
                       can think in terms of dollars rather than number of shares owned. Because CEFs trade like
                       any other corporate stock, fractional shares are not available.

                                 EXAMPLE
                                 If NavCo Mutual Fund shares have a POP of $15 per share, a $100 investment buys
                                 6.667 shares ($100 ÷ $15 = 6.667).


                       Forward Pricing
                       Open-end investment companies (mutual funds) must compute their NAV per share at least
                       once per day (very few compute more than that) as of the close of the markets (generally
                       4:00 pm ET). Price determination for purchases and sales is based upon the forward pricing
                       principle. That is, whenever an order, whether to purchase or redeem shares, is received, the

                                        price is based upon the next computed NAV per share. For example, any order received (and
                                        time stamped) before 4:00 pm ET will be executed at the price computed as of that day’s
                                        market close. If the order is received at 4:00 pm (or later), it will be executed based upon the
                                        NAV computed as of 4:00 pm the next business day.

                                        The following chart summarizes the testable differences between open-end and closed-end

                                                   We said earlier that CEFs also compute NAV; however, because their price is
                                                   determined by supply and demand and, as a consequence, may be more than, the

                                                   end funds. Therefore, instead of daily computation, it is generally only done once per
                                                   week.

                                                        remember for the exam that the price of a closed-end company is based on supply
                                                        and demand and, therefore, can sell at, above, or below the fund’s NAV.

              LESSON 8.3: MUTUAL FUND SHARE CLASSES
                         LO 8.d Contrast the different mutual fund share classes and how that relates to the
                         different types of loads charged to fund investors.



                         Introduction
                         FINRA Rule 2341 prohibits its members who underwrite fund shares from assessing sales
                         charges in excess of 8.5% of the POP on the purchase of open-end investment company shares.
                         The actual schedule of sales charges is specified in the prospectus. Sales loads, management
                         fees, and operating expenses reduce an investor’s returns because they diminish the amount of
                         money invested in a fund. Historically, mutual funds have charged front-end loads of up to
                         8.5% of the money invested (POP). Today, few, if any, charge that much.

                         Alternatively, funds may charge a back-end load when funds are withdrawn. Some funds
                         charge ongoing fees under section 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940. These
                         funds deduct annual fees to pay for marketing and distribution costs.

                                    TAKE NOTE
                                    The term used for the expense of buying or selling mutual fund shares is called sales
                                    charge or sales load. You will see us use charge and load interchangeably.


                         Costs to Purchase Mutual Funds
                         All sales commissions and expenses for an open-end fund are embedded in the POP or other                    Unit 8
                         fees. Sales expenses include commissions for the managing underwriter, broker-dealers, and
                         their registered representatives, as well as all advertising and sales literature expenses. Mutual
                         fund distributors use different methods to collect the fees for the sale of shares and one to
                         compensate sales persons on an ongoing basis (trailer commissions):
                          Front-end loads (difference between POP and NAV)—Class A shares
                          Back-end loads (contingent deferred sales loads)—primarily Class B shares
                          Level loads (asset-based fees—provide trail commissions to the registered representative
                           servicing the account)—generally Class C shares

                         Most of the exam questions will be on Class A shares, so we will start there.


                         Class A Shares
                         Shares sold with a front-end load are called Class A shares. Front-end sales loads are the
                         charges included in a fund’s POP. The charges are added to the NAV at the time an investor
                         buys shares. Front-end loads are the most common way of paying for the distribution services
                         that a fund’s underwriter and broker-dealers provide.

                                    EXAMPLE
                                    An investor deposits $10,000 with a mutual fund that has a 5% front-end load.
                                    The 5% load amounts to $500, which is deducted from the invested amount. In this
                                    example, $9,500 is invested in the fund’s portfolio on the investor’s behalf.

                                        Breakpoints
                                        The schedule of quantity purchase discounts a mutual fund offers is called the fund’s
                                        breakpoints.

                                        Breakpoints are available to any person. For a breakpoint qualification, person includes
                                        married couples, parents and their minor children, corporations, and certain other entities.
                                        Investment clubs or associations formed for the purpose of investing do not qualify for
                                        breakpoints.

                                        The following are breakpoint considerations:
                                         Breakpoint levels vary across mutual fund families. There is no industry standardized
                                          breakpoint schedule.
                                         Mutual funds that offer breakpoints must disclose their breakpoint schedule in the
                                          prospectus and how an account is valued for breakpoint purposes.
                                         The SEC further encourages that breakpoint discount availability information be
                                          accessible through various means of communication, including websites.
                                         Discounts may be the result of a single large investment, a series of aggregated
                                          investments, or a promise to invest via a letter of intent (LOI).
                                         Purchases made by the same investor in various accounts can be aggregated to qualify
                                          for a breakpoint discount. Eligible accounts include traditional brokerage, accounts held
                                          directly with a fund company, 401(k), IRA, and 529 college savings.
                                         Shares purchased in the same fund family other than money market accounts are eligible
                                          to be aggregated together to qualify for a breakpoint discount, including those held at
                                          separate securities firms.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    You can expect a question on who is eligible for breakpoints. Married couples, parents
                                                    with minor children, and corporations are eligible. Parents combined with adult
                                                    children (even if they are legally considered dependents) and investment clubs are not
                                                    eligible.
                                        The discounts of sales charges are spelled out in a mutual fund’s prospectus, but the following
                                        table illustrates a typical example.

                      Breakpoint Sale
                      FINRA prohibits registered representatives from making or seeking higher commissions by
                      selling investment company shares in a dollar amount just below the point at which the sales
                      charge is reduced. This violation is known as a breakpoint sale, and is considered contrary
                      to just and equitable principles of trade. It is the responsibility of all parties concerned,
                      particularly the principal, to prevent deceptive practices.

                                TAKE NOTE
                                Breakpoints offer a significant advantage to mutual fund purchasers; however,
                                breakpoint sales are prohibited.


                      Letter of Intent (LOI)
                      A person who plans to invest more money with the same mutual fund company may
                      immediately decrease his overall sales charges by signing a letter of intent (LOI). In the
                      LOI, the investor informs the investment company that he intends to invest the additional
                      funds necessary to reach the breakpoint within 13 months. By entering into the LOI,
                      every purchase, beginning with the first, is made with the sales charge appropriate to the
                      breakpoint.

                      The LOI is a one-sided contract binding on the fund only. However, the customer must
                      complete the investment to qualify for the reduced sales charge. The fund holds some of the
                      shares purchased in escrow. If the customer invests enough of the money to complete the LOI,
                      he receives the escrowed shares. If not, he is given the choice to either pay the sales charge
                      difference or have the underwriter liquidate enough of the escrowed shares to do so.
                                                                                                                                Unit 8
                                EXAMPLE
                                Refer back to the sample breakpoint schedule. A customer investing $18,000 is just
                                short of the $25,000 breakpoint. In this situation, the customer might sign a LOI
                                promising an amount that will qualify for the breakpoint within 13 months from
                                the date of the letter. Investing an additional $7,000 within 13 months qualifies the
                                customer for the reduced sales charge. The customer is charged the appropriate
                                reduced sales charge at the time of the initial purchase.
                                A customer who has not completed the investment within 13 months will be given the
                                choice of sending a check for the difference in sales charges or cashing in escrowed
                                shares to pay the difference.


                      Backdating the Letter
                      A fund often permits a customer to sign a LOI as late as the 90th day after an initial purchase.
                      The LOI may be backdated by up to 90 days to include prior purchases but may not cover
                      more than 13 months in total. A customer who signs the LOI 60 days after a purchase has 11
                      months to complete the letter.

                                                   on this breakpoint schedule. The LOI allows for a discount on an installment plan
                                                   purchase.

                                        Rights of Accumulation
                                        Rights of accumulation, like an LOI, allow an investor to qualify for reduced sales charges by
                                        reaching a breakpoint. The major differences are that rights of accumulation
                                         allow the investor to use prior share appreciation and reinvestment to qualify for
                                          breakpoints and
                                         do not impose time limits.
                                        The customer may qualify for reduced charges when the total value of shares previously
                                        purchased plus the new purchase exceeds a breakpoint amount. For the purpose of qualifying
                                        customers for rights of accumulation, the mutual fund generally bases the quantity of
                                        securities owned on the higher of current NAV or the total of purchases made to date.

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 Assume the following breakpoint schedule:

                                  Purchase Amount         Sales Charge
                                  $0–$24,999                  6.5%
                                  $25,000–$49,999             5.5%
                                  $50,000–$99,999              5%
                                  $100,000–$249,999            3%
                                  $250,000–$499,999            2%
                                  $500,000–$999,999            1%
                                  $1,000,000 +                 0%
                                 An investor deposits $5,000 (paying a 6.5% sales charge) in a mutual fund but does not
                                 sign an LOI. The $5,000 grows to $10,000 over time and the investor decides to invest
                                 another $15,000. If rights of accumulation exist, the new $15,000 pays a 5.5% sales
                                 charge, which is based on the new money plus the accumulated value in the account
                                 ($15,000 + $10,000 = $25,000). If rights of accumulation do not exist, the sales charge
                                 would have been 6.5%.


                       Combination Privilege
                       A mutual fund company frequently offers more than one fund and refers to these multiple
                       offerings as its family of funds. An investor seeking a reduced sales charge may be allowed
                       to combine separate investments in two or more funds within the same family to reach a

                                                                                                                                  Unit 8

                       Computing the Sales Charge Percentage
                       When the NAV and the POP are known, the sales charge percentage can be determined.

                            POP ($10.50) – NAV ($10) = sales charge dollar amount ($0.50)

                            sales charge dollar amount ($0.50)
                                                               = sales charge percentage (4.8%)
                                       POP ($10.50)
                       If the dollar amounts for the NAV and sales charges are specified, the formula for determining
                       the POP of mutual fund shares is NAV ($10) + sales charge dollar amount ($0.50) = POP
                       dollar amount ($10.50).

                       A mutual fund prospectus must contain a formula that explains how the fund computes the
                       NAV and how the sales charge is added. The sales charge is always based on the POP, not on
                       the NAV.

                       If the dollar amount of the NAV and the sales charge percentage are specified, the formula to
                       determine POP is to divide the NAV by 100% minus the sales charge percentage.

                                         NAV ($10)
                                                                  = POP ($10.50)
                            100% – sales charge percentage (4.8%)
                       Because of the sales charge, loaded funds should be recommended for long-term investing.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   1.   NAV = $20 and POP = $21. What is the sales charge percentage?
                                                        The sales charge percentage is calculated by finding the sales charge amount ($21
                                                        – $20) and dividing by the POP. Remember, sales charge is a percentage of the
                                                        POP, not the NAV:
                                                           $1 ÷ $21 = 4.8% (when rounded)
                                                   2.   Assume a NAV of $20 and a sales charge of 5%. What is the POP?
                                                        POP is found by dividing the NAV by 100% minus the sales charge percentage:
                                                           $20 ÷ 0.95 = $21.05
                                                        In determining the POP when provided with the NAV, the answer has to be more
                                                        than the NAV. If such a question has only one choice with a higher POP than the
                                                        NAV, the correct answer should be immediately apparent.


                                        Class B Shares
                                        Class B shares do not charge a front-end sales charge, but they do impose a back-end charge
                                        for early redemption of shares. In addition, there is an asset-based 12b-1 fee (covered shortly)
                                        greater than those imposed on Class A shares.

                                        The distinguishing feature of Class B shares is that they impose a contingent deferred sales
                                        charge (CDSC), also called a back-end load. The CDSC normally declines and eventually is
                                        eliminated over time. Once the CDSC is eliminated, almost all Class B shares convert into
                                        Class A shares. When they convert, they will be charged the same (lower) asset-based 12b-1
                                        fee as the Class A shares.

                                        Class B shares do not impose a sales charge at the time of purchase, so unlike Class A share
                                        purchases, 100 cents of the invested dollar are invested.

                                        The following table contains a typical CDSC schedule for Class B shares.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   Although not specifically listed as a violation, regulators scrutinize large purchases of
                                                   Class B shares. A purchase large enough to reach a significant Class A share breakpoint
                                                   results in a low enough sales charge that, in just a few years, the lower operating
                                                   expenses of the Class A shares will more than make up the difference in front-end cost.
                                                   In practice, very few firms will accept an order for Class B shares in excess of $100,000,
                                                   particularly if the investor intends to maintain the position for a number of years.

                       Class C Shares (Level Load)
                       Class C shares typically have a one-year 1% CDSC, a 0.75% 12b-1 fee (discussed shortly),
                       and a 0.25% shareholder services fee. Because these fees are relatively high and never go
                       away, C shares are commonly referred to as having a level load. Class C shares are appropriate
                       for investors who have short time horizons because they become quite expensive to own if
                       investing for more than four years.

                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                  6.   When discussing investment companies, the term sales load most commonly refers
                                       to
                                         A. the fund’s sales charge, expressed as a percentage of the NAV.
                                        B. the fund’s sales charge, expressed as a percentage of the public offering price
                                            (POP).
                                        C. the commission earned by the broker-dealer making the sale.
                                        D. the 12b-1 fee.
                                       Answer: B. Class A shares of an open-end investment company, (mutual fund) have
                                       a front-end sales charge, or sales load, which is computed as a percentage of the POP.
                                       That is, if the fund’s POP is $10 and the NAV is $9.50, the 50-cent sales charge is 5% of
                                       the $10 offering price. In general, most of the sales load is paid to the broker-dealer
                                       making the sale as compensation. The 12b-1 fee is never referred to as a sales load
                                       because it is not related to the sale of shares.


                       12b-1 Asset-Based Fees
                                                                                                                                      Unit 8
                       As an asset-based fee, 12b-1 fees are often called asset-based distribution fees. Named after
                       the SEC rule that allows them, 12b-1 fees are used to cover the costs of marketing and
                       distributing the fund to investors. These 12b-1 fees are also used to compensate registered
                       representatives for servicing an account (trailer commissions) but shouldn’t be confused with
                       sales charges. The fee is deducted quarterly as a percentage of the fund’s average total NAV.

                       The maximum 12b-1 fee is 0.75% for distribution and promotion. FINRA does permit funds
                       to charge an additional 0.25% as a service fee. That makes the total 1.0%, only 0.75% of
                       which is the 12b-1 fee.

                       The fee must reflect the anticipated level of distribution services.


                       No-Load Funds
                       As the name implies, this means that the fund does not charge any type of sales load. No-
                       loads may charge fees that are not sales loads. For example, a no-load fund is permitted to
                       charge redemption fees. Although a redemption fee is deducted from redemption proceeds
                       just like a deferred sales load, it is not considered to be a sales load. Those are usually charged
                       when an investor is going in and out of the fund too frequently. In addition, under FINRA
                       rules, a fund is permitted to pay its annual operating expenses and still call itself no-load.
                       However, the combined amount of the fund’s 12b-1 fees or separate shareholder service fees
                       cannot exceed 0.25% of the fund’s average annual net assets.


                       Misuse of No-Load Terminology
                       A fund that has a deferred sales charge or an asset-based 12b-1 fee of more than 0.25% of
                       average net assets may not be described as a no-load fund, nor can the fund have any front-

                                        end load. To do so violates the conduct rules. The violation is not alleviated by disclosures in
                                        the fund’s prospectus.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   Expect questions about 12b-1 fees and know the following points:
                                                       The 12b-1 fee is expressed as an annual amount but is charged and reviewed
                                                        quarterly.
                                                       Charges covered by 12b-1 fees include advertising, sales literature, and
                                                        prospectuses delivered to potential customers, not fund-management expenses.
                                                       In order for a fund to market itself to the public as a no-load fund, the fund may
                                                        not charge more than 0.25% of average net assets for 12b-1 fees.
                                                       The maximum allowable 12b-1 charge under FINRA rules is 0.75% (75 basis
                                                        points).
                                                       FINRA does permit an additional 0.25% charge for shareholder services (25
                                                        basis points), but that is treated separate from the 12b-1 fee for marketing and
                                                        promotion.


                                        Expense Ratio
                                        All mutual funds have expenses. It is important that you understand these expenses are not
                                        considered a cost of purchasing the fund. A fund’s expense ratio expresses the management
                                        fees and operating expenses as a percentage of the fund’s net assets. All mutual funds, load and
                                        no-load, have expense ratios.

                                        The expense ratio is calculated by dividing annual operating expenses by the average dollar
                                        value of the fund’s assets under management.

                                        The sales charge is not considered an expense when calculating a fund’s expense ratio.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   An expense ratio of 1.72% means that the fund spends $1.72 per year for every $100
                                                   of invested assets. Typically, more aggressive funds have higher expense ratios. An
                                                   aggressive growth fund’s expense ratio is usually higher than that of a AAA bond
                                                   fund because more trading occurs in the growth fund’s portfolio. That increases the
                                                   commission expense and, because the portfolio manager is generally making more
                                                   decisions, the management fee tends to be higher.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   7.   Barbara wishes to invest in the KAPCO Growth Fund, an open-end investment
                                                        company. She expects to hold the shares for at least 10 years. If she purchases
                                                        KAPCO’s Class A shares, each of these would be a way for her to receive a reduction
                                                        on the sales charge except

                                        Answer: B. Reaching a breakpoint is the way in which investors can receive a “break”
                                        on the sales load charged when purchasing Class A shares. Purchases may be
                                        combined with spouses and dependent children, but not other family members—
                                        such as siblings—making the exception here choice B. The three ways to reach a
                                        breakpoint are:
                                            a lump-sum purchase,
                                            using a LOI granting 13 months to reach the breakpoint, or
                                            taking advantage of rights of accumulation (no time limit).


              LESSON 8.4: MUTUAL FUND FEATURES

                         LO 8.e Recall special features of mutual funds.



                         Introduction
                         One of the reasons for the enormous popularity of mutual funds is the special features they
                         offer to investors. We will discuss those most likely to appear on your exam.


                         Cost of Entry
                         Many mutual funds allow initial investments of as low as $1,000. Once the account is
                         opened, additional investments may be made with as little as $25. In the case of IRAs, that
                         initial $1,000 might be as low as $100. With this tiny sum, the investor has the diversification

                                                                                                                                     Unit 8
                         of a portfolio of as many as several hundred different securities. Technically, it is said that the
                         owner of one share has an undivided interest in the entire portfolio of the fund. You might see
                         that term on your exam.


                         Dollar Cost Averaging
                         The low cost of entry makes dollar cost averaging available for even the smallest of investors.
                         One method of purchasing mutual fund shares is called dollar cost averaging, where a person
                         invests identical amounts at regular intervals. This form of investing allows the individual
                         to purchase more shares when prices are low, and fewer shares when prices are high. In a
                         fluctuating market and over time, the average cost per share is lower than the average price
                         of the shares. However, dollar cost averaging does not guarantee profits in a declining market
                         because prices may continue to decline for some time. In this case, the investor buys more
                         shares of a sinking investment.

                                    EXAMPLE
                                    The following illustrates how average price and average cost may vary with dollar cost
                                    averaging.

                                     Month        Amount Invested      Price Per Share No. of Shares

                                                   The average price per purchase is the sum of the prices paid divided by the number of
                                                   investments: $114 ÷ 4 = $28.50.
                                                   The average cost per share is total amount spent divided by the number of shares
                                                   purchased: $2,400 ÷ 90 = $26.67. This lower cost is because of automatically
                                                   purchasing more shares when the price was low and fewer shares when the price was
                                                   high.
                                                   In this case, the average cost is $1.83 per share less than the average price.

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   It is important to understand the concept of dollar cost averaging. It involves investing
                                                   a fixed amount of money every period, regardless of market price fluctuation.
                                                   If the market price of shares is up, fewer shares are purchased; if the market price of
                                                   shares is down, more shares are purchased. Over time, if the market fluctuates, dollar
                                                   cost averaging will achieve a lower average cost per share than average price per
                                                   share.
                                                   A frequent question on the exam relates a participant in a 401(k) plan regularly
                                                   investing in an index mutual fund as an example of dollar cost averaging.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   Dollar cost averaging neither guarantees profit nor protects from loss. It merely results
                                                   in a lower cost per share than the average price per share.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   8.   An investor who initially makes a small investment in a mutual fund may have the
                                                        advantage of a lower sales charge on investments made over a 13-month period
                                                        through
                                                          A. a breakpoint letter.
                                                         B. a Class A letter.
                                                         C. a letter of intent (LOI).
                                                         D. a sponsor’s letter.
                                                        Answer: C. Investors who sign a LOI stating they will invest a specified amount
                                                        over a 13-month period are eligible for a reduced sales load if they invest enough to
                                                        reach the breakpoint within that time. Breakpoints entitle investors to reduced sales
                                                        charges.


                                        Withdrawal Plans
                                        Mutual funds are not only easy to get into; they also have plans for orderly liquidation. In
                                        addition to lump-sum withdrawals, whereby customers sell all their shares, mutual funds offer
                                        systematic withdrawal plans. Withdrawal plans are normally a free service. Not all mutual
                                        funds offer withdrawal plans, but those that do may offer the plan alternatives described here.


                                        Fixed-Dollar
                                        A customer may request the periodic withdrawal of a fixed-dollar amount. Thus, the fund
                                        liquidates enough shares each period to send that sum. The amount of money liquidated may
                                        be more or less than the account earnings during the period.

                       Fixed Percentage or Fixed Share
                       Under a fixed-percentage or fixed-share withdrawal plan, either a fixed number of shares or a
                       fixed percentage of the account is liquidated each period.


                       Fixed-Time
                       Under a fixed-time withdrawal plan, customers liquidate their holdings over a fixed period.


                       Withdrawal Plan Disclosures
                       Withdrawal plans are not guaranteed. With fixed-dollar plans, only the dollar amount to be
                       received each period is fixed. All other factors, including the number of shares liquidated and
                       a plan’s length, are variable. For a fixed-time plan, only the time is fixed; the amount of money
                       the investor receives varies each period. Most mutual funds require a customer’s account to be
                       worth a minimum amount of money before a withdrawal plan may begin. Regardless of the
                       option chosen, it is rare for a fund to permit continued investment once withdrawals start.
                       Because withdrawal plans are not guaranteed, the registered representative must
                        never promise an investor a guaranteed rate of return,
                        stress to the investor that it is possible to exhaust the account by over-withdrawing,
                        state that during a down market it is possible that the account will be exhausted if the
                         investor withdraws even a small amount, and
                        never use charts or tables unless the SEC specifically clears their use.
                                                                                                                                    Unit 8
                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 9.   An investor has arranged to receive $600 per month from a mutual fund withdrawal
                                      plan. This is an example of what type of plan?
                                       A. Contractual
                                       B. Fixed-share periodic withdrawal
                                       C. Fixed-dollar periodic withdrawal
                                       D. Fixed-percentage withdrawal
                                      Answer: C. If the investor receives $600 a month, the dollar amount of the
                                      withdrawal is fixed. That makes this a fixed-dollar periodic withdrawal plan.


                       Voluntary Accumulation Plans
                       Mutual funds have a number of arrangements to implement an investment program. A
                       voluntary accumulation plan allows a customer to deposit regular periodic investments on
                       a voluntary basis (minimum amounts found in the prospectus). The plan is designed to help
                       the customer form regular investment habits while still offering some flexibility. This is an easy
                       way to take advantage of dollar cost averaging.

                       Voluntary accumulation plans may require a minimum initial purchase and minimum
                       additional purchase amounts. Many funds offer automatic withdrawal from customer
                       checking accounts to simplify contributions. If a customer misses a payment, there is no
                       penalty because the plan is voluntary. The customer may discontinue the plan at any time.

                                                   In a voluntary accumulation plan, once the account has been opened, contribution

                                        Exchanges Within a Family of Funds
                                        Many sponsors offer exchange or conversion privileges within their families of funds. A mutual
                                        fund family, (sometimes referred to as a fund complex), is when a single sponsor or distributor
                                        offers more than one fund. In many cases, there are more than a dozen funds with different
                                        objectives in the same fund complex. There are even a few with more than 100 funds.

                                        Exchange privileges allow an investor to convert an investment in one fund for an equal
                                        investment in another fund in the same family without incurring an additional sales charge.
                                        A common example would be an investor who purchased the XYZ Growth Fund at age 40.
                                        Now, that investor is 62 and, as retirement approaches, needs something more conservative.
                                        The shares of the XYZ Growth Fund can be exchanged for shares of the XYZ Income Fund at
                                        no expense. Any gain or loss from the redemption of shares must be reported for tax purposes.

                                        To have the exchange take place with no-load, the following rules apply:
                                         The purchase may not exceed the proceeds generated by the redemption of the other
                                          fund.
                                         The redemption may not involve a refund of sales charges.
                                         The sales personnel and dealers must receive no compensation of any kind from the
                                          reinvestment.

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   The exam wants you to know that this is a taxable event. If there is a gain (or loss), it
                                                   must be reported.

                                                       Answer: D. The conversion privilege is frequently referred to as the exchange
                                                       privilege. You need to know that, unlike conversion of a bond or preferred stock to
                                                       common stock, which is not a taxable event, converting from one fund to another is
                                                       considered a sale and new purchase. If the old shares have appreciated, there would
                                                       be a taxable capital gain.

                       LO 8.f Differentiate between the different kinds of tax treatment of mutual funds.



                       Introduction
                       Another special feature of mutual funds is the way they are taxed.

                       Most monies received by a taxpayer are subject to income tax. This includes salaries, bonuses,
                       commissions, tips, dividends, and interest. These are normally taxed as ordinary income.

                       Receipts from selling something for more (or less) than was originally paid for it fall under the
                       capital gains tax. If there was a gain, tax must be paid on it. If there was a loss, it can be used
                       to offset gains and income.

                       Mutual funds receive income in the form of dividends from the stocks in which they invest
                       and interest from bonds. They may also realize capital gains from the sale of securities, which
                       were held in the portfolio, that have appreciated in price.


                       Mutual Fund Dividend Distributions
                       A mutual fund may pay dividends to each shareholder in much the same way any other
                       corporations pay dividends to stockholders. The Investment Company Act of 1940 requires
                       a written statement to accompany dividend payments by management companies. Every
                       written statement made by or on behalf of a management company must clearly indicate
                       what the payment per share is made from. Mutual fund dividends are typically paid from the

                                                                                                                                      Unit 8
                       mutual fund’s net investment income, usually on a quarterly basis.

                       Dividends may be identified as qualified or nonqualified. Qualified dividends are taxed at the
                       lower long-term capital gains rate. Nonqualified dividends are taxed as ordinary income.


                       Net Investment Income (NII)
                       Net investment income (NII) includes gross investment income—dividend and interest
                       income from securities held in the portfolio—minus operating expenses. Advertising and
                       sales expenses are not included in a fund’s operating expenses when calculating NII, but
                       management fees, custodian bank charges, and legal and accounting fees are included.

                            NII = dividends + interest – expenses of the fund

                                  TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                  You may see a question on the exam that asks for this calculation and gives a list of
                                  items to exclude or include in the calculation. Remember D + I – E, and it will be easy
                                  to remember which items to include. Note that capital gains are not a part of NII.

                                  TAKE NOTE
                                  A bond fund does not pay interest to investors. Investors buy common stock of the
                                  bond fund and, therefore, will receive a dividend if declared. Even though it is a
                                  dividend, because the source is interest it is taxed as interest. That is why you can
                                  receive a dividend from a municipal bond fund that is tax-free.

                                        The Conduit Theory
                                        Because an investment company is organized as a corporation or trust, you might correctly
                                        assume its earnings are subject to tax. Consider, however, how an additional level of taxation
                                        shrinks a dividend distribution value.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   Triple taxation? GEM Fund, Inc., owns shares of Mountain Brewing Co. To start with,
                                                   Mountain Brewing is taxed on its earnings before it pays a dividend. Then, GEM Fund
                                                   pays tax on the amount of the dividend it receives. Finally, the investor pays income
                                                   tax on the distribution from the fund.
                                        Triple taxation of investment income can be avoided if the mutual fund qualifies under
                                        Subchapter M of the IRC. If a mutual fund acts as a conduit (pipeline) for the distribution
                                        of NII, the fund may qualify as a regulated investment company (RIC). This means it is
                                        subject to tax only on the amount of NII the fund retains. The portion of the NII distributed
                                        to shareholders escapes taxation at the mutual fund level.

                                        To avoid taxation under Subchapter M, a fund must distribute at least 90% of its NII to
                                        shareholders. The fund then pays taxes only on the undistributed amount.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   If a fund distributes 89%, it must pay taxes on 100% of NII.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   What are the tax consequences to a fund that distributes 98% of its NII? In this
                                                   situation, the fund does not pay taxes on the 98% that is distributed; it pays taxes only
                                                   on the 2% of retained earnings.

                                                       Answer: B. Regulated companies under Subchapter M of the IRS Code are allowed
                                                       to pass-through income to beneficial owners without a tax at the fund level on the
                                                       distributed income (known as conduit or flow-through of income and taxation).


                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   Most closed-end companies, including BDCs, qualify as RICs for the tax benefit to
                                                   investors.


                                        Mutual Fund Capital Gains Distributions
                                        The appreciation or depreciation of portfolio securities is unrealized capital gain or loss if
                                        the fund does not sell the securities. Therefore, shareholders experience no tax consequences.
                                        When the fund sells the securities, the gain or loss is realized. A realized gain is an actual profit
                                        made.




Series_7_2E.indb 198                                                                                                                       11/19/2021 7:52:48 PM
                                                                                        Unit 8   Investment Companies     199


                       Capital gains distributions are derived from net realized gains. That is, the fund compares its
                       realized gains and losses to determine the net result. The distinction between long-term and
                       short-term is the same as for any investment. To avoid an extra level of taxation, the fund can
                       qualify as an RIC by distributing at least 90% of the net gain. As a practical (and test relevant)
                       matter, the fund will only distribute its long-term capital gains. Because of the conduit nature
                       of the distribution, the IRS says investors always report these on their tax returns as long-term
                       capital gains. This is true even if the investor purchased the fund shares only a month before
                       the distribution. It is because it is a distribution of the fund’s long-term gains. A long-term
                       capital gains distribution may not be made more often than once per taxable year.

                       What about net short-term capital gains? They are distributed along with the dividend. They
                       are noted as a nonqualified dividend and are taxed at ordinary income rates.

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 Long-term capital gain distributions may be made no more than once per year.
                                 A short-term capital gain is identified and distributed, but taxed as a dividend
                                 distribution, and taxed at ordinary income tax rates.

                                 TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                 The exam is fond of asking a question like this: An investor purchases shares of a
                                 mutual fund. Three months later, the fund has a long-term capital gains distribution.
                                 This would be taxed to the investor as ______?
                                 The answer is long-term capital gain. Why? It makes no difference how long the
                                 investor held the fund shares; this is a distribution of the fund’s long-term gains being
                                 passed through to the investor.                                                                    Unit 8
                                 However, when the investor sells his shares, then the holding period of those shares is
                                 important for determining long-term or short-term status.

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 The terms realized gains and unrealized gains can be confusing. Think of an
                                 unrealized gain as a paper profit and a realized gain as actual profit made.

                                 EXAMPLE
                                 If you purchased 100 shares of ABC stock at $100 per share and the market value
                                 of ABC is now $150 per share, you would experience an unrealized gain of $5,000,
                                 ($15,000 – $10,000). We call this a paper profit because the gain is only on paper. You
                                 would have no taxes to pay on this paper profit. If you sold the shares, the $5,000
                                 would be taxable to you as a capital gain. The gain resulting from a sale is known as a
                                 realized gain. Unrealized profits are not taxable; realized profits are taxable as capital
                                 gains.

                                                       Answer: D. The factors used to determine the tax due on a capital gains distribution
                                                       are the length of time the fund held the securities before selling them, which would
                                                       identify the gain as long- or short-term, and the investor’s tax bracket, which would
                                                       determine the actual percentage of tax due. In virtually every case on the exam, the
                                                       distribution will be of the fund’s long-term capital gains.

                                        A mutual fund portfolio that has increased in value has unrealized profits; these are not
                                        taxable to investors. But when the fund sells appreciated portfolio securities, it has realized
                                        profits. These profits are distributed as capital gains to shareholders. Shareholders can take
                                        these capital gain distributions in cash or reinvest them to purchase additional shares. In either
                                        case, these distributions are taxable as capital gains to shareholders.


                                        Reinvestment of Distributions
                                        Dividends and capital gains are distributed in cash. However, a shareholder may elect to
                                        reinvest distributions in additional mutual fund shares. The automatic reinvestment of
                                        distributions is similar to compounding interest. The reinvested distributions purchase
                                        additional shares, which may earn dividends or gains distributions.

                                        All mutual funds formed after April 1, 2000, must offer the reinvestment of dividends and
                                        capital gains back into the fund without a sales charge (at NAV). In practice, almost all funds
                                        formed before that date do this as well. This means that investors are able to buy new shares
                                        without a sales load. This is a significant advantage resulting in faster growth to the investor.


                                        Taxation of Reinvested Distributions
                                        Distributions are taxable to shareholders whether the distributions are received in cash or
                                        reinvested. The IRS uses the concept of constructive receipt. That means income, such as
                                        dividends, although not actually physically received by the taxpayer, is constructively received
                                        in the taxable year during which it is credited to his account or otherwise made available.
                                        All that is required is that the taxpayer could have drawn upon it during the taxable year if
                                        intention to withdraw had been given.
                                        The fund must disclose whether each distribution is from income or capital gains.
                                        Form 1099-DIV, which is sent to shareholders after the close of the year, details tax
                                        information related to dividend distributions for the year. This enables the investor to enter
                                        the proper information on the investor’s Form 1040.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   Just as with dividend distributions, whether capital gains are taken in cash or
                                                   reinvested, they are currently taxable to the shareholder. Dividends will be reported as
                                                   qualified (taxed at a lower rate) or nonqualified (taxed as ordinary income).
                                                   Any short-term capital gain is distributed as a nonqualified dividend. It is the
                                                   shareholder’s responsibility to report all dividends and long-term capital gains
                                                   distributions to the IRS and state tax agency.

                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                    13. A registered representative has recommended a growth and income fund to her
                                        client because the fund pays relatively high income and maintains strong capital
                                        appreciation. The client wishes to use the fund as the foundation of a long-term
                                        strategy for eventual retirement. The representative’s recommendations and
                                        disclosures should state that
                                          A. the client should reinvest any dividend and capital gain distributions to
                                              accelerate the growth process through a compounding effect.
                                          B. the client should take any dividend and gain distributions in cash and invest
                                              them in a growth fund of another fund family for diversification.
                                          C. all capital appreciation of securities within the fund are distributed on an
                                              annual basis.
                                         D. if dividends are reinvested, they are not currently taxable, which enhances
                                              growth within the fund.
                                        Answer: A. Because the client’s goal is to use the fund as part of a long-term
                                        strategy for retirement, reinvestment of distributions should be encouraged. The
                                        compounding effect of reinvestment increases the number of shares upon which
                                        distributions are based during each period. The fact that distributions are taxable—
                                        whether taken in cash or reinvested—must be disclosed to the client. Net realized
                                        long-term capital gains of the portfolio are distributed annually.

                         Introduction
                         Although suitability is a requirement when recommending any investment, the exam seems
                         to devote more questions to selecting the proper mutual fund. That is why we have a mutual
                         fund suitability exercise for you. In this lesson, we will give you the tools to enable you to be
                         able to select the right fund for the client. While there are literally thousands of individual
                         mutual funds, there are only a handful of major fund categories:
                          Stock funds invest in stocks
                          Bond funds invest in bonds
                          Balanced funds invest in a combination of stocks and bonds
                          Money market funds invest in very short-term investments


                         Investor Objectives
                         Back in Lesson 2.4, we described goals and objectives and the difference between them. Here,
                         we are going to focus on what kind of funds should be recommended to meet each objective.
                         Following is a description of the major types of funds and where they fit into the GIS triangle
                         (including speculation).


                         Stock Funds
                         A mutual fund, which uses stock to meet its stated objectives, can generally be referred to as
                         a stock fund. Common stock is normally found in the portfolio of any mutual fund that has




Series_7_2E.indb 201                                                                                                     11/19/2021 7:52:49 PM

                                        growth as a primary or secondary objective. Equity funds have historically outpaced inflation
                                        over most 10-year time horizons.


                                        Growth/Value Funds
                                        Growth funds invest in stocks of companies whose businesses are growing rapidly. Growth
                                        companies tend to reinvest all or most of their profits for research and development rather
                                        than pay dividends. Growth funds are focused on generating capital gains rather than income.

                                        Growth managers may consider stocks that many feel are overvalued because there may still be
                                        upside potential. As such, funds managed for growth tend to have elevated levels of risk.

                                        Blue-chip or conservative growth funds invest in established and more recognized companies
                                        to achieve growth with less risk. Generally, these funds own shares of companies with fairly
                                        large market capitalization. Market cap, as it is usually referred to, is the total number of
                                        shares of common stock outstanding multiplied by the current market value per share. So a
                                        listed company with 300 million shares outstanding where the share price is $50 would have
                                        a market cap of $15 billion and would be considered a large-cap stock. Funds investing in
                                        stocks like this are sometimes called large-cap funds (their portfolio consists of companies
                                        with a market capitalization of more than $10 billion). These types of funds can be more
                                        stable and less volatile in a turbulent market.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   An investor who is willing to take moderate risk and is willing to invest for a minimum
                                                   of 5–7 years may be interested in a blue-chip or large-cap growth fund.


                                        Aggressive Growth Funds
                                        Aggressive growth funds are sometimes called performance funds. These funds are willing
                                        to take greater risk to maximize capital appreciation. Some of these funds invest in newer
                                        companies with relatively small capitalization (less than $2 billion capitalization) and are
                                        called small-cap funds.

                                        Mid-cap funds are somewhat less aggressive and have in their portfolios shares of companies
                                        with a market capitalization of between $2 billion and $10 billion.

                                        Large-cap funds have market capitalization of greater than $10 billion. The lower the market
                                        cap, the greater the volatility.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   An investor who is seeking high potential returns with the understanding that there
                                                   can also be significant losses and is willing to invest for 10–15 years may be interested
                                                   in an aggressive growth fund that focuses on small- or mid-cap companies.


                                        Value Funds
                                        Value funds (and, therefore, value managers) focus on companies whose stocks are currently
                                        undervalued (earnings potential is not reflected in the stock price). These undervalued
                                        companies are expected to perform better than the reports indicate, thus providing an
                                        opportunity to profit. Value stocks typically have dividend yields higher than growth stocks.
                                        Funds managed for value are considered more conservative than funds managed for growth.

                                 EXAMPLE
                                 An investor who is willing to take moderate risk when investing to purchase a vacation
                                 home in 7–10 years may be interested in a fund that is value-oriented.


                       Equity Income Funds
                       An income fund primarily composed of stock, also known as an equity income fund, stresses
                       current income over growth. The fund’s objective may be accomplished by investing in the
                       stocks of companies with long histories of dividend payments, such as utility company stocks,
                       blue-chip stocks, and preferred stocks. These are managed for income, not growth.

                                 EXAMPLE
                                 An investor who is willing to take low to moderate risk and seeks income from equity
                                 investments in the form of dividends with some capital appreciation may be interested
                                 in an equity income fund, utility fund, or preferred stock fund.


                       Option Income Funds
                       Option income funds invest in securities on which call options can be sold (known as
                       covered calls). They earn premium income from writing (selling) the options. They may also
                       earn capital gains from trading options at a profit. These funds seek to increase total return by
                       adding income generated by the options to appreciation on the securities held in the portfolio.
                       They generally have greater risk than other income funds.


                       Growth and Income Funds                                                                                   Unit 8
                       A growth and income fund (combination fund) may attempt to combine the objectives of
                       growth and current income by diversifying its stock portfolio among companies showing
                       long-term growth potential and companies paying high dividends. Often, both value and
                       growth management styles are utilized.

                                 EXAMPLE
                                 An investor seeking dividends and capital appreciation with moderate risk may be
                                 interested in a growth and income fund.


                       Specialized (Sector) Funds
                       Many funds attempt to specialize in particular economic sectors or geographic areas. These
                       funds must have a minimum of 25% of their assets invested in their specialties. Sector funds
                       offer high appreciation potential, but may also pose higher risks to the investor as a result of
                       the concentration of investments. These funds are speculative in nature. They include gold,
                       technology, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology funds, but can also be geographic, such as
                       investing in companies located in the Pacific Basin or Silicon Valley.

                                 EXAMPLE
                                 An investor who believes the pharmaceutical industry is going to outperform the
                                 market over the next 5–10 years and is willing to speculate on the investment may be
                                 interested in a sector fund that focuses on the pharmaceutical industry.

                                        Special situation funds buy securities of companies that may benefit from a change within
                                        the companies or in the economy. Takeover candidates and turnaround situations are
                                        common investments. These funds are also speculative (high risk).

                                                   mergers and acquisitions. They are willing to take additional risk to possibly profit
                                                   from the potential consolidation of the industry. They may be interested in a special

                                        Blend/Core Funds
                                        Blend/core funds are stock funds with a portfolio comprising a number of different classes of
                                        stock. Such a fund might include both blue-chip stocks and high-risk/high-potential-return
                                        growth stocks. Both growth and value management styles are used. The purpose is to allow
                                        investors to diversify their investment via management and securities in a single fund.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   Value funds are considered more conservative than growth or blend/core funds.

                                                       providing current income to its shareholders would most likely choose
                                                        A. a common stock fund.
                                                        B. a growth fund.
                                                        C. an income fund.
                                                        D. a venture capital fund.
                                                       Answer: C. Income funds have the goal of producing income; that is why they are
                                                       named as such. This is a case where you “don’t look a gift horse in the mouth.”


                                        Index Funds
                                        Index funds invest in securities that mirror a market index, such as the S&P 500. An index
                                        fund buys and sells securities in a manner that mirrors the composition of the selected index.

                                        The index may be broad, such as the S&P 500, or narrow, such as a transportation index.
                                        The fund’s performance should closely track the underlying index performance. Turnover of
                                        securities in an index fund’s portfolio is minimal because the only trades that take place are
                                        triggered by a change in the index (one company is replaced by another company). As a result,
                                        an index fund generally has lower management costs than other types of funds.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   An investor does not believe in paying for the professional stock selection of a
                                                   managed fund. In other words, the belief is that it is difficult to outperform the market
                                                   as a whole (or in part). Under these circumstances, recommending an index fund is
                                                   appropriate.

                       Foreign Stock Funds
                       The global economy has made investing in foreign securities more attractive than ever. Many
                       foreign businesses have become household names in the United States, and the interest in
                       investing in those companies has followed their popularity. In Lesson 3.2, we learned about
                       American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) for individual stock purchases. Here, we will discuss
                       the choices with mutual funds.


                       International Funds
                       International funds invest only in the securities of foreign companies. These companies
                       have their headquarters and principal business activities outside the United States. Long-term
                       capital appreciation is their primary objective, although some funds also seek current income.


                       Global Funds
                       Global funds and worldwide funds invest in the securities of both the United States and
                       foreign countries. The risks involved in a fund concentrating in foreign securities are
                       somewhat different than those for a domestic fund. When a portfolio has a large percentage
                       of foreign securities, currency risk and political risk become paramount. These risks are
                       elevated when investing in frontier funds, which invest in pre-emerging economies, because
                       accounting and regulatory schemes are often much less rigorous than what we are used to here
                       in the United States.

                       International and global stock funds are often purchased to diversify an investor’s portfolio.
                       After all, investing inside and outside the United States provides a more diversified portfolio
                       than just investing within the United States.                                                               Unit 8

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 There are two terms generally used to describe funds that invest in foreign securities.
                                     International funds have their entire portfolio invested in securities issued
                                      outside of the United States. The way to remember that is if you will be traveling
                                      internationally, you’ll be outside the United States.
                                     Global funds have the portfolio invested around the globe, and that includes U.S.
                                      securities. Once again, using the travel example, if you were to travel around the
                                      globe, a portion of your trip would be in the United States.


                       Balanced Funds
                       Balanced funds, also known as hybrid funds, invest in stocks for appreciation and bonds for
                       income. In a balanced fund, different types of securities are purchased according to a formula
                       the manager may adjust to reflect market conditions.

                       A balanced fund’s portfolio might contain 60% stocks and 40% bonds.

                                 EXAMPLE
                                 A balanced fund may be appropriate for an investor who seeks a conservative balance
                                 between stocks and bonds.

                                        Asset Allocation Funds
                                        Asset allocation funds split investments between stocks for growth, bonds for income,
                                        and money market instruments or cash for stability. Fund advisers switch the percentage of
                                        holdings in each asset category according to the performance (or expected performance) of
                                        that group. These funds can also hold hard assets, such as precious metals like gold and silver,
                                        and real estate.

                                        A fund may have 60% of its investments in stock, 20% in bonds, and the remaining 20% in
                                        cash. If the stock market is expected to do well, the adviser may switch from cash and bonds
                                        to stock. The result may be a portfolio of 80% in stock, 10% in bonds, and 10% in cash.

                                        Conversely, if the stock market is expected to decline, the fund may invest heavily in cash and
                                        sell stocks.

                                        Many asset allocation funds are target funds (see the following) that target a specific goal—
                                        such as retirement—in a 5-, 10-, 15-, or 20-year period. As the target year gets closer, the mix
                                        of investments becomes more conservative.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   An investor seeks an investment for retirement in 20 years that performs well under
                                                   most market conditions and is diversified by purchasing multiple types of securities.
                                                   An asset allocation fund that targets the year of retirement may be appropriate.


                                        Target-Date Funds
                                        One increasingly popular investment option is a target-date fund, sometimes called a life-
                                        cycle fund. According to a report by a large retirement plan provider, target-date funds are
                                        offered by nearly 90% of employer-sponsored defined contribution plans, such as 401(k)
                                        plans.

                                        Target-date funds are designed to help manage investment risk. This is done by selecting a
                                        fund with a target date in mind that is closest to the year an investor anticipates needing the
                                        money (i.e., retiring in 2030). For example, a 2030 fund gradually reduces risk by changing
                                        the investments within the fund to a more conservative mix as the target date approaches.
                                        That said, target-date funds are not risk-free, even when the target date has been reached.

                                        FINRA is concerned that many investors surveyed do not understand that target-date funds
                                        do not provide guaranteed income. Many investors also did not realize that similar-sounding
                                        funds may, in fact, have different investments and risk profiles.

                                        Like all investments, target-date funds can lose money if the stocks and bonds owned by the
                                        fund drop in value. And even though funds with identical target dates may look the same,
                                        they may have very different investment strategies and asset allocations that can affect how
                                        risky they are and what they are worth, at any given point in time, including when and after
                                        retirement takes place.


                                        Bond Funds
                                        Bond funds have income as their main investment objective. Some funds invest solely
                                        in investment-grade corporate bonds. Others, seeking enhanced safety, invest only in
                                        government issues. Still others seek to maximize current income by investing in lower-rated
                                        (junk) bonds for higher yields.

                                 TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                 Remember the following:
                                    Bonds pay interest; bond funds pay dividends if declared by the fund’s BOD.
                                    Dividends are typically paid on a quarterly or semiannual basis, but there are
                                     income funds (both equity- and debt-oriented) that pay monthly dividends.
                                    When interest rates rise, the prices of bonds, and, therefore, bond funds, fall (and
                                     vice versa).


                       Corporate Bond Funds
                       Corporate bond funds, in general, have higher credit risk than various government issues but
                       can still be classified as investment-grade (safer) or noninvestment-grade (riskier) portfolios.

                       As we have covered before, the greater the risk, the greater the reward. High-yield bond
                       funds provide the highest yields because of their increased credit risk and are considered
                       speculative investments.


                       Tax-Free (Tax-Exempt) Bond Funds and UITs
                       Municipal bond funds and UITs invest in municipal bonds or notes that produce income
                       (dividends) exempt from federal income tax. These funds are appropriate for investors in a
                       high marginal tax bracket seeking income.

                                 EXAMPLE
                                 The current tax system includes brackets. The tax bracket is defined as the percentage            Unit 8
                                 of tax due on the next dollar the individual will receive. This is called your marginal
                                 income tax bracket. An investor is in a high marginal tax bracket and seeks income. A
                                 municipal bond fund may be appropriate.


                       U.S. Government Funds
                       U.S. government funds purchase securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or an agency of the
                       U.S. government, such as Ginnie Mae. Investors in these funds seek current income and
                       maximum safety. Agency security funds are not considered quite as safe from default risk as
                       U.S. government funds; therefore, the yields on agency security funds will be higher than U.S.
                       government fund yields.


                       Agency Funds
                       The word agencies is a generic term used to describe two types of bonds: bonds issued or
                       guaranteed by U.S. federal government agencies, and bonds issued by government-sponsored
                       enterprises (GSEs)—corporations created by Congress to foster a public purpose, such as
                       affordable housing.

                       Bonds issued or guaranteed by certain federal agencies such as the GNMA are backed by the
                       full faith and credit of the U.S. government, just like Treasuries. This is an unconditional
                       commitment to pay interest payments and to return the principal investment in full to you
                       when a debt security reaches maturity.

                       Bonds issued by most GSEs, such as the FNMA and the FHLMC, are not backed by the same
                       guarantee as federal government agencies.

                                                   An investor is risk averse and seeks income, but the U.S. government bond fund yields
                                                   are too low. An agency security fund may be appropriate.


                                        Principal-Protected Funds
                                        Principal-protected mutual funds offer investors a guarantee of principal, adjusted for fund
                                        dividends and distributions, on a set future date (maturity) while providing opportunities for
                                        higher returns through investment in higher risk and higher expected return asset classes such
                                        as equities. The basic guarantee is that the investor’s return will never be less than the original
                                        investment, less any sales load.

                                        The guarantees are sometimes provided by third-party insurers and at other times through
                                        investments in U.S. Treasury zero coupon bonds. These appealing properties have led to
                                        considerable interest on the part of investors who have invested billions of dollars in such
                                        mutual funds in recent years. The usefulness and attractiveness of these principal-protected
                                        mutual funds is limited by three factors.
                                         Guarantee principal. Most principal-protected funds guarantee the initial investment
                                          minus any front-end sales charge even if the stock markets fall. In many cases, the
                                          guarantee is backed by an insurance policy.
                                         Lock-up period. If you sell any shares in the fund before the end of the guarantee period—a
                                          period of anywhere from 5 to 10 years—you lose the guarantee on those shares and could
                                          lose money if the share price has fallen since your initial investment.
                                         Hold a mixture of bonds and stocks. Most principal-protected funds invest a portion of the
                                          fund in zero coupon bonds and other debt securities, and a portion in stocks and other
                                          equity investments during the guarantee period. To ensure the fund can support the
                                          guarantee, many of these funds may be almost entirely invested in zero coupon bonds or
                                          other debt securities when interest rates are low and equity markets are volatile. Because
                                          this allocation provides less exposure to the markets, it may eliminate or greatly reduce
                                          any potential gains the fund can achieve from subsequent gains in the stock market. It
                                          also may increase the risk to the fund of rising interest rates, which generally cause bond
                                          prices to fall.

                                        Principal-protected funds are typically front-end loaded, and their operating expense ratios
                                        tend to be higher than comparable funds.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   An investor is very risk averse but wishes to invest without the possibility of losing the
                                                   principal of the investment. A principal-protected fund may be appropriate.

                                                   15. If ABC Fund pays regular dividends, offers a high degree of safety of principal, and

                                      Answer: D. Municipal bonds are considered second only to U.S. government
                                      securities in terms of safety. Furthermore, whenever you see a question about an
                                      investor in a high tax bracket, always look for the answer choice with municipal
                                      bonds; the tax-free income is the key. On the other hand, when you see growth,
                                      dividends will probably not be part of the equation.


                       Money Market Funds
                       Money market funds are no-load, open-end investment companies (mutual funds) that serve
                       as temporary holding accounts for investors’ money. As the name implies, the portfolio of
                       a money market fund consists of money market securities. Money market mutual funds are
                       most suitable for investors whose financial goals require liquidity above all.

                       The interest these funds earn and distribute as dividends is computed daily and credited to
                       customer accounts monthly. In general, money market mutual funds offer check-writing
                       privileges, making for extraordinary liquidity. Because all of the income is from interest, these
                       dividends are taxed as interest.

                       The NAV of money market funds is generally fixed at $1 per share. Although this price is not
                       guaranteed, a fund is managed to “break the buck,” regardless of market changes. Thus, the
                       price of money market shares does not fluctuate in response to changing interest rates.

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 Money market mutual funds (MMF) for retail investors are designed to have a
                                 stable NAV of $1 per share. They are not guaranteed, nor are they protected by FDIC

                                                                                                                                   Unit 8
                                 insurance. It is rare, but it is possible to lose money in a money market mutual fund as
                                 a retail investor.
                       It is not likely to be tested, but an important distinction between institutional and retail
                       money market funds lies in the pricing of the funds. Retail money market funds are allowed
                       to keep a NAV of $1 per share. Institutional funds, on the other hand, have a floating NAV.
                       This means that the price can change from day to day, based on the conditions of the market.
                       The only other MMFs with a stable NAV are institutional money market funds, which are
                       99.5% government securities.

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 16. An investor has a portfolio diversified among many different asset classes. If there
                                     was an immediate need for cash, which of the following would probably be the most
                                     liquid?
                                       A. Cash value from a universal life insurance policy
                                       B. CDL Common Stock Mutual Fund
                                       C. QRS Money Market Mutual Fund
                                       D. XYZ International Stock Mutual Fund
                                      Answer: C. Money market funds generally come with a check-writing privilege,
                                      offering investors the opportunity to convert the asset to cash at once. Although all
                                      mutual funds are readily redeemable, the fund has seven days to redeem. One must
                                      request the cash value from the insurance company and, in many cases, it can take
                                      30 days or longer.

                                                   Be aware that an investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by
                                                   the FDIC or any other government agency. Although a money market fund seeks to
                                                   preserve the value of the investment at $1 per share, it is possible to lose money by
                                                   investing in a money market fund.


           LESSON 8.6: EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS (ETFS)
                                        LO 8.h Recognize the different features and types of ETFs.



                                        Types of ETFs
                                        An ETF registers with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940 either as a unit
                                        investment trust (UIT ETF) or as an open-end management company (open-end ETF).


                                        Standard ETF
                                        In most cases, an ETF invests in a specific index, such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones. Any
                                        class of asset that has a published index around it and is liquid can be made into an ETF so
                                        that there are ETFs for real estate and commodities as well as stocks and bonds. In this way,
                                        an ETF is similar to an index mutual fund. The difference is that the ETFs trades like a stock
                                        on an exchange or Nasdaq and, in this way, is similar to a closed-end investment company.
                                        The investor can take advantage of price changes that are due to the market, rather than just
                                        the underlying value of the stocks in the portfolio.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   Although, as stated, most ETFs are passive in that they are based on some index, in
                                                   recent years, there has been a growth in actively managed ETFs where, instead of
                                                   attempting to mirror an index, the managers select individual assets based upon
                                                   expected performance. Therefore, there are ETFs that purchase equities only, fixed
                                                   income securities only, or a combination. Some even purchase non-securities assets
                                                   such as commodities.
                                        ETFs can be purchased on margin and sold short (covered in Unit 16), just like any other
                                        listed stock. This is another difference between ETFs and mutual funds. Expenses tend to be
                                        lower than those of mutual funds as well, because all the adviser has to do is match up to the
                                        specified index, so the fees are minimal. In addition, there can be tax advantages to owning
                                        ETFs.

                                        However, because there are brokerage commissions on each trade (in and out), ETFs are
                                        generally not competitive with a no-load index fund for the small investor making regular
                                        periodic investments such as in a dollar cost averaging plan.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   There are now some U.S.-listed ETFs that are available for commission-free trading
                                                   on certain select platforms (these are typically proprietary funds). These products
                                                   can be bought and sold without traditional brokerage commissions for investors with
                                                   certain accounts and subject to certain restrictions. For exam purposes, these are the
                                                   exceptions rather than the rule.

                                                                                       Unit 8   Investment Companies     211


                       Most ETFs are open-end companies, but they cannot be referred to as mutual funds because
                       shares are not redeemable by the issuer. Furthermore, as a result of all trading taking place
                       in the secondary markets, delivery of a prospectus is not required. Because ETFs trade on
                       exchanges in the same manner as CEFs, there is a tendency to equate them. As mentioned
                       earlier, ETFs are not actively managed. CEFs are management companies with full time,
                       active portfolio managers.

                       Pricing is different as well. CEFs usually trade at some distance from their NAVs. The CEF’s
                       trading price is independent of its NAV. It could be a premium or a discount because the
                       price is determined by supply and demand. On the other hand, ETFs trade at, or very close
                       to, their NAVs.

                       The exam may ask you for some of the uses of ETFs. You may not know what all of these are,
                       but the test doesn’t ask for explanations. Here are some of the uses of index ETFs:
                        Asset allocation
                        Following industry trends
                        Balancing a portfolio
                        Speculative trading
                        Hedging

                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                  17. Which of the following is not touted as an advantage to purchasing ETFs instead of
                                      index mutual funds?
                                        A. Intraday trading
                                        B. Typically lower expense ratios                                                          Unit 8
                                        C. Performance is generally better than the underlying index
                                        D. Can be purchased on margin
                                      Answer: C. One thing that neither of these products can claim is performance better
                                      than the underlying index. Think about it—the index has no management fees.
                                      Even though the management fees on index funds are very low and those on ETFs
                                      are generally lower than that, there are still expenses making it unlikely that their
                                      performance can beat that of the index. The fact that an investor can trade the ETF
                                      during the day instead of accepting whatever the next computed price is, can be a
                                      benefit for those who are trying to time the market. And, for those who wish to add
                                      the leverage of margin trading (explained more fully in Unit 16), that can only be done
                                      with ETFs, not index mutual funds.


                       Leveraged ETFs
                       These funds attempt to deliver a multiple of the return of the benchmark index they are
                       designated to track. For instance, a 2x leveraged fund would try to deliver two times the
                       return of whatever index it is tracking. With leveraged funds, there are no limits by rule
                       or regulation as to the amount of leverage that could be applied to a portfolio. Currently,
                       there are numerous 2x and 3x leveraged funds available to investors. The risk associated with
                       leverage is that it is always a double-edged sword; volatility is magnified. Therefore, the risk
                       to be recognized regarding this fund strategy is that if the benchmark index is falling, then
                       the fund’s returns will be—in theory—the designated leverage amount (perhaps two or three)
                       times the loss. In addition, most of these funds use derivatives products such as options,
                       futures, and swaps to enable them to achieve the stated goal. Because these derivative products
                       are not suitable for all investors, so too can it be said of the leverage fund portfolio containing
                       them. Ultimately, as always, suitability becomes an issue when recommending these products.

                                        Inverse (Reverse) Funds
                                        Inverse funds, sometimes referred to as reverse or short funds, attempt to deliver returns that
                                        are the opposite of the benchmark index they are tracking. For example, if the benchmark
                                        is down 2%, the fund’s goal is to be up 2%. In addition, inverse funds can also be leveraged
                                        funds, or said another way, two or three times the opposite of the indices’ return. They are
                                        called short funds because they have a bearish attitude.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   Consider an inverse fund tracking the S&P 500. If the index were to drop by 1%, the
                                                   value of the inverse fund would rise by 1%. If this was a 3x inverse fund, then the fund’s
                                                   value would rise by 3%. Of course, if the index were to rise, the performance of the
                                                   inverse fund would suffer, especially if it was leveraged.

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   FINRA warns investors that most leveraged and inverse ETFs reset daily, meaning
                                                   that they are designed to achieve their stated objectives on a daily basis. Their
                                                   performance over longer periods of time—over weeks, months, or years—can differ
                                                   significantly from the performance (or inverse of the performance) of their underlying
                                                   index or benchmark during the same period. Therefore, in most cases, these would
                                                   not be suitable investments for buy-and-hold investors or those with other than a very
                                                   short time horizon.
                                        For the TVIX, (VelocityShares Daily 2x VIX ST ETN), one of the risk disclosures (page 28,
                                        PS-28) reads like this:

                                             The long-term expected value of your ETNs is zero. If you hold your ETNs as a
                                             long-term investment, it is likely that you will lose all or a substantial portion of
                                             your investment.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   Both leveraged and inverse index funds (leveraged or not) can be traded on an
                                                   exchange. When they are, they are known as ETFs. If the shares are exchange-traded,
                                                   they are priced by supply and demand, can be purchased on margin, and bought and
                                                   sold throughout the trading day, like all exchange-traded products. For those that are
                                                   not exchange-traded (e.g., inverse mutual funds), they would be priced, purchased,
                                                   and redeemed like all investment company shares. Neither of these fund types carry
                                                   any guarantee that they will achieve the stated goal or objective.


           LESSON 8.7: INVESTMENT COMPANY BENEFITS AND RISKS

                                        LO 8.i Explain the benefits and risks of investment companies in client portfolios.



                                        Introduction
                                        As you have seen, there are many different types of investment companies. In the course
                                        of discussing them, we have touched on some of the benefits and risks. This lesson will
                                        summarize all of them and include a few additional ones.




Series_7_2E.indb 212                                                                                                                       11/19/2021 7:52:50 PM
                                                                                     Unit 8   Investment Companies     213


                       Benefits of Including Investment Company Securities in Client
                       Portfolios
                       When it comes to benefits in general, they all share two important characteristics:
                        Diversification. By pooling assets with many others, investors have the opportunity to own
                         an interest in a far greater number and range of securities than available to almost any
                         individual investor.
                        Professional management. In almost all cases, someone with expertise (we hope) is
                         “minding the store.” Even in the case of the UIT where there is no ongoing management,
                         the initial portfolio is constructed by experts. And, although index funds and ETFs
                         don’t require real decision making by the fund managers, they are there making sure the
                         portfolio is updated whenever the components of the index change.

                       Let’s examine each of the different types of investment companies we’ve learned about.


                       Mutual Fund Benefits
                       In addition to the obvious diversification and professional management, there are multiple
                       benefits to owning mutual funds.


                       Choice of Objectives
                       Whatever an investor’s investment objectives are, there are mutual funds available to match.
                       There are many shades of growth funds, from highly aggressive to very conservative. All have
                       the goal of growing the investment. The same is true with income funds where the goal is
                       to generate current income with varying degrees of risk from government bonds to high-                    Unit 8
                       yield bonds. If the objective is capital preservation, money market funds fit the bill and then
                       there are funds that combine objectives, such as growth and income funds. There are even
                       specialized funds (sector funds) which concentrate at least 25% of their portfolio into specific
                       industries or geographic areas, such as a biotech fund or a Southeast Asia fund.


                       Convenience
                       With most mutual funds, buying and liquidating shares, changing reinvestment options, and
                       getting information can be accomplished conveniently by going to the fund’s website, by
                       calling a toll-free phone number, or by mail.


                       Liquidity
                       The Investment Company Act of 1940 requires that an open-end investment company stand
                       ready to redeem shares at the next computed NAV per share. Payment must be made within
                       seven days of the redemption request. Although there may be a redemption charge, and, of
                       course, the value of the shares may be less than their cost, liquidity is assured.


                       Minimum Initial Investment
                       As mentioned previously, it doesn’t take a great deal of wealth to get started investing in funds
                       and, generally, once you are a shareholder, most funds permit additional investments of $100
                       or even less.

                                        Automated Investing and Withdrawal
                                        As covered earlier in the unit, investors can start voluntary accumulation plans where set
                                        amounts are invested at regular intervals. Or, on the other end, automatic withdrawal plans
                                        are available using one of the various withdrawal options.


                                        Convenient Tax Information
                                        Doing the tax return is simplified because each year the fund distributes a Form 1099
                                        explaining the taxability of distributions. The investor is told how much comes from each
                                        source. It even instructs the investor where to put each number on the tax return.


                                        Combination Privilege
                                        A mutual fund company frequently offers more than one fund and refers to these multiple
                                        offerings as its family of funds. An investor seeking a reduced sales charge may be allowed
                                        to combine separate investments in two or more funds within the same family to reach a
                                        breakpoint.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   Joe Smith has invested $15,000 in the ACE Growth Fund for retirement and $10,000
                                                   in the ACE Income Fund for his children’s education. The sponsor may view the two
                                                   separate expenditures as one investment totaling $25,000 when calculating the sales
                                                   charge.


                                        Exchanges Within a Family of Funds
                                        Many investment companies offer the exchange or conversion privilege within their families
                                        of funds. Exchange privileges allow an investor to convert an investment in one fund for an
                                        equal investment in another fund in the same family at NAV without incurring an additional
                                        sales charge. For example, those who started investing when in their 30s or 40s by placing
                                        their money into an aggressive growth fund might consider moving into something more
                                        conservative when they reached their 50s. Once they hit their 60s and 70s, they would want
                                        to have a greater percentage of their money in income funds. By staying in the same family of
                                        funds and using the exchange or conversion privilege, all of these changes could be made free
                                        of sales loads.

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   Any exchange of funds is considered a sale for tax purposes. Any gains or losses are
                                                   fully reportable at the time of the exchange.


                                        Leveraged and Inverse Funds
                                        With 2x or 3x leverage, the investor’s potential gains are higher than other funds. Inverse
                                        funds allow the investor to essentially sell short the market or an indexed segment within the
                                        framework of a mutual fund.

                       UIT Benefits

                       Income
                       If the UIT is composed of debt securities, it will generally provide higher income than
                       a mutual fund with a similar portfolio. This is because there is one major fund expense
                       not shared with a UIT. Because the UIT does not have a portfolio manager, there is no
                       management fee.

                       A second benefit is the stability of the income. Because the portfolio is fixed, the income does
                       not fluctuate. This is particularly beneficial to those who live on the fixed income generated by
                       their portfolio.


                       Liquidity
                       While not traded in the secondary markets, the trustees are obligated to redeem units
                       tendered by investors at the NAV of the unit. This is similar to the redemption procedure for
                       mutual funds.


                       Rolling Over Proceeds
                       Whether a debt or an equity UIT, there is a date when the trust terminates. In most cases,
                       investors have the option of investing the proceeds into a new trust without charge.



                                                                                                                                 Unit 8
                       CEF Benefits
                       CEFs have all of the diversification and management benefits of open-end companies. Here
                       are some benefits CEFs have that mutual funds don’t have.


                       Exchange-Traded
                       There are a number of benefits that come along with being traded in the secondary markets.
                       Among them is the ability to buy shares on margin and sell shares short. As with any other
                       exchange-traded asset, there is intraday trading. That means you don’t have to buy or sell
                       based on the day’s close. Another is liquidity. Instead of the seven-day redemption rule for
                       mutual funds, proceeds from the sale of a CEF are available two business days after the trade.
                       In fact, there is a process—covered in Unit 17—where the proceeds could be available the
                       same day.


                       Pricing
                       We have discussed the fact that the price of CEFs is based on supply and demand. This can
                       result in the fund selling at a premium or discount from its NAV. Investors purchasing shares
                       of a CEF at a discount are getting the assets for less than liquidating value. A mutual fund can
                       never be purchased at a discount from its NAV.


                       Leverage
                       CEFs can issue debt securities. That borrowed money creates financial leverage which can
                       multiply gains.

                                        ETF Benefits

                                        Taxation
                                        Most ETFs are structured such that an investor only realizes a capital gain (or loss) upon the
                                        sale. Contrast that with a mutual fund where capital gains distributions are paid annually and
                                        taxed. As a RIC, at least 90% of the NII is distributed.


                                        Expense Ratio
                                        For those ETFs tracking an index, (the default assumption on the exam), the management fee
                                        is low. In addition, because the portfolio is only changed when the components in the index
                                        change, trading costs (commissions) are low.


                                        Portfolio Specificity
                                        The large and ever growing number of ETFs contain options for almost any niche an investor
                                        desires.


                                        Exchange-Traded
                                        The benefits of exchange-traded ETFs are the same as indicated previously for CEFs. There
                                        is one significant difference, though. Unlike the CEFs where the price can be well above or
                                        below NAV, ETFs rarely stray far from the NAV.


                                        Leveraged and Inverse ETFs
                                        Leveraged and inverse ETFs have the same benefits as their mutual fund “cousins,” but are
                                        ETFs instead.

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   Remember that an index ETF is different from an index mutual fund in the following
                                                   ways:
                                                      Intraday trading—Investors do not have to wait until the end of a trading day to
                                                       purchase or sell shares. ETF shares trade and are priced continuously throughout
                                                       the day, making it easier for investors to react to market changes.
                                                      Margin eligibility—Index ETF shares can be purchased on margin, subject to the
                                                       same terms that apply to common stock.
                                                      Short selling—Index ETFs can be sold short at any time during trading hours.

                                        Introduction
                                        No investment is completely free of risk. Investment companies, for all of their benefits,
                                        do have risks. The amount of risk, obviously, depends on the investment objectives and the
                                        methods used to reach them. It is critical that the financial professional match the risk level




Series_7_2E.indb 216                                                                                                                    11/19/2021 7:52:50 PM

                       of the investment to the risk tolerance of the investor. Most of the risks are common to all
                       investment companies. We will describe those for mutual funds. Where there is something
                       different for another investment company, that will be listed.


                       Mutual Fund Risks

                       Market Risk
                       Even with the benefits offered by diversification and professional management, market prices
                       do fluctuate. Equity funds have market risk. As will be covered in detail in Unit 14, a risk
                       with equity conditions is that economic conditions beyond the control of the individual
                       company can cause stock prices to fall.


                       Interest Rate Risk
                       Income-oriented funds, especially bond funds, may be subject to interest rate risk. As we have
                       covered several times, when interest rates rise, bond prices fall. Unlike an individual bond that
                       ultimately repays principal at maturity, a bond fund doesn’t have a maturity date. The only
                       mutual fund that generally does not fluctuate in price is the money market fund, but there is a
                       trade-off in lack of growth and low income. Not only that, but the income of a money market
                       fund will vary, unlike that of a bank CD, which is fixed and insured by the FDIC.


                       Net Redemptions
                       Net redemptions is a risk unique to open-end investment companies (mutual funds).                         Unit 8
                       Sometimes, particularly during declining markets, there is an excess of shareholder
                       redemptions over new share purchases. This is known as net redemptions. When that occurs,
                       the portfolio manager is put in the difficult position of having to decide which assets to
                       liquidate when prices are falling. A fund suffering with net redemptions is probably not going
                       to deliver your clients the performance they are seeking.

                       As we learned in Lesson 8.2, open-end investment companies cannot issue bonds. However,
                       there is an option available to many funds for use during periods of net redemptions. That
                       option is short-term borrowing from banks. This occurs most often when redemption requests
                       exceed new purchases and the portfolio manager does not want to sell portfolio assets to raise
                       the money to meet those redemptions. There are limits on the amount that may be borrowed,
                       but we don’t expect those to be tested.


                       Expense Risk
                       There is also expense risk. Frequently, a fund may temporarily reduce a fee. It will notify
                       investors when that reduction has ended, but many investors don’t take the time to read the
                       fine print. One must carefully analyze all of the costs involved. These include
                        sales charges, 12b-1 fees, and possible redemption fees;
                        management fees (probably the largest expense on an ongoing basis); and
                        tax efficiency, as the investor has no control over the manager’s timing of purchases and
                         sales.

                                        Tenure Risk
                                        One of the basic tenets of communicating about securities is that past performance is
                                        no assurance of future results. That said, more often than not, a fund manager who has
                                        outperformed her peers seems to continue to enjoy better success. As we will learn in the next
                                        lesson, the contract of the fund manager has to be renewed every year. Sometimes, a successful
                                        manager gets a better offer elsewhere and leaves. That could happen shortly after you’ve made
                                        a large investment in the fund. The replacement might not have the same skills.


                                        UIT Risks

                                        Market Risk
                                        Equity UITs have market risk like any equity security. However, there is a unique situation
                                        with UITs. Remember, there is no ongoing management and the portfolio is fixed. That
                                        means there is no way for the trust to get off a sinking ship when it is obvious that one or
                                        several of the stocks in the portfolio are losing money.


                                        Interest Rate Risk
                                        Bond UITs have a similar problem as equity UITs. The nature of the fixed portfolio creates
                                        a difficult position for investors when interest rates are rising. In a bond mutual fund, the
                                        continuous inflow of new money allows the fund managers to purchase the new higher yield
                                        bonds. In a UIT, that can’t be done.


                                        CEF Risks

                                        Pricing Risk
                                        As we have stated many times, the price of closed-end shares is determined by supply and
                                        demand. An investor might purchase the shares at a premium over the NAV. It is beyond the
                                        scope of the exam to know why, but there are several reasons why the demand would be such
                                        that the shares would trade at a premium. For one, at a later time, the investor decides to sell
                                        the shares and now, again for reasons beyond the test, the shares are selling at a discount. Or,
                                        perhaps the NAV has gone up, but buying at a premium and selling at a discount has resulted
                                        in a loss to the investor.

                                        This cannot happen with mutual funds or UITs because they are always redeemed at NAV. It
                                        is not likely with ETFs because they always trade very close to the NAV.


                                        Leverage Risk
                                        CEF’s can issue bonds. That borrowed money can help increase returns when the manager
                                        guesses correctly. But, as with any leverage, if the market moves the wrong way, the losses are
                                        magnified.

                         ETF Risks

                         Index Risk
                         This is a risk that is conceptually similar to the fixed portfolio risk of a UIT. Remember, the
                         portfolio mimics the composition of the specified index. If one or more of the securities in
                         that index underperforms, the ETF is stuck with it until the index removes the security. This
                         is a major risk to passive investing.


                         Tracking Risk
                         It is virtually impossible to have performance equal to (and never better than) the index. The
                         index itself has no expenses. There are no trading commissions, no filings with regulatory
                         agencies, no legal expenses, and so forth. All other things equal, you would probably want to
                         recommend the ETF with the highest tracking reliability.

                         company securities.



                         The Investment Company Act of 1940
                                                                                                                                    Unit 8
                         Introduction
                         Most of the regulatory requirements for investment companies are found in this federal law.
                         Many of the rules have been covered where relevant to the material being discussed. Here are
                         other provisions that might be tested.


                         Board of Directors (BOD)
                         In general, management investment companies, (open-end and closed-end) cannot have a
                         BOD that consists of more than 60% of persons who meet the definition of interested persons
                         of the investment company.

                                   TAKE NOTE
                                   Another way of stating that no more than 60% of the directors may be interested
                                   persons is to say that at least 40% must be noninterested, that is, “outside” directors.
                                   These are individuals who have no connection to the fund other than a position on the
                                   board (and maybe owning some shares of the fund as would any investor).Typically
                                   outside directors are academics or prominent community members.

                                        Prohibited Activities
                                        Open-end investment companies are prohibited from engaging in several activities. Mutual
                                        funds may not
                                         purchase any security on margin;
                                         participate on a joint basis in any trading account in securities (i.e., an investment
                                          company cannot have a joint account with someone else);
                                         sell any security short; or
                                         acquire more than 3% of the outstanding voting securities of another investment
                                          company.

                                        There are exceptions to these prohibitions, but, for the purposes of the exam, you may
                                        disregard any exceptions.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   18. The Investment Company Act of 1940 prohibits registered open-end investment
                                                       companies from engaging in any of the following practices except
                                                        A. issuing common stock.
                                                        B. selling short or purchasing securities for the company’s portfolio on margin.
                                                        C. owning more than 3% of the outstanding voting securities of another
                                                             investment company.
                                                        D. opening a joint account with another investment company.
                                                       Answer: A. The one thing that all open-end investment companies must do is
                                                       issue common stock. That is the form of ownership. All of the other activities are
                                                       prohibited.


                                        Changes in Investment Policy
                                        In order for an investment company’s board to make fundamental investment policy changes,
                                        a majority vote of the outstanding voting stock is required. Examples of fundamental changes
                                        would include
                                         a change in subclassification, such as from an open-end to a closed-end company or from
                                          a diversified to a nondiversified company;
                                         deviation from any fundamental policy in its registration statement, including a change in
                                          investment objective; and
                                         changing the nature of its business so as to cease to be an investment company.
                                        In other words, because the investment company is supposed to function for the benefit of the
                                        shareholders, any of these changes would require the vote of a majority of the shareholders.


                                        Size of Investment Companies
                                        No registered investment company is permitted to make a public offering of securities unless
                                        it has a net worth of at least $100,000.

                       Investment Advisory and Underwriter Contracts
                       A majority vote of the shareholders must approve the contract between the investment
                       company and its investment adviser and the contract with its principal underwriter. These
                       contracts must be in writing and provide that the contract
                        precisely describes all compensation to be paid;
                        will be approved at least annually by the BOD or by majority vote of the shareholders if it
                         is to be renewed after the first two years; and
                        provides that it may be terminated at any time, without penalty, by the BOD or by
                         majority vote of the shareholders on not more than 60 days’ written notice to the
                         investment adviser.

                       In addition, it is unlawful for any registered investment company to enter into or renew any
                       contract with an investment adviser or principal underwriter unless the terms have been
                       approved by majority vote of directors who are not parties to such contract as affiliated
                       persons (i.e., directors who are not affiliated with the adviser or the underwriter, who in the
                       aggregate must comprise at least 40% of the directors).

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 The effect of this final paragraph is that no advisory contract, whether initial or
                                 renewal, may take effect without approval of the noninterested members of the board.


                       Custodian
                       It is required that every registered investment company keeps its assets with a custodian. In
                       most cases, that custodian is a bank, hence the common use of the term custodian bank.                    Unit 8
                       Although the Investment Company Act of 1940 specifies certain financial requirements for
                       that bank, it does not require that the bank have FDIC coverage. Alternatively, the investment
                       company may use a broker-dealer that is a member firm of a national securities exchange.


                       Periodic and Other Reports
                       All investment companies must file annual financial reports with the SEC. These reports
                       contain an audited balance sheet and income statement. In addition, shareholders must be
                       sent financial information semiannually. In keeping with current technology, these reports
                       may be delivered electronically.

                       Knowing what is prohibited and what is required is often tested on the exam. Here are two
                       examples expressing ideas that are likely to be tested:

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 19. Which of the following statements correctly expresses requirements under the
                                     Investment Company Act of 1940?
                                       A. A registered open-end investment company using a bank as custodian must
                                           choose one that has FDIC coverage.
                                       B. Shareholders must receive financial reports from the fund at least annually.
                                       C. No investment advisory contract may be entered into that does not provide for
                                           termination with no more than 60 days’ notice in writing.
                                       D. No open-end investment company may offer shares to the public unless the
                                           fund has capital of at least $1 million.

                                                       Answer: C. The Investment Company Act of 1940 requires that all advisory contracts
                                                       contain a provision that the contract may be terminated upon no more than 60
                                                       days’ notice in writing. There is no requirement that the custodian bank have FDIC
                                                       insurance. Shareholders must receive financial reports at least semiannually. The
                                                       minimum capitalization of an investment company offering shares to the public is
                                                       $100,000.


                                        FINRA Rules
                                        Most of the relevant information is found in FINRA Rule 2341. Following are the most
                                        testable portions of the rule that have not previously been covered.


                                        Selling Dividends
                                        Selling dividends is the prohibited practice of inducing customers to buy mutual fund shares
                                        by implying that an upcoming distribution will benefit them. What is usually not explained is
                                        that the NAV of the fund will drop by the amount of the dividend.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   LMN Income Fund has declared a dividend of $0.50. A registered representative
                                                   encourages a client to buy now. The rep explains that the current POP is about $10
                                                   per share (remember—forward pricing means we don’t know exactly what we paid
                                                   until after the trade). “This means you are going to pay $10 and get back a dividend of
                                                   50 cents. That is like an immediate 5% return on your money.” What is not explained
                                                   is that the fund’s NAV will drop by those 50 cents. There is no benefit and, in fact, the
                                                   dividend is taxable. It really would have been better to wait and buy the fund for a
                                                   lower price and not have a taxable dividend.


                                        Sales Agreement
                                        In order for a member firm and its representatives to be able to sell a particular investment
                                        company security, the firm must have a written sales agreement with the investment company.

                                        The agreement says that no member firm may purchase mutual fund shares from a client
                                        at a price lower than the NAV next quoted for the shares. That would be an unfair business
                                        practice because the client can redeem at NAV directly from the fund.

                                        Another part of the agreement is designed to keep broker-dealers from receiving compensation
                                        on the sale of shares that are quickly redeemed. If any fund shares are sent in for redemption
                                        to the issuer within seven business days after the initial transaction date, the member will
                                        refund to the underwriter the full concession allowed to the firm on the origi­nal sale.


                                        Anti-Reciprocal Rule (FINRA Rule 2341; MSRB Rule G-31)
                                        An investment company’s choice of a broker-dealer to handle portfolio transactions and
                                        investments must be based on the broker-dealer’s capabilities. Any transactions must be justi­
                                        fied on the basis of the value and quality of the brokerage services rendered, not on the basis
                                        of the dollar amount of sales of the investment company shares by that broker-dealer.

                                        A member’s retail sales of investment company shares must depend on suitability—which
                                        funds best fit the objectives of the specific clients involved. Funds should not be selected on
                                        the basis of additional brokerage commissions generated by fund portfolio transactions. In

                                                                                    Unit 8   Investment Companies     223


                       fact, a member firm may not knowingly do business with a fund it knows allocates portfolio
                       transac­tion business on the basis of fund share sales.

                       To enforce the earlier principle, FINRA has issued the following interpretations. With respect
                       to member retail sales of investment company shares, the member may not
                        give sales personnel an incentive or additional compensation based on the amount of
                         brokerage commissions received from any investment company (including bonuses,
                         preferred compensation lists, sales incentive campaigns, and contests based on brokerage
                         commissions);
                        recommend specific investment companies to sales personnel or establish recommended,
                         selected, or preferred lists if those companies are chosen on the basis of brokerage
                         commis­sions received or expected;
                        grant a salesperson participation in the brokerage commission generated by a portfolio
                         transaction if participation is identified with the sale of shares of the investment company;
                         or
                        use sales of shares of an investment company in negotiating the amount of brokerage
                         com­missions to be paid on a portfolio transaction.


                       Noncash Compensation
                       In the retail distribution of investment company shares, mutual fund distributors may, in
                       general, pay commissions and concessions to members only in the form of cash. There are
                       exceptions to this, which may not be preconditioned on achievement of a sales target. Gifts
                       of material value not to exceed $100 per person per year may be given, as well as occasional

                       educational meet­ing may also be sponsored, provided records are kept of expenditures, the
                       venue is in an appro­priate—not an exotic—location, associated persons receive permission
                       from their employers to attend the meeting, and the expenses of any guests they may bring
                       are not reimbursed. However, if an approved meeting, there is no problem having the sponsor
                       directly reimburse the attendee for travel expenses incurred in conjunction with attending the
                       seminar.

                       This same principle applies when the noncash compensation is from the member firm to its
                       sales personnel. Sales incentives and rewards must not favor the sale of one fund over another
                       based on the amount of compensation received by the member. This would create a conflict
                       of interest and make it difficult for the registered representative to honestly make the most
                       suitable recommendations.


                       The Gifts Rule
                       Don’t confuse the preceding discussion with FINRA Rule 3220 (Influencing or Rewarding
                       Employees of Others) and MSRB Rule G-20. Better known as the Gifts Rule, it prohibits
                       any member or person associated with a member, directly or indirectly, from giving anything
                       of value in excess of $100 per year to any person where such payment is in relation to the
                       business of the recipient’s employer. There is no limit on the gifts or compensation that may
                       be given to employees, as long as it isn’t designed to reward or influence the sale of specific
                       products.

              INTRODUCTION
                         Many products offered by life insurance companies are not securities. Most people have some
                         form of life insurance, whether provided by their employer, personally owned, or both. The
                         exam focuses on those contracts that are defined as securities. This unit will deal with variable
                         annuities and variable life insurance.


              LESSON 9.1: VARIABLE PRODUCTS OF INSURANCE COMPANIES

                         LO 9.a Define variable products and their characteristics.



                         Annuities
                         An annuity is generally a contract between an individual and a life insurance company, usually
                         purchased for retirement income. An investor, the annuitant, pays the premium in one lump
                         sum or in periodic payments. At a future date, the annuitant can either elect to surrender the
                         policy and receive a lump-sum payout or begin receiving regular income distributions that will
                         continue for life.

                                       Because all earnings are tax-deferred, many individuals looking to accumulate additional
                                       funds for retirement find annuities to be a valuable tool. Unlike IRAs and qualified retirement
                                       plans (covered in Unit 1) which limit the amount that can be contributed, there is no legal
                                       limit to the amount that can be invested in an annuity (the insurance company may place a
                                       limit that it will accept, generally in the range of $1—$3 million).

                                       Annuity contracts are classified into two major types (depending on the guarantees offered):
                                        Fixed annuities
                                        Variable annuities


                                       Fixed Annuities
                                       Fixed annuities are not securities. We are covering them because many of the exam questions
                                       about variable annuities (a security) compare the two products. A fixed annuity guarantees
                                       a fixed rate of return. When the individual elects to begin receiving income, the payout is
                                       determined by the account’s value and the annuitant’s life expectancy based on mortality
                                       tables. A fixed annuity payout remains fixed throughout the annuitant’s life.

                                                  TAKE NOTE
                                                  Because the insurance company guarantees the return and the annuitant bears no
                                                  risk, a fixed annuity is an insurance product and not a security. A salesperson must
                                                  have a life insurance license to sell fixed annuities but does not need to be securities
                                                  licensed.
                                       Although principal and interest are not at risk, a fixed annuity risks loss of purchasing power
                                       because of inflation.

                                                  EXAMPLE
                                                  An individual who annuitized a contract in 1990 may have been guaranteed a monthly
                                                  payout of $1,800. Decades later, this amount may prove insufficient to cover living
                                                  expenses.


                                       Variable Annuities
                                       Instead of purchase payments being directed to the insurance company’s general account,
                                       money deposited in a variable annuity is directed into one or more subaccounts of the
                                       company’s separate account. The separate account comprises various subaccounts that behave
                                       like mutual funds (we just can’t call them mutual funds). These accounts will have a variety of
                                       investment objectives to choose from, such as growth, income, and growth and income. The
                                       returns in the separate account are not guaranteed, and therefore a loss of principal is possible.

                                       Because the separate account is registered as an investment company, as required by the
                                       Securities Act of 1933, a prospectus must be delivered prior to or concurrent with the sale
                                       (Unit 20).

                                       Although the options include money market securities and bonds, purchase payments are
                                       most often invested in a stock portfolio, which has a better chance of keeping pace with
                                       inflation than fixed-income investments.

                                       The greater potential gain of a variable annuity involves more potential risk than a fixed
                                       annuity because it invests in securities rather than accepting the insurance company’s
                                       guarantees. Payouts may vary considerably because an annuity unit’s worth fluctuates with the
                                       value of the selected subaccount(s).

                                       The following chart covers the major differences between the two products.

                                       Although annuitants of variable annuities can choose a guaranteed monthly income for life,
                                       the amount of monthly income received is dependent on the performance of the separate
                                       account. If the performance is better than assumed, the next month’s payment is higher. If it is
                                       less than assumed, the next month’s payment will decrease.

                                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  1.   The key difference between a fixed annuity and a variable annuity is that the fixed
                                                       annuity
                                                        A. offers a guaranteed return.
                                                        B. offers a monthly payment that may vary in amount.
                                                        C. will always pay out more money than a variable annuity.
                                                        D. attempts to offer protection to the annuitant from inflation risk.
                                                       Answer: A. If an annuity is fixed, it means the return to the investor is guaranteed.
                                                       With a variable annuity, there are no guarantees as to the amount of return. It is
                                                       the variable annuity whose annuity payment will vary and, because of the growth
                                                       opportunity, offers potential inflation protection.

                                        Separate Account
                                        The contributions that investors make to a variable annuity are kept in a separate account
                                        from the insurance company’s general funds. Investors determine in which of the subaccounts
                                        their money will be placed. Some insurance company separate accounts offer 25, 30, or even
                                        more subaccounts, from the most aggressive to the most conservative.

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   The Investment Company Act of 1940 does not include variable annuities in its
                                                   definition of investment companies. On the other hand, the separate account is. Most
                                                   often, it is a unit investment trust (UIT).


                                        Guaranteed Death Benefit
                                        Most variable annuities offer an option stating that if the investor dies during the
                                        accumulation period, the beneficiary will receive the greater of the current value of the
                                        account or the amount invested. Therefore, the estate is assured of getting back at least the
                                        original investment.


                                        Life Insurance
                                        Life insurance provides a death benefit to a named beneficiary or beneficiaries upon the death
                                        of the insured. There are many variations of life insurance, each serving different needs. We
                                        will review these policies and focus on one considered a security. Regardless of the type of
                                        insurance, the premium for the policy is calculated according to the insured’s health, age, and
                                        sex, as well as the policy’s face amount at issue.

                                        Whole life insurance is designed to last until at least age 100 or the death of the insured,
                                        whichever occurs first. These policies also accrue cash value that may be borrowed for living
                                        needs. An insurance license is required to be able to sell life insurance. Whole life insurance is
                                        not a security and is not sold as an investment.

                                        Term life insurance is protection for a specified period, hence the description term. Term
                                        insurance provides pure protection and is the least expensive form of life insurance. Unlike
                                        whole life, term does not build cash values. If the policy is surrendered before death or is not
                                        renewed, there is nothing but an expired policy.


                                        Variable Life Insurance
                                        Variable life insurance has a fixed, scheduled premium but differs from whole life insurance
                                        in that the premiums paid are split; part of the premium is placed in the general assets of the
                                        insurance company. These general assets are used to guarantee a minimum death benefit. The
                                        balance of the premium is placed in the separate account and represents the cash value of the
                                        policy. Because the cash value is invested in the separate account, which fluctuates in value,
                                        its cash value is not guaranteed. The policy’s death benefit may increase above the minimum
                                        guaranteed amount as a result of investment results, but may never fall below the minimum
                                        (as long as premiums are paid).

                                        Although the value of the separate account is calculated daily, the policyholder’s cash value in
                                        a variable life contract is reported monthly.

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 Because a variable life insurance policy has a minimum death benefit, the premiums
                                 necessary to fund this part of the death benefit are held in the insurer’s general
                                 account. Any policy benefit that is guaranteed is invested in the insurer’s general
                                 account.
                                 Any premium above what is necessary to pay for the minimum death benefit is
                                 invested in the separate account. This portion of the premium is subject to investment
                                 risk and variable life insurance and therefore is also defined as a security. As long as
                                 premiums are paid, the policy remains in force, even if the separate accounts lose
                                 money every year.
                                 Once the premium has been determined and the expenses have been deducted, the
                                 net premium is invested in subaccounts of the separate account. Just as with variable
                                 annuities, there are number of subaccounts to choose from. Those include objectives
                                 such as
                                     growth,
                                     income,
                                     balanced,
                                     index or indices, and
                                     money market.


                       Assumed Interest Rate (AIR) and Variable Death Benefits
                       The death benefit payable under a variable life insurance policy is adjusted on an annual basis
                       and can increase or decrease based on the performance of the separate account compared with
                       an assumed interest rate (AIR). One of the benefits of variable life insurance is that the death
                       benefit can adjust upward and possibly keep pace with inflation.

                       This AIR is the minimum rate of return necessary to provide the level death benefit. It is
                       determined by the insurance company’s actuaries and is stated in the policy contract. It is
                       simply a target, not a projection.

                       If the separate account returns are greater than the AIR, these extra earnings are reflected in an
                       increase in death benefit and cash value. If the separate account returns equal the AIR, actual
                       earnings meet estimated expenses, resulting in no change in the death benefit. Should the
                       separate account returns be less than the AIR, the contract’s death benefit will decrease. It is            Unit 9
                       important to note that it will never fall below the amount guaranteed at issue.

                       In Lesson 9.3, we are going to discuss the AIR and its effect on the valuation of a variable
                       annuity.

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 The variable death benefit is adjusted annually. Contrast this with the monthly
                                 valuation of the cash value. Some students have reported they remember this because
                                 they think about their cash all the time, but don’t want to be continuously reminded
                                 about dying.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   The AIR has no effect on cash value accumulation in a variable life policy. The cash
                                                   value will grow whenever the separate account has positive performance. The
                                                   AIR does, however, affect the death benefit. Just remember the rules for variable
                                                   annuities. The rules for the death benefits are analogous:
                                                       If the separate account performance for the year is greater than the AIR, the death
                                                        benefit will increase.
                                                       If the separate account performance for the year is equal to the AIR, the death
                                                        benefit will stay the same.
                                                       If the separate account performance for the year is less than the AIR, the death
                                                        benefit will decrease (but never below the policy’s face amount).


           LESSON 9.2: ANNUITY PURCHASE AND SETTLEMENT OPTIONS

                                        LO 9.b Compare the different purchase and settlement options for annuities.



                                        Purchasing Annuities
                                        Insurance companies offer a number of purchase arrangements for annuities. Aggregate
                                        fees include not only sales charges on the front end, but also those levied upon surrender,
                                        commonly called conditional deferred sales loads. In many cases, there is no-load to purchase,
                                        but if surrender—other than through annuitization—occurs during the early years of the
                                        contract, the charges can be significant.

                                        It is important to note the key point of FINRA Rule 2320 that deals with variable annuities
                                        sold by FINRA members. Under this rule, there is no maximum sales charge limitation in the
                                        sale of variable annuities. The only requirement is that the sales charge must be reasonable.

                                        An investor is offered a number of options when purchasing an annuity. Payments to the
                                        insurance company can be made either with a single lump-sum payment or periodically on a
                                        monthly, quarterly, or annual basis.

                                        A single premium deferred annuity is purchased with a lump sum, but payment of benefits is
                                        delayed until a later date selected by the annuitant.

                                        A periodic payment deferred annuity allows investments over time. Benefit payments for
                                        this type of annuity are always deferred until a later date selected by the annuitant.

                                        An immediate annuity is purchased with a lump sum, and the payout of benefits usually
                                        commences within 60 days.

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   There is no such thing as a periodic payment immediate annuity.


                                        Bonus Annuities
                                        It is not uncommon for variable annuities to offer a bonus on top of the investor’s initial
                                        contribution. For example, investing $60,000 into a single premium annuity with a 5%
                                        bonus would result in an account balance of $63,000. Usually, bonus annuities have surrender




Series_7_2E.indb 230                                                                                                                       11/19/2021 7:52:52 PM
                                                                                 Unit 9   Insurance Company Products     231


                       charges lasting longer than those without the bonus. Recommendations to customers must
                       disclose the additional costs, as well as the benefits of the bonus.

                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                  2.   Variable annuities tend to be more difficult for customers to understand than many
                                       other investments. It is therefore incumbent upon the registered representative to
                                       be able to explain the many different terms and concepts used. From the following,
                                       select the true statement.
                                        A. Rather than mandating a maximum sales charge, FINRA requires that any load
                                             be reasonable.
                                        B. When investing in a variable annuity, the customer should expect to pay both
                                             a sales charge on the purchase (front-end load) and a surrender charge when
                                             liquidating (back-end load).
                                        C. The advantages of purchasing a bonus annuity is that the investor gets a head
                                             start up front and reduces the period during which surrender charges will
                                             apply.
                                        D. An investor wishing to make periodic investments into the annuity should
                                             select the periodic payment immediate annuity option.
                                       Answer: A. Unlike mutual funds with their 8.5% maximum sales load, FINRA’s only
                                       requirement for variable annuities is that the load be reasonable. Most variable
                                       annuities sold today are without a front-end load while having significant back-end
                                       loads as conditional deferred sales charges (CDSC). Bonus annuities do jump start
                                       the investment but at the expense of a longer surrender period. The surrender charge
                                       period on some bonus annuities can run for 15 years or longer. There is no logic
                                       to putting money in while at the same time taking it out as would happen with a
                                       periodic payment immediate annuity.


                       Settlement Options
                       Although there are other choices, the exam’s focus is on the options available to those who
                       choose to annuitize. When we discuss taxation later in this unit, we will cover the option
                       surrendering the contract. We will also cover the death benefit available should the contract
                       holder die before receiving benefits.

                       Annuitants wishing to receive scheduled payments for life may annuitize. In that case, a
                       payout option must be selected. Annuity payout options, in order from largest monthly
                       payout to smallest monthly payout, follow:                                                                  Unit 9
                        Life annuity (also known as straight life or life only)
                        Life annuity with period certain
                        Joint life with last survivor annuity
                        Unit refund option
                       This is a contractual obligation that is entered into, and once annuitized, the decision is final.


                       Life Annuity/Straight Life
                       If an annuitant selects the life income option, the insurance company will pay the annuitant
                       for life. When the annuitant dies, there are no continuing payments to a beneficiary. Money
                       remaining in the account reverts to the insurer. Because the option places the risk of dying too
                       soon on the annuitant, it represents the largest monthly check an annuitant could receive for
                       the rest of the annuitant’s life. (The insurance company has no further obligation at death.)

                                                   The life annuity probably would not have been a good choice if the annuitant died
                                                   after receiving only one month’s payment. With the straight life option, all money
                                                   accumulated that was not paid out at the time of the annuitant’s death would belong
                                                   to the insurer.


                                        Life Annuity With Period Certain
                                        The life annuity with period certain option is a little less risky because it allows for payments
                                        to a beneficiary. To guarantee that a minimum number of payments are made even if the
                                        annuitant dies, this option can be chosen. The contract will specifically allow the choice of
                                        a period of 10 or 20 years, for instance. The length of the period certain is a choice that is
                                        made when a payout option is selected. The annuitant is guaranteed monthly income for life
                                        with this option, but if death occurs within the period certain, a named beneficiary receives
                                        payments for the remainder of the period. Because there is a named beneficiary for the
                                        period certain, the size of this check will be smaller than a straight life option. (The insurance
                                        company is obligated to pay the named beneficiary an income if death occurs during the
                                        period certain.)

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   To illustrate the life annuity with period certain option, assume a client selects a
                                                   life annuity with a 10-year period certain. If the annuitant lives to be 150 years old,
                                                   annuity payments are still made by the insurer. But, if the annuitant dies after receiving
                                                   payments for two years, the beneficiary will receive payments for eight more years.


                                        Joint Life With Last Survivor Annuity
                                        The joint life with last survivor option guarantees payments over two lives. It is often used for
                                        spouses. Because the insurance company is obligated to pay a check over two lifetimes, this
                                        check will be smaller than a life with period certain option.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   If the husband were to die first, the wife would continue to receive payments as long
                                                   as she lives. If the wife were to die first, the husband would receive payments as long
                                                   as he lives. Typically, the payment amount is reduced for the survivor.


                                        Unit Refund Option
                                        If the annuitant chooses the unit refund option, a minimum number of payments are made
                                        upon retirement. If value remains in the account after the death of the annuitant, it is payable
                                        in a lump sum to the annuitant’s beneficiary. This option may be added as a rider to one of
                                        the others.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   The unit refund option is the only lifetime annuitization option that guarantees all of
                                                   the money in the contract will be distributed. If unit refund is chosen for a $100,000
                                                   contract, the insurance company guarantees that a minimum of $100,000 will be
                                                   distributed, and also guarantees a monthly check for life. Therefore, more than
                                                   $100,000 may be distributed, but never less. Unit refund is sometimes offered as a
                                                   rider.

                                    For test purposes, this option represents the smallest check a person could receive for
                                    the rest of her life.

                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                    3.   Phil and Clarissa are thinking about selecting a settlement option for their variable
                                         annuity. If their objective is to have the annuity provide income until both of them are
                                         deceased, which of the following settlement options will best meet their needs?
                                          A. Straight life annuity
                                          B. Joint and survivor annuity
                                          C. Installment refund annuity
                                          D. Life annuity with period certain
                                         Answer: B. The joint and survivor annuity allows the couple to have the annuity
                                         provide income until both of them are deceased. The payment will be lower than
                                         on a straight life annuity because two lives are involved rather than one— there
                                         will be more risk for the insurance company but less risk for the annuitants. For a
                                         given purchase price, a straight life annuity generally provides the highest monthly
                                         payment amount because the annuity provides no payments beyond the annuitant’s
                                         life. It is the old rule of the risk reward relationship—the more risk you take, the higher
                                         the reward.


              LESSON 9.3: VALUING A VARIABLE ANNUITY
                          LO 9.c Define the terms used to value a variable annuity.



                          Introduction
                          A variable annuity has two distinct phases. The growth phase is its accumulation phase, while
                          the payout phase is its annuity phase. A contract owner’s interest in the separate account is
                          known as either accumulation units or annuity units, depending on the contract phase.


                          Accumulation Phase
                          The pay-in period for a deferred annuity is known as the accumulation stage (there is no
                          accumulation period for an immediate annuity). During the accumulation stage of an
                          annuity contract, the contract terms are flexible. An investor who misses a periodic payment is                Unit 9
                          in no danger of forfeiting the preceding contributions.

                          The contract holder can terminate the contract at any time during the accumulation stage,
                          although the contract holder is likely to incur surrender charges on amounts withdrawn in the
                          first five to 10 years after issuance of the contract.


                          Accumulation Units
                          An accumulation unit is an accounting measure that represents an investor’s share of
                          ownership in the separate account. An accumulation unit’s value is determined in the same
                          way as the value of mutual fund shares. The unit value changes with the value of the securities
                          held in the separate account. The accumulation unit has a NAV.

                          The names of various purchase options are quite descriptive of how they operate and should
                          not be difficult to follow. Just to be sure, let’s try the following question.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   4.   Insurance companies selling annuities offer a variety of purchase options to owners.
                                                        Which of the following definitions regarding these annuity options is not true?
                                                          A. Accumulation annuity—an annuity that allows the investor to accumulate
                                                              funds in a separate account before investment in an annuity.
                                                          B. Single premium deferred annuity—an annuity with a lump-sum investment,
                                                              with payment of benefits deferred until the annuitant elects to receive them.
                                                          C. Periodic payment deferred annuity—allows a person to make periodic
                                                              payments over time. The contract holder can invest money on a monthly,
                                                              quarterly, or annual basis.
                                                          D. Immediate annuity—allows an investor to deposit a lump sum with the
                                                              insurance company. Payout of the annuitant’s benefits starts immediately,
                                                              usually within 60 days.
                                                        Answer: A. Accumulation does not refer to a purchase option. The pay-in period for
                                                        an annuity is known as the accumulation stage. A single premium deferred annuity is
                                                        an annuity with a lump-sum investment, with payment of benefits deferred until the
                                                        annuitant elects to receive them. Periodic payment deferred annuities allow a person
                                                        to make periodic payments over time. Immediate annuities allow an investor to
                                                        deposit a lump sum with the insurance company payout of the annuitant’s benefits
                                                        starting immediately, usually within 60 days.


                                        Annuity Units
                                        When a variable annuity contract is annuitized, accumulation units are exchanged for annuity
                                        units. An annuity unit is a measure of value used only during an annuitized contract’s
                                        payout period. It is an accounting measure, that determines the amount of each payment to
                                        the annuitant during the payout period. The number of annuity units is a key factor used to
                                        calculate the payout each month.

           Figure 9.2: Annuitization
            Accumulation phase                                        Annuity phase

              Accumulation units                                      Annuity units

                                        The number of annuity units is calculated when an owner annuitizes the contract. The
                                        number of annuity units liquidated each month does not change—it is fixed at the time of
                                        annuitizing based on the value of the contract when the payout period begins and on other
                                        variables (such as the payout option selected, the individual’s age and sex, and AIR). The
                                        payment the annuitant will receive each month varies because each unit’s value fluctuates with
                                        the separate account portfolio’s value. This is, after all, a variable annuity.


                                        Assumed Interest Rate (AIR)
                                        The assumed interest rate (AIR) is a basis for determining distributions from a variable
                                        annuity. The rate, usually estimated conservatively, provides an earnings target for the separate
                                        account. Simply, if the actual earnings exceed the AIR, the annuity payments increase; if they
                                        fall short of the AIR, the payments decrease. Returns equaling the AIR keep the payments level.

                                        The actuarial department of the insurance company determines the initial value for the
                                        annuity units and the amount of the first month’s annuity payment. At this time, an AIR is
                                        established. The AIR is a conservative projection of the performance of the separate account
                                        over the estimated life of the contract.

                                                                                   Unit 9   Insurance Company Products        235


                       The value of an annuity unit and the annuitant’s subsequent monthly income will vary,
                       depending on separate account performance as compared to the AIR. To determine whether
                       the monthly payment will increase, decrease, or stay the same as the previous month, the
                       following rules apply:
                        If separate account performance is greater than the AIR, the following month’s payment is
                         more than this month’s.
                        If separate account performance is equal to the AIR, the following month’s payment stays
                         the same as this month’s.
                        If separate account performance is less than the AIR, the following month’s payment is
                         less than this month’s.

                       Many students have trouble catching on to this. Please try to follow this example.

                                 EXAMPLE
                                 Assume an AIR of 4% and that the actuaries have determined the first payment to be
                                 $1,000.
                                 Month 2’s separate account performance is 6%, greater than AIR, so the next check
                                 goes up.
                                 Month 3’s separate account performance is 4%, right at AIR. The next check received
                                 equals the last check received.
                                 Month 4’s separate account performance is 3%, which is below AIR; therefore the next
                                 check received will be less than the last check received.
                                 Month 5’s separate account performance is 3% again, which, although the same as
                                 month 4’s, is still below AIR. The next check is, therefore, less than that of the last.
                                 Month 6’s separate account performance is not shown, but if separate account
                                 performance is above the AIR of 4%, the next check will be more than $950; if it is
                                 below the AIR of 4%, the next check will be less than $950.

                                  AIR = 4%            Month 1     Month 2     Month 3 Month 4 Month 5 Month 6

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 Consider this: If AIR is 4% and the separate account always returns 4%, the check
                                 would never change.

                                 5.   An insurance company offering a variable annuity makes payments to annuitants
                                      on the 15th of each month. The contract has an AIR of 3%. In July of this year, the
                                      contract earned 4%. In August, the account earned 6%. If the contract earns 3% in
                                      September, the payments to annuitants in October will be
                                       A. greater than the payments in September.
                                       B. less than the payments in September.

           LESSON 9.4: TAXATION OF VARIABLE ANNUITIES

                                        LO 9.d Differentiate between the different kinds of tax treatment of variable
                                        annuities.



                                        Introduction
                                        One of the most distinctive features of variable annuities is their tax treatment. We must
                                        separate the tax treatment during accumulation from that of when the funds are withdrawn.


                                        Annuity Accumulation Stage
                                        All growth in the value of an accumulation unit is deferred until withdrawal. For example, a
                                        grandparent gives a newborn grandchild $10,000. That money is used for a single premium
                                        deferred annuity. If the account earned 7%, when that child turned 70, it would be worth
                                        over $1.1 million. During those 70 years, not a penny of tax would be due. Shortly, we will
                                        discuss the taxation when the money is taken out.

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   For exam purposes, all contributions to annuities are made with after-tax dollars,
                                                   unless the annuity is part of an employer-sponsored (qualified) retirement plan or
                                                   held in an IRA. Because there is no tax on the “way in,” the exam will concentrate on
                                                   taxation on the “way out.”


                                        Annuity Payout Stage
                                        There are three different taxable scenarios and we will consider them one at a time.

                                        On withdrawal, the amount exceeding the investor’s cost basis is taxed as ordinary income.


                                        Random Withdrawals
                                        Random withdrawals from annuity contracts are taxed under the last in, first out (LIFO)
                                        method. Earnings are presumed by the IRS to be the last monies to hit the account. The
                                        earnings are considered to be withdrawn first from the annuity and are taxable as ordinary
                                        income. After the withdrawal of all earnings, contributions representing cost basis may be
                                        withdrawn without tax. With nonqualified annuities, it is only the earnings that are taxed.
                                        Using our grandparent example above, when that 70-year-old withdraws any money from the
                                        annuity, all $1.1 million in excess of the original $10,000 is taxed as ordinary income.


                                        Lump-Sum Withdrawals
                                        Lump-sum withdrawals are taken by using the LIFO accounting method. This means that
                                        earnings are removed before contributions. If an investor receives a lump-sum withdrawal




Series_7_2E.indb 236                                                                                                                       11/19/2021 7:52:54 PM
                                                                                 Unit 9   Insurance Company Products     237


                       before age 59½, the earnings portion withdrawn is taxed as ordinary income and is subject to
                       an additional 10% tax penalty under most circumstances.

                       The penalty does not apply if the funds withdrawn before age 59½ are withdrawn because of
                       death or disability, or are part of a life income option plan with fixed payouts.

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 Remember, most variable annuities have the death benefit provision described earlier.
                                 As with any lump-sum withdrawal, everything above the cost basis is taxable at
                                 ordinary income rates. What is avoided is the 10% penalty if under 59½.

                                 EXAMPLE
                                 A contract with a $100,000 value consists of $40,000 in contributions and $60,000 in
                                 earnings. If the investor withdraws all $100,000 at once, the $60,000 in earnings is
                                 taxed as ordinary income and the $40,000 cost basis is returned tax-free. If the investor
                                 is at least 59½, there is no 10% tax penalty; if younger, the 10% tax penalty applies.
                                 However, the penalty only applies to the taxable portion ($60,000)—there is never a
                                 penalty tax on money that is not taxable. If the investor withdraws $10,000, (or any
                                 amount up to $60,000), under the LIFO rule, it is considered a withdrawal of earnings
                                 and will be taxed as ordinary income. There is never a capital gain with an annuity.

                                 TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                 Even when the distribution is from a nonqualified annuity, if it is made before the age
                                 of 59½, it is subject to the 10% additional tax (unless it meets one of the exceptions
                                 listed previously).
                                 Assume an annuity is nonqualified unless a question specifically states otherwise.
                                 When contributions are made with after-tax dollars, these already taxed dollars are
                                 considered the investor’s cost basis and are not taxed when withdrawn. The earnings
                                 in excess of the cost basis are taxed as ordinary income when withdrawn.
                                 Any answer choice that mentions capital gains taxation on annuities or retirement
                                 plans is wrong. There is only ordinary income tax on distributions from annuities.

                                      the following best describes the tax consequences of this action?                            Unit 9
                                        A. Ordinary income taxes and a 10% early withdrawal penalty will apply to all
                                            money withdrawn.
                                       B. Capital gains tax will apply to the amount of the withdrawal that represents
                                            earnings; there will be no tax on the cost basis.
                                       C. Ordinary income taxes and a 10% early withdrawal penalty will apply to the
                                            amount of the withdrawal that represents earnings; there will be no tax on the
                                            cost basis.
                                       D. Ordinary income taxes apply to the amount of the withdrawal that represents
                                            earnings; the 10% early withdrawal penalty does not apply to surrendering an
                                            annuity.
                                      Answer: C. All earnings are taxable as ordinary income. They are also subject to the
                                      10% early withdrawal penalty when withdrawn before age 59½. The contract holder
                                      recovers the cost basis without tax.

                                        Annuitization
                                        Annuitized payouts are typically made monthly and are taxed according to an exclusion ratio.
                                        Each monthly payment consists of principal plus earnings. The portion representing principal
                                        is a return of the cost basis. That is not subject to taxes—it is simply getting your original
                                        investment back. The balance of the payment is the deferred earnings and that is what will be
                                        taxed. The exclusion ratio expresses the percentage of each monthly payment that is taxable.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   An investor purchased a single premium deferred annuity with $50,000. At the time the
                                                   investor annuitized, the accumulated value was $100,000. The exclusion ratio would
                                                   hold that 50% of each payment will be treated as ordinary income and the other 50%
                                                   of each payment will be treated (for tax purposes) as nontaxable return of basis. If the
                                                   value at annuitization was $125,000, then 60% (75,000 divided by 125,000) would be
                                                   taxed as ordinary income and the balance as a nontaxable return of cost basis.
                                        There will not be a case on the exam where an investor annuitizing will be subject to the 10%
                                        penalty tax. This is true even in the unusual case where an annuitant elects to annuitize before
                                        reach age 59½.


                                        1035 Exchange
                                        A 1035 exchange is a tax-free exchange between like contracts. It gets its name from Section
                                        1035 of the IRC. The IRS allows annuity and life insurance policyholders to exchange their
                                        policies without tax current liability. For example, if a life insurance policyholder wanted to
                                        exchange his policy for one from another company, he could transfer all cash values from
                                        the old policy into the new policy without recognizing any tax consequences. Likewise, if
                                        an annuity holder decided to exchange her annuity for one offered by another company,
                                        the exchange is done without current taxation. Compare this to the mutual fund exchange
                                        privilege where there is no sales change, but, for tax purpose it is considered a sale and new
                                        purchase. This 1035 exchange provision applies to transfers of cash values from annuity to
                                        annuity, life to life, and life to annuity. It cannot be used for transfers from an annuity to a life
                                        insurance policy.

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   FINRA is concerned about Section 1035 exchange abuses where the registered
                                                   representative emphasizes the tax-free nature of the exchange without pointing out
                                                   possible disadvantages. Those include
                                                       possible surrender charges on the old policy,
                                                       a new surrender charge period on the new policy, and
                                                       possible loss of a higher death benefit that existed on the old policy.


                                        Qualified Annuities
                                        Back in Lesson 1.8, we learned about the tax-sheltered annuities (TSAs) available in 403(b)
                                        plans. Contributions to those annuities are made with pretax dollars. That means the
                                        investor's cost basis is zero. Therefore, with any withdrawal, everything is taxed as ordinary
                                        income. If the investor has not reached age 59½, the additional 10% tax penalty applies
                                        (unless annuitized or the investor dies or becomes disabled).

              LESSON 9.5: REGULATION OF VARIABLE INSURANCE PRODUCTS
                         LO 9.e Determine the rules and regulations pertaining to the sale of variable
                         products.



                         Introduction
                         Many of the rules regarding sales practices for variable products are similar to those for
                         investment companies. For example, the rules on noncash compensation are identical.


                         FINRA Rules

                         FINRA Rule 2320—Variable Contracts of an Insurance Company
                         We will use rule numbers from time to time, but you never have to memorize them. One key
                         difference between the rules for funds and those for VAs is that FINRA Rule 2320 does not
                         place a maximum sales charge on variable annuities. You might recall that FINRA Rule 2341
                         has a maximum load on mutual funds of 8.5% of the offering price.


                         Suitability of Variable Life Insurance
                         FINRA is concerned that the sale of variable life insurance is not misrepresented. Although
                         legally defined as a security, it cannot be sold solely on that basis. When tested on the
                         suitability of a recommendation for variable life, remember these three points:
                          There must be a life insurance need.
                          The applicant must be comfortable with the separate account and the fact that the cash
                           value is not guaranteed.
                          The applicant must understand the variable death benefit feature.


                         FINRA Rule 2330—Member’s Responsibilities Regarding Deferred
                         Variable Annuities
                         In light of the many cases involving variable annuities where there was failure to supervise               Unit 9
                         egregious unethical behavior, FINRA’s Rule 2330 evolved. Please notice the title. This rule
                         applies to recommended purchases and exchanges of deferred (not immediate) variable
                         annuities and recommended initial subaccount alloca­tions. On the other hand, this rule does
                         not apply to reallocations among subaccounts made or to funds paid after the initial purchase
                         or exchange of a deferred variable annuity. In other words, once the investor has made the
                         initial purchase, any subsequent investments do not come under the rule. Likewise, once the
                         initial subaccount decisions have been made, later changes are not covered by the rule.

                         The rule makes the obvious statement that no member or person associated with a mem­ber
                         shall recommend to any customer the purchase or exchange of a deferred variable annuity
                         unless the member or person associated with a member has a reasonable basis to believe that it
                         is suitable.

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   One example of egregious behavior stated in the rule (and possibly on the exam) is
                                                   recommending that a client take a home equity loan and use the proceeds to fund the
                                                   purchase of a deferred variable annuity.


                                        Specific Suitability Requirements
                                        Although there are general suitability rules that always apply, this rule specifies that, to be
                                        considered suitable, there is a reasonable basis to believe that
                                         the customer has been informed—in general terms—of various features of deferred
                                          variable annuities, such as the potential surrender period and surrender charge, which
                                          may include
                                             –   potential tax penalty if customers sell or redeem deferred variable annuities before
                                                 reaching the age of 59½,
                                             –   mortality and expense fees,
                                             –   investment advisory fees,
                                             –   potential charges for and features of riders,
                                             –   the insurance and investment components of deferred variable annuities, and
                                             –   market risk;
                                         the customer would benefit from certain features of deferred variable annuities, such as
                                          tax-deferred growth, annuitization, or a death or living benefit; and
                                         the particular deferred variable annuity as a whole, the underlying subaccounts to which
                                          funds are allocated at the time of the purchase or exchange of the deferred variable annu­
                                          ity, and riders and similar product enhancements, if any, are suitable (and, in the case of
                                          an exchange, the transaction as a whole also is suitable) for the particular customer based
                                          on the information required by this rule.


                                        Suitability of 1035 Exchanges
                                        One of the specific concerns that the regulators have with variable annuities is sales per­
                                        sonnel recommending that an investor switch from an existing contract to a new one. In the
                                        case of variable annuities, these exchanges are normally done under the provisions of IRS
                                        Section 1035 and, if done properly, are tax-free. However, it is mandatory that registered
                                        representatives and their supervisors evaluate the suitability of the exchange in light of the
                                        investor’s financial condition, objectives, and the pros and cons of the switch.

                                        Some of the negative conditions to be aware of are
                                         surrender charges imposed by the insurance company,
                                         the beginning of a new surrender period,
                                         possible reduction in death benefit,
                                         how the expenses of the new contract compare with those of the old contract, and
                                         the benefits included in the new contract may not be needed by the purchaser.

                                                                                  Unit 9   Insurance Company Products     241


                       36-Month Rule
                       One of the factors in determining if the exchange is suitable is taking into consideration
                       whether the customer has had another deferred variable annuity exchange within the
                       preceding 36 months.

                       Under this provision, it must be determined whether the customer has made a variable
                       annuity exchange using the member. It is also required that the member must make
                       reasonable efforts to ascertain whether the customer has had an exchange at any other
                       broker-dealer within the preceding 36 months. An inquiry to the customer as to whether the
                       customer has had an exchange at another broker-dealer within 36 months would constitute a
                       “reasonable effort” in this context. Members must document in writing both the nature of the
                       inquiry and the response from the customer.

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 7.   FINRA rules have evolved to protect investors. Which of the following products has
                                      been the subject of significant sales abuses?
                                       A. Fixed annuities
                                       B. Whole life insurance
                                       C. Deferred variable annuities
                                       D. Immediate variable annuities
                                      Answer: C. FINRA Rule 2330 is specifically targeted at the sale of deferred variable
                                      annuities. FINRA does not have rules regarding fixed annuities and whole life
                                      insurance policies because they are not securities.


                       Investment Company Act of 1940 Rules for Variable Life
                       Insurance
                       The SEC has no specific testable rules regarding variable annuities. The separate accounts
                       are registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The
                       requirements of that act previously covered in Unit 8 apply here as well.
                       There are, however, several specific rules under federal law applying to variable life insurance
                       contracts.


                       Policy Loans                                                                                                 Unit 9
                       Like traditional whole life insurance, a variable life insurance contract allows the insured
                       to borrow against the cash value that has accumulated in the contract. However, certain
                       restrictions exist. Usually, the insured may only borrow a percentage of the cash value. The
                       minimum percentage that must be made available is 75% after the policy has been in force for
                       three years. If the death benefit becomes payable during any period that a loan is outstanding,
                       the loan amount is deducted from the death benefit before payment. The interest rate charged
                       is stated in the policy.

                                                   Several testable facts about policy loans are as follows:
                                                       A minimum of 75% of the cash value must be available for policy loan after the
                                                        policy has been in force three years.
                                                       The insurer is never required to loan 100% of the cash value. Full cash value is
                                                        obtained by surrendering the policy to the insurer.
                                                       If the insured dies with a loan outstanding, the death benefit is reduced by the
                                                        amount of the loan.
                                                       If the insured surrenders the contract with a loan outstanding, cash value is
                                                        reduced by the amount of the loan.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   8.   On July 15, 2015, your client purchased a variable life insurance policy with a death
                                                        benefit of $500,000. The November 2017 statement showed a cash value of $30,000. If
                                                        the client wanted to borrow as much as possible, the insurance company would have
                                                        to allow a loan of at least
                                                          A. $0.
                                                         B. $15,000.
                                                         C. $22,500.
                                                         D. $27,000.
                                                        Answer: A. Until a variable life policy is in force for a minimum of three years (this
                                                        one is a bit less than 2½ years), there is no requirement to make the loan provision
                                                        available. Once the three-year mark is reached, that minimum becomes 75% of the
                                                        computed cash value.


                                        Variable Life Insurance Contract Exchange
                                        A unique feature of variable life insurance is the ability for the insured to have a change of
                                        heart. During the early stage of ownership, you have the right to exchange a variable life
                                        insurance contract for a form of permanent insurance issued by the company with comparable
                                        benefits (usually whole life). The length of time this exchange privilege is in effect varies from
                                        company to company, but under no circumstances may the period be less than 24 months
                                        (federal law).

                                        The exchange is allowed without evidence of insurability. If a contract is exchanged, the new
                                        permanent policy has the same contract date and death benefit as the minimum guaranteed in
                                        the variable life insurance contract. The premiums equal the amounts guaranteed in the new
                                        permanent contract (as if it were the original contract).

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   Three testable facts about the contract exchange provision follow:
                                                       The contract exchange provision must be available for a minimum of two years.
                                                       No medical underwriting (evidence of insurability) is required for the exchange.
                                                       The new policy is issued as if everything were retroactive. That is, the age of the
                                                        insured as of the original date is the age used for premium calculations for the
                                                        new policy.

                       Sales Charges
                       The sales charges on a fixed-premium variable life contract may not exceed 9% of the
                       payments to be made over the life of the contract. The contract’s life, for purposes of this
                       charge, is a maximum of 20 years. For those of you familiar with life insurance compensation,
                       the effect of this is that renewal commissions are earned up to the 20th anniversary of policy
                       issue.


                       Refund Provisions
                       The insurer must extend a free-look period to the policyowner for 45 days from the execution
                       of the application, or for 10 days from the time the owner receives the policy, whichever is
                       longer. During the free-look period, the policyowner may terminate the policy and receive all
                       payments made.

                       The refund provisions extend for two years from issuance of the policy. If, within the two-year
                       period, the policyowner terminates participation in the contract, the insurer must refund the
                       contract’s cash value (the value calculated after the insurer receives the redemption notice)
                       plus a percentage of the sales charges deducted. After the two-year period has lapsed, only the
                       cash value need be refunded; the insurer retains all sales charges.

                                 TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                 Several testable facts about sales charges and refunds are as follows:
                                    The maximum sales charge over the life of the contract is 9%.
                                    A policyowner who wants a refund within 45 days receives all money paid.
                                    From 45 days to two years, there is a partial refund of sale charge.
                                    After a variable life policy has been in effect for two years, the surrender value of
                                     the policy is the cash value; there is no sales charge refund.

              INTRODUCTION
                         For many exam candidates, understanding option contracts is one of the more challenging
                         concepts. Be sure to review each section of the unit thoroughly.

                         Most questions will be on equity options (options on stock), but expect some to involve
                         nonequity options, such as index, interest rate, and foreign currency contracts.

                         Before we get into the details, we need to explain the term option. It is not new to any of us. All
                         during our life, we have had options. Think of an option as a choice. When we were in school,
                         we had choices of which electives to take, or which sports to play. When we buy a car, we make
                         a choice. In fact, the dealer gives us a list of options we can add to the car.

                         In this business, an option is also a choice. One type of option gives us the choice to buy a stock
                         if we wish. The other type of option gives us the choice to sell a stock if we wish. Those choices,
                         and the details behind them, such as cost and when to choose, are detailed in the option
                         contract.

           LESSON 10.1: BASIC OPTIONS INCLUDING THE ROLE OF THE OCC
                                           LO 10.a Identify the basic characteristics of option contracts.



                                           The Options Contract
                                           An option is a two-party contract that conveys a right to the buyer and an obligation to the
                                           seller. The terms of option contracts are standardized by the Options Clearing Corporation
                                           (OCC). This standardization allows options to be traded easily on an exchange such as the
                                           Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE). The underlying security for which an option
                                           contract is created may be a stock, stock market index, foreign currency, interest rate, or
                                           government bond.

                                           Options are called derivative securities because their value is derived from the value of the
                                           underlying instrument, such as stock, an index, or a foreign currency. The most common
                                           type of option contract is an equity option where each contract represents 100 shares of the
                                           underlying stock.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     Because the CBOE was the first exchange to trade listed options, and is still by far the
                                                     largest, most of our discussions will deal with their procedures. It may be necessary
                                                     to know that the CBOE also offers option contracts known as mini-options. These
                                                     contracts overlay only 10 shares of the underlying security instead of 100 shares, as is
                                                     the case for standard options contracts.
                                                     With standard contracts, the multiplier is 100 (Ex: 2 premium = $200). With mini-option
                                                     contracts, the multiplier is only 10. Therefore, a mini-option contract premium of 2
                                                     represents only $20.
                                           The following terminology and concepts should be associated with the two parties to each
                                           contract: buyer and seller.

                An investor                          is obligated to
                                                                               the underlying asset at the      For agreeing to these

                                     Every option contract has three specifications:
                                      Underlying instrument. Anything with fluctuating value can be the underlying instrument
                                       of an option contract. We will focus on common stock until later in the unit.
                                      Price. The contract specifies a strike or exercise price (strike price) at which purchase or
                                       sale of the underlying security will occur.
                                      Expiration. All contracts have a specified life cycle and expire on a specified date. Once a
                                       contract is issued, it can be bought or sold any time during its life cycle.
                                          –      Standard contracts are issued with nine-month expirations and expire on the third
                                                 Friday of the expiration month at 11:59 pm ET.
                                          –      Long-term equity anticipation securities (LEAPS) have maximum expirations of 39
                                                 months. Though the maximum is 39 months, most trade with a 30-month life cycle.
                                                 The length of time until the contract expires is the one contract specification that can
                                                 be customized between buyer and seller when the contract first trades.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   An option contract might look like this: ABC 40 NOV Call. That means the underlying
                                                   asset is 100 shares of ABC common stock. The strike (exercise) price is $40 per share.
                                                   The option expires in November. Another option might be an XYZ 65 JUL Put. The
                                                   underlying asset is 100 shares of XYZ common stock. The strike price is 65 and the
                                                   option expires in July. Let’s go further by describing the difference between a call
                                                   option and a put option.

                                           Types of Options
                                           Options are categorized by type, class, and series:
                                            Type. There are two types of options: calls and puts.
                                            Class. All options of the same type on the same underlying security are considered as
                                             being of the same class (e.g., all ALF calls make up one class of options; all ALF puts
                                             make up another class of options).
                                            Series. All options of the same class, exercise price, and expiration month are in the same
                                             series. For instance, all Jan 45 ACM puts make up one series; all Jan 50 ACM puts make
                                             up another series.

                                           We are going to focus on the two types of options contracts: the call contract and the put
                                           contract.


                                           Calls
                                           An investor may buy calls (go long) or sell or write calls (go short). The features of each side of
                                           a call contract are as follows:
                                            Long call. A call buyer owns the right to buy 100 shares of a specific stock at the exercise
                                             (strike) price before the expiration if he chooses to exercise. The holder (owner) of the
                                             option can also sell the option if he desires.
                                            Short call. A call writer (seller) has the obligation to sell 100 shares of a specific stock at
                                             the strike price if the buyer exercises the contract.


                                           Puts
                                           An investor may buy puts (go long) or sell puts (go short). The features of each side of a put
                                           contract are noted as follows:
                                            Long put. A put buyer owns the right to sell 100 shares of a specific stock at the exercise
                                             (strike) price if she chooses to exercise. The holder (owner) of the option can also sell the
                                             option if she desires.
                                            Short put. A put writer (seller) has the obligation to buy 100 shares of a specific stock at
                                             the strike price if the buyer exercises the contract.

                                                      TAKE NOTE
                                                      Buyers of options call the shots; they are in control. They choose to exercise or not to
                                                      exercise. That is why buyers pay premiums. The writer is at the mercy of the buyer’s
                                                      decision. Options are exercised against the writer when the buyer makes that decision.
                                                      Writers do not have the opportunity to choose to exercise.
                                                         The buyer wants the contract to be exercised. He wins, and the seller loses at
                                                          exercise.
                                                         The seller wants the contract to expire. The seller wins at expiration because he
                                                          gets to keep the premium. No purchase or sale of stock is required.
                                           You can answer a significant number of test questions by knowing that buyers have rights and
                                           sellers have obligations.

                                                                                                      Unit 10   Options     249


                                 EXAMPLE
                                 Following is an example of what an options trade ticket would reflect.
                                 Long 1 XYZ Jan 60 call at 3

                                  Long     The investor has bought the call and has the right to exercise the contract.
                                  XYZ      The single contract represents 100 shares of XYZ stock.
                                  Jan      The contract expires on the third Friday of January at 11:59 pm ET.
                                  60       The strike price of the contract is 60.
                                  Call     The type of option is a call, and the investor has the right to buy the stock at 60
                                           because he is long the call.
                                  3        The premium of the contract is $3 per share. Contracts are for 100 shares, so
                                           the total premium is $300. The investor paid the premium to buy the call. The
                                           seller (writer) received the $300 premium for selling the option.


                       Opening and Closing Positions
                       When an investor establishes the option position by buying or writing calls or puts, the
                       order ticket and confirmation are marked Opening Purchase or Opening Sale. The key is the
                       first step—to open. A customer who buys an option generally may sell that option at any
                       time before it expires. This offsetting transaction is known as a closing sale, and the ticket
                       memorandum and confirmation are marked Closing Sale. Therefore, as with much that we
                       buy, we open with a purchase and close (unload it) with a sale.

                       A customer who sold an option as an opening transaction may, at any time before the option
                       expires, buy back the option. This transaction is known as a closing purchase, and the ticket
                       and confirmation are marked Closing Purchase.

                       Because the price of the underlying stock will change over the life of the option, an inves­tor
                       may not be able to make a closing transaction at the same price as his opening transaction.
                       Gains or losses on closing transactions result from the difference between premiums paid and
                       received.


                       Settlement Dates
                       When options are bought and sold, the settlement is the next business day. We refer to that as
                       T+1 in the industry. Unlike stocks and bonds, there are no certificates for options. That makes
                       settlement much quicker. An investor purchasing an option on Tuesday must pay for it by the
                       close of business Wednesday. Investors selling an option on Tuesday will have the proceeds
                       credited to their account by the close of business Wednesday.

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 Without a certificate, how does the client prove ownership? The investor’s proof of
                                 ownership of an option is the trade confirmation.

                                          LO 10.b Indicate the functions of the Options Clearing Corporation.



                                          Role of the OCC
                                          The Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), an SRO, is the issuer of listed options contracts.
                                          It is owned by the exchanges that trade options. Its primary functions are to standardize,
                                          guarantee the performance of, and issue option contracts. The OCC determines when new
                                          option contracts will be offered to the market. It designates the strike prices and expiration
                                          months for new contracts within market standards to maintain uniformity and liquidity. It is
                                          important to note that the OCC does not determine option premiums. Supply and demand
                                          in the trading markets determines the premium for the contracts.

                                          One of the important guarantees of the OCC is the exercise of options contracts. That means,
                                          if for some reason a seller is unable to perform, the OCC does. If a holder of an option wishes
                                          to exercise, her broker-dealer notifies the OCC. The OCC then assigns exercise notice against
                                          a broker-dealer with a customer who has written that option. The broker-dealer then assigns
                                          that exercise noted to a customer with a short position.

                                                     PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                     1.   A listed ABC May 35 call option is issued by

                                                           B. the seller of the call option.
                                                           C. the exchange on which the option is traded.
                                                           D. the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC).
                                                          Answer: D. The OCC is the issuer of all listed options. There are unlisted options, but
                                                          we don’t expect you will see anything about them on the exam.


                                          Assignment of Exercise Notices
                                          As we have learned, an investor who is long an option contract (the holder or owner), can
                                          choose to exercise that option. In the case of a call, that would be exercising the right to buy
                                          at the strike price. In the case of a put, that would be exercising the right to sell at the strike
                                          price.

                                          When the OCC is notified by a broker-dealer that one of its customers wants to exercise,
                                          the OCC randomly selects a firm with a short position in that option to which it assigns the
                                          exercise. The OCC assigns exercise notices on a random basis. Then, it is up to the assigned
                                          broker-dealer to determine which of its clients is going to be obligated.

                                          Broker-dealers have three ways to allocate exercise assignments. They may allocate to
                                          customers on
                                           a random basis;
                                           a first in, first out (FIFO) method; or
                                           any other method that is fair and reasonable.
                                          Commonly referred to as the notification of allocation method, each member firm must
                                          inform its options customers in writing of how it allocates exercise notices (assignments) and
                                          the consequences of the method of allocation used.

                         One method that is not considered fair and reasonable (and is often tested) is selecting
                         based on the size of the writer’s position. Although those who have written 100 contracts are
                         more likely to be selected randomly than a client who is short one contract, the firm cannot
                         deliberately choose the client with the largest short position.


                         Delivery After Exercise
                         Upon exercise of an option, the parties are now required to make settlement. The assigned
                         party (the writer) must either deliver the stock within two business days (for a call) or buy the
                         stock within two business days (for a put) from notification of exercise. This is the same T+2
                         settlement requirement as any stock trade.

                         Wait a minute. Didn’t we say just a bit earlier in this unit that option trades settle T+1 (next
                         business day)? Yes, we did. Follow this Test Topic Alert.

                                   The exam will try to trick you with settlement dates. The settlement date for equity
                                   options is the next business day. That is, when an option is bought or sold, that option
                                   trade settles T+1. If an equity option is exercised, what happens? Stock is either
                                   bought (call) or sold (put) and that is treated as any other equity transaction. That
                                   means T+2 settlement date.


              LESSON 10.2: VALUING OPTIONS

                         LO 10.c Distinguish between the various options values.



                         Introduction
                         How does an investor know if an option is fairly priced? We need to learn the factors
                         evaluated by investors that influence the price of an option contract.


                         Factors in Options Valuation

                         Intrinsic Value
                         Probably the most important item is the option’s intrinsic value. Understanding intrinsic value
                         requires that we learn several terms. We are going to look at both calls and puts.


                         In the Money
                         A call is in the money when the market price of the underlying asset exceeds the strike price of
                         the option. Buyers want options to be in the money; sellers do not. It is critical to understand

                                                                                                                                     Unit 10
                         that the term in the money (or out of the money) refers to the option, not to the investor.

                                   EXAMPLE
                                   An ABC 50 call is in the money by 7 points when the price of ABC stock is 57.

                                           A put option is in the money when the market price of the underlying asset is less than the
                                           strike price of the option. Buyers generally benefit when contracts are in the money, whereas
                                           sellers do not.

                                                      EXAMPLE
                                                      An ABC 50 put is in the money by 4 points when ABC stock is at 46.


                                           At the Money
                                           A call or a put is at the money when the market price of the underlying asset equals the strike
                                           price of the option.

                                                      EXAMPLE
                                                      An ABC 50 call is at the money when the price of ABC stock is 50.
                                                      An ABC 50 put is at the money when the price of ABC stock is 50.


                                           Out of the Money
                                           A call option is out of the money when the market price of the underlying asset is less than
                                           the strike price of the option. A buyer will not exercise calls that are out of the money at
                                           expiration. Out of the money contracts are advantageous to sellers. The options expire and
                                           sellers keep the premium without obligations to perform.

                                                      EXAMPLE
                                                      An ABC 50 call is out of the money by 4 points when the price of ABC stock is 46.

                                           A put option is out of the money when the market price of the underlying asset is greater than
                                           the strike price of the option. A buyer will not exercise puts that are out of the money. Sellers
                                           benefit when contracts are out of the money.

                                                      EXAMPLE
                                                      An ABC 50 put is out of the money by 7 points when the price of ABC stock is 57.

                                                      TAKE NOTE
                                                      We did not consider the premium in any of the three examples because we are only
                                                      considering the option, not the investor.
                                           Did you notice how puts and calls are opposite each other? When the call was in the money
                                           (the stock’s price went up), the put was out of the money by an equal amount. Many students
                                           have found the following phrase (which we will use several times) to be quite helpful.

                                           Call UP and Put DOWN.

                                           That is, calls become beneficial to the owner when the price of the stock goes up. Puts become
                                           beneficial to the owner when the price of the stock goes down.

                                           Now we can come back to intrinsic value. Intrinsic value is the same as the amount a
                                           contract is in the money. A call has intrinsic value when the market price of the stock is
                                           above the strike price of the call. Options never have negative intrinsic value; intrinsic value
                                           is always a positive amount or zero. Options that are at the money or out of the money have
                                           an intrinsic value of zero. Buyers like calls to have intrinsic value; sellers (writers) do not. An

                       option that has intrinsic value at expiration will be exercised or sold by the buyer. An option
                       that has no intrinsic value at the expiration date will simply be allowed to expire.

                       During the lifetime of an option contract, buyers want the contract to move in the money;
                       sellers want the contract to move out of the money.

                                 EXAMPLE
                                 In, at, and out of the money—An option is in the money by the amount of its
                                 intrinsic value.

                                 Puts: in the Money, at the Money, Out of the Money

                                  Ex: Puts                         Intrinsic Value             In, Out, at the Money

                                  40 Put, stock @ 44        0 points (strike price < stock)      Out of the money


                       Time Value
                       The second component in valuing an option is its time value. Quite simply, time value is a
                       function of the time remaining before the option expires. On the expiration date, the time
                       value is zero—there isn’t any more time left. An option expiring in nine months has more
                       time value than one expiring in six months. The option expiring in six months has more time
                       value than one expiring in one month.

                       How do you compute time value? That will likely be a question on your exam. An option has
                       time value anytime the option’s premium exceeds its intrinsic value.

                       The amount an option buyer will pay (and a seller will accept) above an option’s intrinsic
                       value is the time value. An option expires on a preset date; the further away that date is, the
                       more time there is available for a change in the price of the underlying stock. The amount of
                       time in the contract, therefore, has value to the option buyer. You can expect buyers to pay
                       more for a contract that has a long time to run than for a contract that is about to expire.

                                 Remember these three points:


                                                                                                                                 Unit 10

                       As the option’s expiration date approaches, time value will diminish. That is known as time
                       decay. On the last trading day before expiration, the option no longer has time value and the
                       premium usually equals the intrinsic value.

                                                     An option premium is composed of two components: intrinsic value and time value.
                                                     To compute time value, subtract intrinsic value from the premium. If an option is at or
                                                     out of the money, the entire premium is time value. For example, an XYZ NOV 40 put
                                                     has a premium of 1.25 when XYZ stock is selling at 41. With the market price above
                                                     the strike price (41 is higher than 40), the option is out of the money. That means no
                                                     intrinsic value. Therefore, the entire premium of $1.25 ($125) is time value.

                                                     PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                     2.   Which of the following option contracts has no time value?
                                                           A. ABC OCT 50 call @ 2 with ABC at 51
                                                           B. DEF NOV 60 call @ 2 with DEF at 62
                                                           C. GHI DEC 50 put @2 with GHI at 49
                                                           D. JKL JAN 60 put @ 2 with JKL at 62
                                                          Answer: B. An option’s time value is the difference between the premium and the
                                                          intrinsic value. In choice B, the call option has 2 points of intrinsic value. It is in the
                                                          money because the strike price is below the market. Therefore, the premium of 2 is
                                                          equal to the intrinsic value. That means the option is selling at parity and had no time
                                                          value. In choice A, the option is 1 point in the money. With a premium of 2, the other
                                                          point represents time value. In choice C, the option is 1 point in the money. With
                                                          a premium of 2, the other point represents time value. In choice D, the option is 2
                                                          points out of the money so the entire premium is time value.


                                           Trading at Parity
                                           An option is trading at parity when the premium equals the intrinsic value of the contract
                                           (e.g., a May 35 call is at parity when the market price is 40 and the premium is 5. A May 35
                                           put is at parity when the market price is 30 and the premium is 5).

                                           Options generally trade at parity just before the expiration date. Why is that? If the premium
                                           is equal to the intrinsic (in the money) value, what pricing component is missing? We are
                                           missing the time value. When is there no time value to an option? When there is no time—
                                           just before the option expires.

                                     Buying Calls
                                     Here is how the exam might describe an investor’s position:

                                     The investor is long 1 XYZ Jan 60 call at 3.
                                     We need to be sure we know exactly what that means.
                                     Long         The investor has bought the call and has the right to exercise the contract.
                                     XYZ          The contract includes 100 shares of XYZ stock.
                                     Jan          The contract expires on the third Friday of January at 11:59 pm ET.
                                     60           The exercise (strike) price of the contract is 60.
                                     Call         The type of option is a call, and the investor has the right to buy the stock at 60
                                                  because she is long the call.
                                     3            The premium of the contract is $3 per share. Contracts are issued with 100 shares,
                                                  so the total premium is $300. The investor paid the premium to buy the call.

                                     Buyers of calls want the market price of the underlying stock to rise. The investor who owns
                                     this call hopes that the market price will rise above 60. She then has the right to buy the stock
                                     at the strike price of 60, even if the market price is higher (e.g., 80). We know that is the
                                     strategy because when it comes to buying a call, Call UP is the phrase we remember.

                                           Selling Calls
                                           Here is the way the exam might describe an investor’s position:

                                           Short XYZ Jan 60 call at 3
                                           We need to be sure we know exactly what that means.
                                           Short    The investor has sold the call and has obligations to perform if the contract is
                                                    exercised.
                                           XYZ      The contract includes 100 shares of XYZ stock.
                                           Jan      The contract expires on the third Friday of January at 11:59 pm ET. If
                                                    expiration occurs, the writer keeps the premium without any obligation.
                                           60       The strike price of the contract is 60.
                                           Call     The type of option is a call, and the investor is obligated to sell the stock at
                                                    60, if exercised, because she is short the call.
                                           3        The premium of the contract is $3 per share. Options contracts are issued
                                                    with 100 shares, so the total premium is $300.

                                           Writers (sellers) of calls want the market price of the underlying stock to fall or stay the same.
                                           The investor who owns this call hopes that the market price will rise above 60. The contract
                                           will not be exercised if the market price is at or below 60 at expiration, and the writer keeps
                                           the premium of $300 with no obligation.

                                                      TAKE NOTE
                                                      A call buyer is a bullish investor because he wants the market to rise. That way the
                                                      option gets in the money—it has value. The call may be exercised or sold and the
                                                      buyer may make a profit.
                                                      A call writer is a bearish or neutral investor because she wants the market to fall.
                                                      Alternatively, she will be happy if the stock’s price does not rise above the strike price.
                                                      If, at expiration, there is no intrinsic value, the option expires and the seller has earned
                                                      the premium.

                                                      TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                      It is critical that you recognize that only one side wins. The amount that a buyer makes
                                                      when the stock price goes up is the amount the seller loses. If the stock price falls or
                                                      stays at the strike price, the amount the buyer loses is the amount the seller makes.
                                                      You will see this vividly later in this unit.


                                           Long Call Option Strategies
                                           Call buyers are bullish on the underlying stock. By purchasing calls, an investor can profit
                                           from an increase in a stock’s price while investing a relatively small amount of money. There
                                           are many reasons why investors purchase calls.


                                           Speculation
                                           Speculation is the most common reason for buying calls. Investors can speculate on the
                                           upward price movement of the stock by paying only the premium. Buying the actual stock
                                           would require a far greater investment. This is a form of leverage as shown in the following
                                           example.




Series_7_2E.indb 256                                                                                                                             11/19/2021 7:53:00 PM
                                                                                                       Unit 10   Options     257


                                  EXAMPLE
                                  If ABC is trading at $40 (for a cost of $4,000) and an ABC 40 call is trading at 4 ($400 per
                                  contract), the investor can buy either the call or the stock. If he buys the ABC stock and
                                  its price goes up to $50 a share, he makes a $1,000 profit—a 25% return on the original
                                  $4,000 investment.
                                  The same movement in the stock will make the ABC 40 call worth at least its in­trinsic
                                  value of 10 ($1,000). If the investor instead buys the ABC 40 call for $400, he can realize
                                  a $600 profit ($1,000 less the $400 premium)—a 150% return on a $400 investment.
                                  The option strategy provides the investor with greater leverage (a higher potential
                                  percentage return).
                                  However, if the stock price falls, the investor risks the entire $4,000 purchase price (the
                                  stock can fall to zero and become worthless). The option owner can lose the entire
                                  investment, but a $400 loss is less painful than a $4,000 loss.


                       Deferring a Decision
                       An investor can buy a call on a stock and lock in a purchase price until the option expires.
                       This allows him to postpone making a financial commitment other than the premium until
                       the expiration date of the option. This is often used when an investor has funds coming due
                       in the future and wants to preserve today’s price. An example would be a maturing CD with a
                       penalty for early withdrawal.

                       With limited funds, an investor can buy calls on a variety of stocks and possibly profit from
                       any rise in the options premium.


                       Protection of a Short Stock Position
                       Investors can use calls to protect a short stock position. The option acts as an insurance policy
                       against the stock rising in price. Investors who short stock lose when the price of the stock
                       rises. Because there is theoretically no limit as to how high that price can go, these investors
                       face a potentially unlimited loss. A popular way to hedge (protect) against that loss is to buy a
                       call on the stock. That way, short sellers knows the most they would have to pay to cover their
                       short stock position.


                       Short Call Option Strategies
                       Call writers are bearish or neutral on the price of the underlying stock. An investor who
                       believes a stock’s price will decline or stay the same can write calls for any of the following
                       reasons.


                       Covered vs. Uncovered Call Writers
                       Before we go further, it is necessary to distinguish between a covered and an uncovered call
                                                                                                                                       Unit 10
                       option. First of all, the terms are only related to short calls. There is no such term as a
                       covered (or uncovered) long call. When a call option is covered, it means the investor owns
                       the number of shares “covered” by the option contract. For example, if the writer is selling 3
                       contracts, 300 shares of the stock is in the writer’s account. Instead of having the actual stock,
                       the option can be covered by a security convertible, at no cost, into the appropriate number of
                       shares. That would include convertible debentures or preferred stock.

                                          A second way to cover a short call is with a long call with the same or lower strike price and
                                          an expiration date no sooner than that of the short call. For example, if an investor who does
                                          not own the stock sells an LMN OCT 45 call and buys an LMN OCT 40 call, she has covered
                                          the short call. If the price of the LMN stock goes up, say to 60, the 45 call will be exercised.
                                          The investor does not have the stock, but, instead of having to go into the marketplace and
                                          buy LMN at 60, she will exercise her long 40 call and the stock purchased at 40 will be used
                                          to deliver against the exercise of the 45 call.

                                          A call option is uncovered when an investor writes a call option without owning the
                                          underlying stock or other related assets that would enable the investor to deliver the stock
                                          should the option be exercised. You may also see this referred to as a naked write.

                                          Remember, the seller of an option has an obligation. The OCC, who stands behind all options
                                          exercise, wants to be sure that, if exercised, the writer can perform. In the case of a call, the
                                          obligation is to deliver stock. If the writer already has the stock (or something convertible into
                                          it), we know the obligation can be met. When the option is uncovered, that protection does
                                          not exist. In that case, a specified cash deposit (not tested) must be made by the seller to be
                                          sure there will be funds available to buy the stock to deliver.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     A corporation cannot write calls on common stock it has issued.

                                                     TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                     Naked call writers face unlimited potential risk of loss. Remember, the obligation of a
                                                     call writer is to deliver stock at the exercise price. A call option will be exercised when
                                                     the market price is above the strike price. When that happens to an uncovered writer,
                                                     he must buy the stock in the market, paying whatever the going price is. As we have
                                                     discussed previously, there is no theoretical limit as to how high a stock’s price can go.
                                                     You will need to know for the exam the two strategies in the investment business that
                                                     have the potential for an unlimited loss:
                                                         Writing (selling) an uncovered call option
                                                         Selling stock short


                                          Increasing Returns
                                          Writing options is an income strategy, whether covered or naked. If the option is covered, the
                                          premium adds to any dividend on the underlying stock. This generates additional income for
                                          the portfolio. Investors hope for expiration of the calls so they can keep the premiums.


                                          Speculation
                                          By writing calls, an investor can profit if the stock’s price falls below or stays at the strike price.
                                          The investor will then earn the premium. This is most often the strategy of the uncovered
                                          writer.


                                          Locking in a Sale Price
                                          If an investor has an unrealized profit in a stock and is interested in selling it, a call can be
                                          written at an exercise price that will attempt to lock in that profit.

                                  EXAMPLE
                                  An investor owns 100 shares of RFQ purchased at $50 per share. The stock is now
                                  selling at $75 per share. He is sitting with an unrealized profit of $25 per share, but is
                                  concerned the market may turn the other way. If the investor writes an RFQ 75 call for
                                  4 points and the stock goes up to $85 per share, the option is 10 points in the money.
                                  That means the holder (owner) of the call will certainly exercise and the writer will
                                  wind up selling his stock at the $75 exercise price. Yes, it would have been nice to still
                                  own the stock, but he did make that $25 per share profit plus the 4-point premium.


                       Protection of a Long Position
                       The premium collected from writing a call provides limited downside protection to the extent
                       of the premium received. Using the above example, that premium of 4 points would keep the
                       investor from losing money until the stock dropped below 71 (75 – 4). Shortly, we will show
                       you a better way to protect the long stock position from a severe drop in the market price.


                       Ratio Call Writing
                       Ratio call writing involves selling more calls than the long stock position covers. This strategy
                       generates additional premium income for the investor, but also entails unlimited risk because
                       of the short uncovered calls.

                                  EXAMPLE
                                  An investor who is long 100 shares of HIJ common stock writes 2 HIJ OCT 45 calls. This
                                  is a 2:1 ratio write because the ratio of total calls to covered calls is 2:1. The 100 shares
                                  in the account is enough to cover one of the calls. The other call is uncovered and that
                                  means the potential loss is unlimited.


                       Long Put Option Strategies
                       Put buyers are bearish on the underlying stock. By purchasing puts, an investor can profit
                       from a decrease in a stock’s price while investing a relatively small amount of money. The
                       following are reasons that investors purchase puts.


                       Speculation
                       Investors can speculate on the downward price movement of the stock by paying only the
                       premium. If the market price of the stock falls below the strike price, the option is in the
                       money and may result in a profit to the buyer. This is a low risk alternative to selling a stock
                       short (to be covered in Unit 16).


                       Deferring a Decision
                       An investor can buy a put on a stock and lock in a sale price until the option expires. This
                       allows her to postpone a selling decision until the expiration date of the option. With this

                                                                                                                                        Unit 10
                       strategy, an investor not only locks in an acceptable sales price for stock that is owned, but
                       also protects its appreciation potential until the expiration date. As we will learn later in this
                       unit, this technique might have beneficial tax advantages.

                                           Protection of a Long Stock Position
                                           Investors can use puts to protect a long stock position. The option acts as an insurance policy
                                           against the stock declining in price. This is the perfect hedge for a long stock position. For the
                                           cost of the premium (like any insurance policy), the owner of the stock knows he can sell his
                                           position at the strike price, no matter how far the market price falls.


                                           Short Put Option Strategies
                                           Covered vs. Uncovered Put Writers
                                           Before we go further, it is necessary to distinguish between a covered and an uncovered put
                                           option.

                                           Covered puts work like covered calls, except that the “covering” equity position is a short
                                           stock position instead of long. There are two ways to cover a put:
                                            Taking a short position in the stock underlying the short put
                                            A cash-covered put
                                           The obligation of the put writer is to pay the exercising holder the exercise price. That requires
                                           money. A deposit of cash into the writer’s account ensures that the money is there, if needed.
                                           The concept of the short sale covering the put is a bit more complicated. Just accept the fact
                                           that it works.

                                           Put writers are bullish or neutral on the price of the underlying stock. An investor who
                                           believes a stock’s price will increase or stay the same can write puts for the following reasons.


                                           Speculation
                                           By writing puts, an investor can profit if the stock’s price rises above or stays at the strike
                                           price. The investor can earn the premium.


                                           Increasing Returns
                                           As with call writers, the premium is a source of income. Additional income can be earned for
                                           a portfolio by writing puts. Investors hope for expiration of the puts so that they can keep the
                                           premium.


                                           Buying Stock Below Its Current Price
                                           The premium received from writing puts can be used to offset the cost of stock when the put
                                           is exercised against the writer. The writer’s actual cost becomes the strike minus the premium
                                           received. This is a popular technique for investors who believe a stock’s current price is too
                                           high.


                                           Open Interest
                                           One of the tools used to determine strategy is the put-call ratio. It uses the open interest in
                                           puts and calls. The open interest in an option is the number of contracts outstanding. The
                                           higher the open interest, the more liquid the option. As an option approaches expiration,
                                           open interest begins to decline as investors close out or exercise existing positions.

                         The put-call ratio reflects the current open interest in the trading of put options to call
                         options. The ratio can be used as a gauge of investor sentiment (bullish or bearish) and can
                         be calculated to measure broad sectors of the market across many underlying securities or
                         indexes, or it can be used to gauge investor sentiment for just one underlying security.

                         The ratio is calculated by dividing the number of traded put options by the number of traded
                         call options. The higher the ratio, the more bearish investors have been up to that point in
                         time. For instance, as the ratio increases, it can be interpreted as an indication that investors
                         felt the market sector or underlying security would move lower and were buying more puts, or
                         investors were purchasing puts to hedge existing long portfolios in anticipation of a downward
                         move.

                         However, it should also be noted that the ratio can be used as a contrarian indicator by
                         traders. For example, the higher the ratio becomes, it is likely that traders may feel it is time
                         to close or cover short positions in favor of long positions. In other words, the ratio may have
                         become so high that the continued bearish sentiment begins to diminish, indicating that a
                         reversal may be near.


              LESSON 10.4: ADVANCED OPTIONS STRATEGIES

                         LO 10.e Recognize the different spread strategies.



                         Introduction
                         As investors become more familiar with options, they recognize there are advanced strategies
                         that can offer them opportunities to improve their portfolio results. The first of these strategies
                         is spreading. The first thing to understand is that the word spread always refers to a difference.
                         When we were quoting securities, the spread was the difference between the bid and ask
                         price. With options, a spread always involves some difference. As we will cover, it could be
                         a difference in exercise prices, it could be a difference in expiration dates, or it could be a
                         difference in both.


                         Spreads
                         A spread is the simultaneous purchase of one option and sale of another option of the same
                         class:
                          A call spread is a long call and a short call.
                          A put spread is a long put and a short put.
                         You may see questions on the exam that ask you to identify what position the investor has
                         established. The following master options chart will give you the answer. The horizontal ovals
                         shown in the chart identify the two types of spreads: call spreads and put spreads.

                         As you solve questions, point at the investor’s options positions on your chart. You will easily           Unit 10
                         identify what type of position has been created.

                                           Types of Spreads
                                           Investors can buy or sell three types of spreads: a price or vertical spread, a time or calendar
                                           spread, or a diagonal spread.


                                           Price or Vertical Spread
                                           A price spread or vertical spread is one that has different strike prices but the same
                                           expiration date. It may be called a vertical spread because strike prices on options reports are
                                           reported vertically.

                                                      EXAMPLE
                                                      Example of a price or vertical spread:
                                                      Long RST Nov 50 call for 7
                                                      Short RST Nov 60 call for 3
                                                      This is a price or vertical spread because the difference in the two options is the 50 and
                                                      60 strike prices (not the premiums).

                                                      TAKE NOTE
                                                      The most common spread, and the one most likely to occur on the exam, is the price
                                                      spread or vertical spread, in which the two options have the same expiration date but
                                                      different strike prices.


                                           Time or Calendar Spread
                                           A time spread or calendar spread, also known as a horizontal spread, includes option
                                           contracts with different expiration dates but the same strike prices. Investors who establish
                                           these do not expect great stock price volatility. Instead, they hope to profit from the different
                                           rates at which the time values of the two option premiums erode. Thus, their outlook is
                                           neutral. Time spreads are called horizontal spreads because expiration months are arranged
                                           horizontally on options reports.

                                  EXAMPLE
                                  Example of a time or calendar spread:
                                  Long RST Nov 60 call for 3
                                  Short RST Jan 60 call for 5
                                  This is a time or horizontal spread because the difference in the two options is the Nov
                                  and Jan expiration dates (time).


                       Diagonal Spread
                       A diagonal spread is one in which the options differ in both time and price. On an options
                       report, a line connecting these two positions would appear as a diagonal.

                                  EXAMPLE
                                  Example of a diagonal spread:
                                  Long RST Jan 55 call for 6
                                  Short RST Nov 60 call for 3
                                  This is a diagonal spread because both the strike prices and expiration dates are
                                  different.


                       Bull and Bear Spreads
                       As we have learned, a spread is an investor buying one option and selling another of the same
                       class. Although there are spreads where the outlook is neutral (the investor profits if the stock’s
                       price is stable), most of the exam questions deal with bull and bear spreads. The easiest way to
                       identify these is to remember that bulls always buy low and sell high. That is, a bull spread is
                       created when the investor buys the option with the low strike price and sells the option with
                       the high strike.

                       Please note, this is the strike or exercise price we are looking at, not the premium. If a bull
                       spread is buying low and selling high, then a bear spread is buying high and selling low.


                       Debit and Credit Spreads
                       Spreads are categorized as debit spreads or credit spreads. A spread is a debit spread if the
                       long option has a higher premium than the short option; a spread is a credit spread if the
                       short option has a higher premium than the long option. Put into practical terms, if the
                       option you buy costs more than the one you sell, you must pay the difference. In essence, your
                       account is debited (charged) for the net cost. If the option you sell brings in more than the
                       one you buy, your account is credited with the difference. That makes it a credit spread.

                       The simplest way to determine a debit or a credit is to use a T-chart. This is done by drawing
                       a chart with DR for debit on the left side and CR for credit on the right side. Here are four
                       examples.

                                                      EXAMPLE
                                                      An investor establishes a call spread by going long one RST Jan 55 call for a premium
                                                      of 6 and short 1 RST Jan 65 call for a premium of 2:
                                                       DR     CR
                                                       6
                                                              2
                                                       4
                                                      This spread is a debit spread because the premium paid was more than the premium
                                                      received. We see that clearly with the 6 in the debit column and the 2 in the credit
                                                      column. The net outlay was 4 points.

                                                      EXAMPLE
                                                      An investor establishes a call spread by going long one RST Jan 55 call for a premium
                                                      of 2 and short 1 RST Jan 45 call for a premium of 6:
                                                       DR     CR
                                                       2
                                                              6
                                                              4
                                                      This spread is a credit spread because the premium received was more than the
                                                      premium paid. We see that clearly with the 6 in the credit column and the 2 in the
                                                      debit column. The net amount received was 4.
                                           One thing you should notice with these two examples—the lower the strike price, the higher
                                           the premium. After all, with a call option, the ability to buy stock at 45 is certainly more
                                           valuable than having the option to buy it at 55. To show you how that might appear on the
                                           exam, look at this example:

                                                      EXAMPLE
                                                      An investor establishes a call spread position buy going long an ABC 60 call and
                                                      short an ABC 65 call. Is this a debit or a credit spread? How can we tell? There are no
                                                      premiums to put into our T-chart. How do we know if we are paying more or receiving
                                                      more?
                                                      You can expect to see at least one question where the premiums are not given. What
                                                      you do know is the lower the strike price on a call, the higher the premium. Therefore,
                                                      in this example, it must be a debit spread because we would be paying more to buy
                                                      the 60 call than we would receive when selling the 65 call.


                                           Debit Call Spreads
                                           Bullish investors use debit call spreads to reduce the cost of a long option position. There is,
                                           however, a trade-off, because the investor’s potential reward is limited (as we will learn later in
                                           this unit).

                                 short 1 RST NOV 60 call at a premium of 3. Here is how this looks on a T-chart:
                                   DR         CR
                                   6
                                              3
                                   3
                       Instead of paying $600 to buy the call, the investor’s cost was reduced to $300 by also selling
                       a call.

                       Because this is a debit spread, the investor profits if exercise occurs. The difference in
                       premiums on the two options widens as exercise becomes likely. Investors always want net
                       debit spreads to widen.

                                 TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                 The following tips will be helpful with spread questions:
                                        debit = widen = exercise (When you begin to widen, you need to exercise.)
                                 This reminds you that debit spreads are profitable if the difference between the
                                 premiums widens or if the options are exercised. The test may ask you about which
                                 type of spread the investor wants the premiums to widen. Look for the debit spread.
                                        credit = narrow = expire (When you become too narrow, you may expire.)
                                 This reminds you that credit spreads are profitable if the difference between the
                                 premiums narrow or the options expire. This is logical because sellers want the
                                 options they write to expire, and option premiums decline as expiration approaches.
                                 In which type of spread does the investor want premiums to narrow? Look for the
                                 credit spread.

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 3.     An investor has established the following spread position. Long XYZ 50 call at 9 and
                                        short XYZ 60 call at 5. This investor will benefit if
                                         A. the options expire unexercised.
                                         B. the premiums widen.
                                         C. the premiums narrow.
                                         D. none of these.
                                        Answer: B. As we can see in the following T-chart, this is a debit spread and investors
                                        want the spread (difference) between the premiums to widen.

                                           Credit Call Spreads
                                           Bearish investors use credit call spreads to reduce the risk of a short option position. Look at
                                           this credit call (bear) spread.

                                                      EXAMPLE
                                                      An investor establishes a call spread by going long 1 TRS Nov 55 call for 2 and short 1
                                                      TRS Nov 45 call for 9.

                                                               7

                                           The T-chart shows us the difference between the money “in” (CR) and the money “out”
                                           (DR) is 7 points. The investor reduced the unlimited risk of being short a naked call by also
                                           purchasing a call. As we learned earlier, a short call is covered with a long call having a lower
                                           strike price and the same or longer expiration. The long call gives the investor the right to
                                           purchase the stock at 55 if forced to sell at 45. The investor in this situation is bearish. If the
                                           stock price declines below the lower strike price of 45, both options will expire worthless and
                                           the investor keeps the net premium.

                                           Because this is a credit spread, the investor profits when the options expire. The difference
                                           in premiums on the two options narrows as the options are about to expire. Investors always
                                           want net credit spreads to narrow.


                                           Put Spreads
                                           Debit put spreads are used by investors to reduce the cost of a long put position. The investor
                                           who establishes a debit put spread is bearish.

                                                      EXAMPLE
                                                      Buy 1 RST Nov 55 put for 6

                                                      want net debit spreads to widen or be exercised.

                       Credit Put Spreads
                       Bullish investors use credit put spreads to reduce the risk of a short put position.

                                 EXAMPLE
                                 Buy 1 RST Nov 55 put for 2
                                 Sell 1 RST Nov 65 put for 9

                       The investor reduced the substantial risk of the being short a naked put by also purchasing a
                       put. As we learned earlier, one of the ways to cover a short put is with a long put. The long
                       put gives the investor the right to sell stock if necessary to provide cash the investor needs
                       to buy stock when the short put is exercised. The investor in this situation is bullish. If the
                       stock price rises above the higher strike price of 65, both options will expire worthless and the
                       investor keeps the net premium.

                       This is a credit spread, so the investor profits when the options expire. The difference in
                       premiums on the two options narrows as the options are about to expire. Investors always
                       want net credit spreads to narrow.

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 4.     An investor who has entered into a debit spread will profit if
                                         A. the spread widens.
                                         B. the spread narrows.
                                         C. the spread remains unchanged.
                                         D. both contracts expire unexercised.
                                        Answer: A. The key to a debit spread is that the investor wants the options to be
                                        exercised or for the difference in premiums to widen.


                       Determining a Spread Investor’s Market Attitude (Bull or Bear)
                       The market attitude of a spread investor is determined by the option that is the more costly
                       of the two—the one with the higher premium.

                       For call spreads, the option contract with the lower strike price has the higher premium.
                       Whether the spread is a debit or credit spread will depend on if the investor purchased or sold
                       the option with the lower strike price.

                       It is a debit if the investor purchased the one with the lower strike price (higher premium). It
                       is a credit if the investor sold the one with the lower strike price (higher premium).

                                                     spreads are bearish.

                                           For put spreads, it is just the opposite. The option with the higher strike price has the higher
                                           premium. Whether the spread is a debit or credit spread depends on if the investor purchased
                                           or sold the option with the higher strike price.

                                           It is a debit if the investor purchased the one with the higher strike price (higher premium). It
                                           is a credit if the investor sold the one with the higher strike price (higher premium).

                                                     put spreads are bearish.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     You might see the term short spread instead of bear spread. That comes from the
                                                     concept that selling stock short is a bearish strategy.

                                                     You may be asked to determine whether a spread is bullish or bearish. Using the
                                                     premiums shown, use a T-chart to determine debit or credit. If no premiums are
                                                     shown, it is up to you to determine which of the options is more valuable. Expect to
                                                     see one or two questions on this concept.
                                                     A quick way to determine whether a spread is bullish or bearish is the following: in
                                                     any spread, put or call, if you are buying the lower strike price, you are a bull. Think of
                                                     it this way: “a bullish investor buys low and sells high.” Take the first letters of the key
                                                     words and you have BLSH (that even sounds bullish).

                                      Answer: A. Choices I and II are debit spreads. An investor wants a debit spread to
                                      widen. As the distance between the premiums increases, the investor’s potential
                                      profit also increases.



                       LO 10.f Recognize the strategies combining puts and calls.



                       Introduction
                       Our initial venture into advanced strategies involved using puts or calls, but not both in the
                       same transaction. Here, we are going to combine the two types of options.


                       Strategies Combining Puts and Calls
                       The exam will test on three different strategies using both puts and calls:
                        Straddles
                        Combinations
                        Collars


                       Straddles
                       A straddle is composed of a call and a put with the same exercise (strike) price and expiration
                       month. Straddles can be long or short and are used by investors to speculate on the price
                       movement of stock.




                                                                                                                                   Unit 10

                                                      TAKE NOTE
                                                      Like spreads, straddles can also be identified easily with the master options chart.
                                                      Straddles are identified by vertical ovals rather than horizontal ovals on the chart.
                                                                                     Straddles Chart
                                                      Straddles Chart
                                                                               Buy                  Sell




                                                        CALL




                                                        PUT



                                                                          Long Straddle        Short Straddle

                                                      The chart also provides a tip about the strategy behind straddles. Notice the market
                                                      attitude arrows pushing away from each other on the long straddle. This reminds you
                                                      that the investor who buys a straddle expects a large amount of movement in the price
                                                      of the stock.
                                                      The arrows on the short side are pointing toward each other. That signifies little or no
                                                      market price movement. That is the objective of the seller of the straddle.


                                           Long Straddles
                                           An investor who uses a long straddle expects substantial volatility in the stock’s price but is
                                           uncertain of the direction the price will move. To be ready for either occurrence, the investor
                                           purchases both a call and a put.

                                                      EXAMPLE
                                                      An investor establishes a long straddle position by going long 1 ABC JAN 50 call at 3
                                                      and going long 1 ABC JAN 50 put at 4.
                                           The investor has created a long straddle by purchasing a call and a put with the same strike
                                           price and expiration date. With a straddle, everything about the contracts are identical except
                                           that one is a put and the other a call. If the market price of the stock rises sufficiently, the call
                                           will be profitable and the put will expire.

                                           If the market price of the stock falls substantially instead, the put will be profitable and the
                                           call will expire. As long as the stock’s price moves, regardless of the direction, this investor can
                                           make money.

                       Short Straddles
                       An investor who writes a short straddle expects that the stock’s price will not change or will
                       change very little. The investor collects two premiums for selling a straddle.

                                  EXAMPLE
                                  An investor establishes a short straddle position by going short 1 XYZ FEB 45 call at 4
                                  and 1 XYZ FEB 45 put at 3.
                       The investor has created a short straddle by selling a call and a put with the same strike price
                       and expiration date. Just as with the long straddle, the contract terms are identical except that
                       one option is a put and the other a call. If the market price of the stock changes little or not at
                       all, the call and put will expire. The investor’s maximum profit is the two premiums collected.

                       If the market price of the stock rises or falls substantially, either the put or call will be
                       exercised against the investor. The investor’s maximum loss in this position is unlimited
                       because of the short naked call.


                       Combinations
                       A combination is composed of a call and a put with different strike prices, expiration
                       months, or both. Combinations are similar to straddles in strategy. Investors typically use
                       combinations because they are cheaper to establish than long straddles if both options are out
                       of the money.

                                  EXAMPLE
                                  An investor could establish a long combination by buying an XYZ Jan 40 call
                                  and buying an XYZ Jan 45 put. If the investor were to write both options, a short
                                  combination would result. As with straddles, the holder of a long combination makes
                                  money if the underlying stock price moves up or down far enough. The writer of a
                                  short combination makes money if the stock stays relatively stable.

                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                  6.   Your customer sells a DOH Mar 35 call. To establish a straddle, he would
                                        A. sell a DOH Mar 40 call.
                                        B. buy a DOH Mar 35 put.
                                        C. sell a DOH Mar 35 put.
                                        D. buy a DOH Mar 40 call.
                                       Answer: C. Straddles involve options of different types, but both options must be
                                       long or both must be short. They must have the same expiration date and strike
                                       price.

                                           Collars
                                           A collar is an option strategy generally used to protect an unrealized gain on a long stock
                                           position.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     An investor bought 1,000 shares of XYZ at $22 and the stock is now trading at $30. To
                                                     collar the stock, the customer could write an out of the money call and buy an out of
                                                     the money put. Here is what it would look like:
                                                     Long 1,000 XYZ now at $30
                                                         Write 10 XYZ 32.50 calls
                                                         Buy 10 XYZ 27.50 puts
                                                     With these options in place, the writer has collared the gain. If the stock were to
                                                     decline sharply, the writer can always sell the shares at $27.50 by exercising the puts.
                                                     If the stock were to rise sharply, the customer’s calls would be exercised and he would
                                                     then sell at $32.50. The investor has protected a profit (remember, the stock was
                                                     purchased at 22), but has limited the upside potential.
                                           A cashless collar is one where the premium received on the short call is the same amount or
                                           higher than the premium paid for the long put.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     The client is long 1,000 MNO at 50.

                                                         Buy 10 MNO Jan 45 puts at 4
                                           Because we have a 4-point credit and a 4-point debit, the collar is established with no out of
                                           pocket cash.

                                           Introduction
                                           Most of the exam questions will deal with equity options. There will be some on those
                                           known as nonequity options. In a few cases, the solutions are the same as with equity options.
                                           In others, they differ noticeably and we will point those out. The three types of nonequity
                                           options likely to be tested are
                                            index,
                                            interest rate, and
                                            foreign currency.

                      Index Options
                      Options on indexes allow investors to profit from the movements of markets or market
                      segments and hedge against these market swings. They may be based on broad-based, narrow-
                      based, or other indexes with a particular focus.

                      Broad-based indexes reflect movement of the entire market and include the S&P 100
                      (OEX), S&P 500, (SPX) and the Major Market Index (MMI) that mimics the Dow Jones 30
                      Industrial Average.

                      Narrow-based indexes track the movement of market segments in a specific industry, such as
                      technology or pharmaceuticals.


                      The Volatility Market Index (VIX)
                      Some indexes have a very particular focus, such as the Volatility Market Index (VIX).
                      This index is a measure of the implied volatility of the S&P 500 Index options traded
                      on the CBOE. VIX options, also traded on the CBOE, are designed to reflect investor
                      expectations of market volatility over the next 30 days. It is often referred to as the fear gauge
                      or index. High readings are not bullish, nor are they bearish, but instead are a measure of
                      the expectation (fear) that the market will be volatile. The expectation of greater volatility
                      generally translates into higher premiums for options contracts.

                      The VIX rises when put option buying increases and falls when more calls than puts are being
                      bought. Put buying is bearish, so when the “bears” are more active, market participants get
                      scared. On the other hand, call buying is bullish, so when the “bulls” are in command, anxiety
                      levels decrease.

                      Therefore, one could say that a higher VIX is a contrarian signal.

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 7.   A VIX option contract is based on the expected movements of
                                       A. the Dow Jones Industrial Average index (DJIA).
                                       B. the Standard & Poor’s 500 index (SPX).
                                       C. the Standard & Poor’s 100 index (OEX).
                                       D. the Dow Jones Utility index (DJU).
                                      Answer: B. A VIX option contract, often referred to as the fear index, is based on the
                                      expected movements of the Standard & Poor’s 500 index (SPX).


                      Index Option Features
                      Index options share many features with equity options. Let’s look at those along with a few
                      that are unique.


                      Premium Multiplier

                                                                                                                                  Unit 10
                      Index options typically use a multiplier of $100. The premium amount is multiplied by $100
                      to calculate the option’s cost, and the strike price is multiplied by $100 to determine the total
                      dollar value of the index. This is essentially the same as multiplying an equity option contract
                      by 100 shares.

                                                                        Index          Index              Cash Value

                                           Trading
                                           Purchases and sales of index options—like equity options—settle on the next business day.
                                           Index options stop trading at 4:15 pm ET if they are broad-based. Narrow-based index
                                           options stop trading at 4:00 pm ET.


                                           Exercise
                                           Unlike an equity option, the exercise of an index option settles in cash rather than in delivery
                                           of a security. Furthermore, settlement, if the option is exercised, requires the cash to be
                                           delivered on the next business day, (T+1). If the option is exercised, the writer of the option
                                           delivers cash equal to the intrinsic value of the option to the buyer. If an index option is in the
                                           money by 5 points, the owner of a put can exercise and receive $500 from the assigned seller.

                                                      PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                      8.   When an investor exercises an OEX option, she receives
                                                            A. common stock.
                                                            B. cash equal to the strike price.
                                                            C. cash equal to the intrinsic value.
                                                            D. nothing, because index options cannot be exercised.
                                                           Answer: C. Exercise settlement on index options is in cash, not stock. When the
                                                           owner of an option exercises, the person who has a short position must deliver cash
                                                           equal to the intrinsic value (the in the money amount). This is computed on the basis
                                                           of the closing value of the index on the day the option is exercised.


                                           Settlement Price
                                           When index options are exercised, their settlement price is based on the closing value of the
                                           index on the day of exercise, not the value at the time of exercise during the trading day.


                                           Expiration Dates
                                           Index options expire on the third Friday of the expiration month.

                                                      TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                      With regard to settlement, there are two major differences between index options and
                                                      equity options. The exercise of an index option settles the next business day, whereas
                                                      the exercise of an equity option settles the regular way (two business days). With
                                                      regard to trading (i.e., buying or selling), settlement is the next business day for both.
                                                      The other difference is that index options settle in cash rather than physical delivery.

                                 EXAMPLE
                                 A customer buys 1 OEX Jan 460 call at 3.20 when the OEX index is trading at 461.

                                 What is the premium?               $320 (3.20 × $100)


                                 What is the intrinsic value?       $100 (461 – 460)
                                 What is the time value?            $220 ($320 – $100)

                                 One month later, with the index at 472 and the Jan 460 call trading at 13.70, the
                                 customer elects to exercise.
                                 How much cash will the customer        $1,200, the intrinsic value of the option
                                 receive from the writer?               (472 – 460)
                                 How much profit did the                $880, which is the cash received from the
                                 customer make?                         writer less the premium paid ($1,200 – $320)
                                 Now, instead of exercising, assume the customer closes the position.
                                 How much profit would          $1,050, which is the difference between the premium
                                 the customer make?             received on selling ($1,370) and the premium paid to
                                                                open the position ($320)
                                                                Note that instead of making $880 by exercising, the
                                                                customer would have made $1,050 by closing the
                                                                position. Why the $170 difference? As long as there
                                                                is time value in the option, the customer will always
                                                                make more by closing an index option, (or any other
                                                                option), rather than by exercising. The time value of
                                                                the 460 call trading at 13.70 is $170 when the index
                                                                is at 472.

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 9.   An investor writes an OEX Oct 900 put at 5 when the OEX is at 902. If the OEX then
                                      closes at 890 and the put is exercised, how much cash must the writer pay to the
                                      holder of the put?
                                        A. $10
                                       B. $100
                                       C. $1,000
                                       D. $0; option is out of the money
                                      Answer: C. The put writer pays the holder 10 points worth of cash ($1,000) because
                                      the put is in the money by 10 points.


                       Index Options Strategy
                       Index options may be used to speculate on movement of the market overall. If an investor
                       believes the market will rise, she can purchase index calls or write index puts. If an investor
                       believes the market will fall, she can purchase index puts or write index calls.

                       Hedging a portfolio is an important use of index options. If a portfolio manager holds a                     Unit 10
                       diverse portfolio of equity, he can buy puts on the index to offset loss if the market value of
                       the stocks fall. This use of index puts is known as portfolio insurance. Index options protect
                       against the risk of a decline in the overall market. That risk is known as systematic risk and
                       will be covered in Unit 13.

                                                     A customer has a broad-based stock portfolio worth $920,000 and is concerned about
                                                     a possible market downturn. To hedge, the customer could buy broad-based index
                                                     puts (e.g., the OEX). If the market does turn downward, the loss on the portfolio would
                                                     be offset by a gain on the puts. Remember, a put increases in value as the underlying
                                                     security or portfolio goes down in value. If the OEX is trading at 460, each contract has
                                                     a value of $46,000 (460 × $100). Therefore, to hedge a $920,000 stock portfolio, the
                                                     customer would buy 20 OEX 460 puts (20 × $46,000 = $920,000).

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     Weekly index options contracts provide an efficient way to trade options around
                                                     certain news or events, such as economic data or earnings announcements. New
                                                     options series are listed on Thursday and expire the Friday of the following week.
                                                     Other than the expiration date and time to expiry, weeklies have the same contract
                                                     specifications as standard options.
                                           Portfolio managers may also choose to write index options to generate income.

                                                     PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                     10. Your client owns a portfolio of blue-chip stocks. She tells you she believes the
                                                         securities will provide good, long-term appreciation but also believes that the
                                                         market will decline over the short-term. Which index options strategy should you
                                                         recommend that will protect against the expected decline and still allow for long-
                                                         term capital appreciation?
                                                           A. Buy puts
                                                           B. Buy calls
                                                           C. Sell covered puts
                                                          D. Sell covered calls
                                                          Answer: A. Because your client is long stock, her position would be hurt by a drop
                                                          in the market. To hedge against that risk, she must take an option position that
                                                          appreciates in value as the market declines—long puts or short calls. Because your
                                                          client also wishes to benefit from any appreciation, the long put is the better hedging
                                                          vehicle. If the market averages increase, the put position will lose only the premium,
                                                          and your client could still gain on the portfolio.


                                           Interest Rate (Yield-Based) Options
                                           Interest rate options are yield-based (i.e., they have a direct relationship to movements in
                                           interest rates). These options are based on yields of T-bills, T-notes, and T-bonds. A yield-
                                           based option with a strike price of 35 reflects a yield of 3.5%. Assume an investor believes that
                                           rates on T-notes—currently at 3.5%—will rise in the near term. The investor could purchase
                                           a call option with a 35 strike price (at the money). If rates rise to 4.5%, the investor could
                                           exercise and receive cash equal to the intrinsic value of the option.

                                           Rates have gone up by 10 points—35 to 45—so the investor would receive $1,000 because
                                           each point is worth $100. Profit would be the $1,000 received on exercise less the premium
                                           paid. On the other hand, the investor could have closed her position, profiting from the
                                           difference between the premium paid and the premium received on closing.

                                           The strategy is straightforward. It is the Call UP/Put DOWN logic, only applied to interest
                                           rates rather than prices. If a portfolio manager believes rates will fall, the manager will buy

                                                                                                      Unit 10   Options     277


                       puts or write calls. If the manager believes rates will rise, buying calls and writing puts would
                       be appropriate.

                                 TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                 We don’t expect many questions on this topic. What can be confusing is it is the
                                 opposite of what you learned earlier (and will be tested heavily on) regarding bond
                                 prices and interest rates. Back in Lesson 4.1, we studied how bond prices fell as
                                 interest rates rose. Here, when interest rates rise, the value of a call option also goes
                                 up. The key is that yield-based options allow the investor to “bet” on the movement of
                                 interest rates, not prices.


                       General Characteristics of Yield-based Options
                       Yield-based options have a few characteristics in common with index options, such as
                        a contract size multiplier of $100 and
                        settlement is the next business day in cash rather than in delivery of the underlying secu­
                         rity.

                                 EXAMPLE
                                 An investor who believes interest rates are rising buys a yield-based call with a strike
                                 price of 65. Interest rates rise to 7.5%, and the investor receives, in cash, the difference
                                 between the strike price of 65 and the exercise settlement value of 75, times the
                                 multiplier of $100. Ten points × $100 = $1,000.
                                 An investor who is bearish on interest rates buys a yield-based put with a strike price
                                 of 75 for a premium of 3.5. Interest rates decline to 6.5%, and the investor receives, in
                                 cash, the dif­ference between the strike price of 75 and the exercise settlement value of
                                 65 (10 × $100 = $1,000).
                                 To calculate the investor’s profit, find the difference between the strike price and the
                                 exercise settlement value, and subtract the premium paid. The strike price is 75 and
                                 the exercise settlement value is 65, for a difference of 10. Multiply by $100 to find the
                                 amount received at settlement ($1,000), and subtract the premium paid ($350) to find
                                 the put buyer’s profit—$650.

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 11. When exercised, yield-based options settle on
                                      A. the exercise date plus three business days with the delivery of the underlying
                                         debt securities required.
                                      B. the exercise date plus three business days with the delivery of cash required.
                                      C. the exercise date plus one business day with the delivery of the underlying
                                         debt securities required.
                                      D. the exercise date plus one business day with the delivery of cash required.
                                      Answer: D. When exercised, yield-based debt options settle on the next business day
                                      in cash.

                                           When purchased, sold or exercised foreign currency options contracts are cash settled in U.S.
                                           dollars with no physical delivery of foreign currency.


                                           Contract Sizes
                                           Currency options contract sizes are small enough to accommodate retail investors. A British
                                           pound contract, for instance, covers 10,000 pounds. Each currency has its own contract size
                                           as follows:

                                                           Answer: D. These are called foreign currency options (FCOs) because they are only
                                                           available in the U.S. on foreign currencies.


                                           Strike Prices
                                           Strike prices of most FCOs are quoted in U.S. cents. The Japanese yen is an exception and is
                                           quoted in 1/100th of a cent.

                                                     Strike price of 85 = 85 U.S. cents ($0.85), except for Japanese yen, where a strike price
                                                     denoted as 121 = 1.21 U.S. cents (121 × 1/100).

                       Premiums
                       Currency options are quoted in cents per unit. Just as with equity options, one point of
                       premium = $100. The total premium of the contract is found by multiplying the premium by
                       the number of units. If a Swiss franc contract (10,000 units) is quoted with a premium of 1.5,
                       the cost of the contract is 10,000 × $0.015, or $150.

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 13. An investor purchases 2 Dec .56 Swiss franc calls at 2.5. One Swiss franc contract
                                     includes 10,000 units. How much does he pay for the position?
                                       A. $250
                                       B. $500
                                       C. $5,000
                                       D. $25,000
                                      Answer: B. Swiss francs options are quoted in cents per unit. One call at 2.5 cents
                                      multiplied by 10,000 units (0.025 × 10,000) equals $250. Because the investor has
                                      purchased 2 contracts, the total premium is $500.


                       Trading
                       Listed currency options are primarily traded on the Nasdaq OMX PHLX (formerly the
                       Philadelphia Stock Exchange). Trading hours are 9:30 am – 4:00 pm ET.


                       Expiration Date
                       Currency options expire on the third Friday of the expiration month just as equity options do.


                       Settlement
                       Currency options settle, like equity options, on the next business day. When a foreign
                       currency option is exercised, settlement occurs on the next business day as well. Delivery is
                       made in U.S. dollars.


                       Strategies
                       If an investor believes the value of a currency is going to rise, she will buy calls or sell puts
                       on the currency. If an investor expects the value of a currency to fall, she will buy puts or sell
                       calls on the currency. Currency options are measured relative to the U.S. dollar, and an inverse
                       relationship exists between their exchange rates. Therefore, if the U.S. dollar is rising relative
                       to other currencies, then those currencies are falling. Conversely, if the U.S. dollar is falling
                       against other currencies, then those currencies are rising.

                                 EXAMPLE
                                 A U.S. importer must pay for Swiss chocolates in Swiss francs within three months. The
                                 importer is fearful that the value of the dollar will fall. Using FCOs, what should this
                                 investor do?
                                                                                                                                       Unit 10
                                 If the importer believes the U.S. dollar will fall, then foreign currency values will rise.
                                 The investor should buy calls on the Swiss franc to lock in the purchase price for the
                                 francs needed in three months.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     As a rule, importers buy calls on the foreign currency to hedge; exporters buy puts to
                                                     hedge. We call that the EPIC rule, (exporters buy puts; importers buy calls).However,
                                                     keep in mind that there are no options available on the U.S. dollar. As an example,
                                                     consider a Japanese company that exports stereos to the United States. The company
                                                     will be paid in dollars upon delivery. The risk to the Japanese company is that the
                                                     dollar will decline between now and the delivery, which means $1 will be worth fewer
                                                     yen. How should this company hedge this risk?
                                                     The rule of thumb is that exporters should buy puts on the foreign currency. However,
                                                     because there are no options on the U.S. dollar, the Japanese company should buy
                                                     calls on its own currency, the yen. In other words, EPIC works in reverse if the question
                                                     is dealing with a foreign company. Then it is IPEC.

                                                     PRACTICE QUESTIONS
                                                     14. A British company is exporting sweaters to the United States. How should the
                                                         company hedge its foreign exchange risk?
                                                          A. Buy BP calls
                                                          B. Sell BP calls
                                                          C. Buy BP puts
                                                          D. Sell BP puts
                                                         Answer: A. Because options on the U.S. dollar are not available, exporters to the
                                                         United States should buy calls on their own currency. Had this been a U.S. company
                                                         exporting to England, it would buy BP puts.

                                                         Answer: A. All options trading on U.S. exchanges, including FCOs, settle in U.S.
                                                         dollars.


           LESSON 10.6: OPTIONS MATH
                                           LO 10.h Calculate profit/loss and breakeven for the various strategies.



                                           Introduction
                                           The exam will have a number of questions dealing with options calculations. Those will deal
                                           with maximum gain, maximum loss, and breakeven points. They take a bit of practice, but
                                           once you have the concept down, they are quite simple.

                                           Options contracts may have various characteristics that are unique to the options market­place.
                                           Some terms used to describe options contracts—such as in the money, at the money, out of the
                                           money, intrinsic value, and breakeven—have meanings that are specific to options trading. In
                                           case you don’t remember our coverage of in, at, and out of the money, you might want to go
                                           back to Lesson 10.2 and review.

                                                                                                      Unit 10   Options     281


                       Breakeven
                       The breakeven point is the point at which the investor neither makes nor loses money. It is
                       expressed in terms of a price of the underlying asset.


                       Breakeven—Call Options
                       In the case of calls, the breakeven is the strike price plus the premium (Call UP). For the
                       call buyer, the contract is profitable above the breakeven. For the call seller, the contract is
                       profitable below the breakeven.

                                  TAKE NOTE
                                  An option that is in the money is not necessarily at breakeven. Options that are in the
                                  money are not always profitable.

                                  TAKE NOTE
                                  These concepts are applicable whether the contract is long or short. The words Call
                                  UP will help you remember the call concept. A call has intrinsic value (or is in the
                                  money) when the market price of the underlying asset is up above the strike price of
                                  the option, whether it is long or short. Also, the call breakeven is up above the op­tion’s
                                  strike price (strike price + premium).


                       Breakeven—Put Options
                       In the case of puts, the breakeven is the strike price of the option minus the premium (Put
                       DOWN). For the put buyer, the contract is profitable below the breakeven. For the put seller,
                       the contract is profitable above the breakeven.

                                  TAKE NOTE
                                  These concepts are applicable whether the contract is long or short. The words Put
                                  DOWN will help you remember put definitions. A put has intrin­sic value (or is in the
                                  money) when the market price of the underlying security is down below the strike
                                  price, regardless whether a position is long or short. Also, the put breakeven is down
                                  below the strike price (strike price – premium).

                                  EXAMPLE
                                  Put definitions are the opposite of what they are for calls. Options are a game of
                                  opposites. Calls are opposites of puts, and buyers are opposites of sellers.
                                  The following table summarizes the basic definitions for calls and puts.
                                  CMV = Current Market Value SP = Strike Price

                                              arrows represent bearish investors.
                                             Information in parentheses identifies what occurs at exercise of the option.
                                             The solid horizontal line represents the strike price.

                                             Puts are below the horizontal line because they are in the money when the market price is
                                              below the strike price, long or short (put down).


                                            Breakeven—Spreads
                                            Finding the breakeven point on a spread uses the same Call UP and Put DOWN formula.
                                            With 2 calls or 2 puts, the trick is knowing which strike price to use. In the case of a call
                                            spread, the net credit or debit is always added to the lower strike price. In the case of a put
                                            spread, you always subtract the net credit or debit from the higher strike price. As you do
                                            questions, you will notice that the breakeven point is always a number between the two strike
                                            prices.

                                EXAMPLE
                                An investor establishes a call spread by going long 1 RST NOV 55 Call at a premium of 6
                                and short 1 RST NOV 60 call at a premium of 3 (this should look familiar—we set it up a
                                couple of lessons ago). What is the breakeven point?
                                  DR     CR
                                  6

                                  3
                                As you can see, there is a net debit of 3 points. The breakeven on a call spread is
                                always found by adding the debit (or credit) to the lower strike price. In this case, the
                                lower strike is 55. We add the 3 point debit to 55 and the breakeven point is 58. We
                                know for sure that we don’t add to the 60 because that would give us a breakeven of
                                63. On a spread, the breakeven point is always between the strike prices—in this case
                                between 55 and 60.
                                Let us try another one.
                                An investor establishes a call spread by going long 1 RST NOV 55 Call at a premium of 3
                                and short 1 RST NOV 50 call at a premium of 7.
                                If we use the T-chart, we see that 3 points goes out (a debit) and 7 points comes in (a
                                credit). That gives us a net credit of 4 points. This is a credit call spread. The breakeven
                                is determined by adding the net credit to the lower strike price. That would be 50 +
                                4 giving the investor a breakeven point of 54. Once again, you notice this is between
                                strike prices of 50 and 55.
                       How about a couple of put spreads?

                                EXAMPLE
                                An investor establishes a put spread by going long 1 RST NOV 55 put at a premium of 6
                                and short 1 RST NOV 50 put at a premium of 3.
                                  DR     CR
                                  6
                                         3
                                  3

                                Note that we purchased the put with the higher strike price (the more you can put
                                the stock for, the higher the premium) and that made this a debit spread. On a put
                                spread, the breakeven follows the Put DOWN rule. We take the net debit (or credit) and
                                subtract it from the higher strike price. In this case, we subtract the 3 point net debit
                                from the strike of 55 and have a breakeven point of $52. As a debit put spread, this is a
                                bearish strategy and the investor profits when the price goes below breakeven.

                                EXAMPLE
                                An investor establishes a put spread by going long 1 QED DEC 55 put at a premium of 2
                                and short 1 QED DEC 65 put at a premium of 9.

                                                     By selling the more valuable option, (the one with the higher strike price), the investor
                                                     created a credit spread. As we see, the net credit is 7 points. The breakeven for this
                                                     bullish spread follows the Put DOWN method and is 65 – 7, or 58. As is always the case
                                                     with spreads, the breakeven point is somewhere in between the two strike prices.


                                           Breakeven—Straddles and Combinations
                                           This looks a bit different, but is really the same: Call UP and Put DOWN. There are two
                                           breakeven points because there are two options. The breakeven for the call is the strike price
                                           plus both premiums paid. The breakeven for the put is the strike price minus both premiums
                                           paid. A couple of examples should help make this clear. Remember, when you are long a
                                           straddle, you want the stock’s price to move up or down. It has to move enough to get past the
                                           breakeven in order for the investor to make money.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     An investor establishes a long straddle by going long 1 ABC JAN 50 call at a premium
                                                     of 3 and long 1 ABC JAN 50 put at a premium of 4.
                                                     Because the investor has purchased both options, there is an investment cost of 7
                                                     points. The breakevens are the call strike plus the 7 points and the put strike minus the
                                                     7 points. That gives us 57 and 43. The stock’s price will have to go above 57 or below
                                                     43 for this investor to profit. Of course, if it stays within that range, the seller is the
                                                     winner.
                                           We will visit a few more of these as we move on to maximum gain and loss computations.


                                           Breakeven—Index Options
                                           Breakeven follows the Call UP and Put DOWN rule, but it helps to see an example.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     A customer buys 1 OEX Jan 460 call at 3.20 when the OEX index is trading at 461.

                                                     What is the premium?               $320 (3.20 × $100)
                                                     What is the breakeven point?       463.20 (strike price + premium)
                                                     What is the intrinsic value?       $100 (461 – 460)
                                                     What is the time value?            $220 ($320 – $100)

                                                     One month later, with the index at 472 and the Jan 460 call trading at 13.70, the
                                                     customer elects to exercise.
                                                     How much cash will the customer          $1,200, the intrinsic value of the option
                                                     receive from the writer?                 (472 – 460)
                                                     How much profit did the customer         $880, which is the cash received from the
                                                     make?                                    writer less the premium paid ($1,200 – $320)

                                                     Instead of exercising, assume the customer closes the position.
                                                     How much profit would          $1,050, which is the difference between the premium

                                                                                    open the position ($320)

                       Note that instead of making $880 by exercising, the customer would have made $1,050 by
                       closing the position. Why the $170 difference? As long as there is time value in the option,
                       the customer will always make more by closing an index option rather than by exercising. The
                       time value of the 460 call trading at 13.70 is $170 when the index is at 472.


                       Maximum Gains and Losses
                       Investors who open an option position should understand the following three scenarios: the
                       maximum amount they can gain, the maximum amount they can lose, and the point at which
                       the investment will break even. We have already discussed breakeven so we will move ahead to
                       gains and losses.


                       Long Calls
                       Maximum gain
                       As stock prices rise above the breakeven point, the potential gain on a call option generally
                       increases point for point with the stock’s value. Theoretically, the potential gains available to
                       call owners are unlimited because a rise in stock price is unlimited.


                       Maximum loss
                       On a long call, investors risk losing 100% of the premium paid, which happens when the
                       stock’s market price is at or below the option’s exercise price at expiration, making the option
                       worthless. Just as with any security, when you buy something, the most you can lose is what
                       you pay for it.


                       Short Calls
                       Maximum gain
                       Bearish call writers anticipate that the stock’s price will drop. If it drops below the exercise
                       price by the expiration date, the call will be worthless to the buyer and will expire unexercised.
                       The writer then keeps the entire premium, with no further risk ex­posure. No matter how low
                       the stock price falls (even if it drops to zero), the writer’s gain is limited to the amount of the
                       premium originally received.


                       Maximum loss
                       The greatest risk assumed by call writers is that a call they wrote will be assigned and they will
                       have to deliver stock they do not own. If the option is uncovered (naked), the potential loss is
                       unlimited. If a naked call writer has to go out into the open market to buy the stock, he may
                       end up paying a price much higher than the option’s exercise price. As the stock price rises,
                       so does the call seller’s potential loss. If he decides to enter a closing purchase, he can stop
                       his losses from increasing. Otherwise, there is no theoretical limit on his potential loss. If the
                       call is covered, the loss is limited based on the writer’s cost of the underlying stock and the

                                                                                                                                  Unit 10

                                                     PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                     16. An investor buys 100 shares of CDL stock at $50. Two months later, with CDL selling
                                                         for $48, the investor writes a CDL APR 45 call for a premium of $4. If the option is
                                                         exercised, the investor’s maximum potential loss is

                                                          Answer: B. The investor paid $5,000 for the stock and received a premium of $4. That
                                                          means the net cost of the position is $4,600. Regardless of how high the price of CDL
                                                          goes, when assigned an exercise notice, the investor will deliver the stock currently
                                                          owned and receive the strike price of 45, or $4,500. That results in a loss of $100.

                                                     17. An investor selling 1 KLP Dec 45 call at 3 has a maximum potential gain of
                                                          A. $300.

                                                          Answer: A. The maximum gain on a short call is equal to the premium received by
                                                          the seller. One contract represents 100 shares, and the seller received a $3 per share
                                                          premium. 100 × $3 = $300.


                                           Long Puts
                                           Maximum gain
                                           The typical put buyer is bearish, and the maximum gain will occur when the price of the
                                           underlying stock reaches the lowest possible market price, which is zero. If an investor could
                                           buy the stock for no money, she could sell it at the strike price by exercising the option. This
                                           gain would be reduced by the premium paid in the opening transaction.


                                           Maximum loss
                                           A put buyer’s maximum potential loss is the premium he paid. On all long options, the
                                           investor pays (and risks) the premium. The worst that can happen to a put buyer is that his
                                           option expires before it is worth exercising, which can occur at any market price at or above
                                           the strike price.

                       Short Puts
                       Maximum gain
                       The writer of a put receives a premium in the opening transaction. His greatest potential gain
                       is the premium. When the stock price is at or above the exercise price, the put has no intrinsic
                       value and will not be exercised by the holder. If the stock price stays at or above the exercise
                       price, the put will expire worthless and the writer will keep the pre­mium.


                       Maximum loss
                       A put seller’s maximum potential loss occurs if the stock price drops to zero. In this case, the
                       put owner will exercise the option. The put seller will have to take de­livery of the stock, and
                       because it has no market value, she is out the exercise price minus the premium received in
                       the opening transaction.

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 While breakeven is the same number for both put buyers and sellers (strike price – pre­
                                 mium), consider that put buyers (bearish) want to see the underlying stock below the
                                 breakeven to be profitable, while put sellers (bullish) want to see the stock above the

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 18. If an investor buys 1 ALF Jan 50 put at 2, the maximum potential gain is
                                       A. $200.
                                       B. $4,800.
                                       C. $5,200.
                                       D. unlimited.
                                      Answer: B. The maximum gain on a long put is calculated by subtracting the
                                      premium paid from the strike price. Subtract the premium of 2 from the strike price of
                                      50 and multiply by the number of shares to determine the maximum potential gain.
                                      Because a contract represents 100 shares, the buyer’s maximum gain is $4,800.


                       Spreads
                       Calculating the maximum gain, loss, and breakeven on spreads will appear on several
                       questions on the exam. We will begin by reviewing a few key points:
                        If it is a debit spread, the investor wants the difference between the premiums to widen. If
                         they widen enough, the options will be exercised and the investor will profit.
                        If it is a credit spread, the investor wants the difference between the premiums to narrow.

                                                                                                                                   Unit 10
                         If they narrow to zero, the options will expire and the investor will profit.
                        The breakeven point is always somewhere between the two strike prices.
                        When the underlying asset’s price moves beyond the breakeven point, the investor begins
                         to profit.

                                            In finding breakeven points on spreads, remember CAL and PSH:
                                             – For Call spreads: Add the net premium to the Lower SP.
                                               –    For Put spreads: Subtract the net premium from the Higher SP.


                                           Debit Call Spreads
                                           Maximum gain
                                           An investor establishing a debit call spread is bullish. That is because the option purchased has
                                           the low strike and the one sold has the high strike. Buy low and sell high (BLSH) is a bullish
                                           strategy. If the market price of the underlying asset reaches or goes above the higher strike
                                           price, the investor’s gain is maximized. Here is an example of what this means.

                                                      EXAMPLE
                                                      An investor establishes a debit call spread by going long 1 RST NOV 55 for a premium
                                                      of 6 and short 1 RST NOV 60 call for a premium of 3.
                                                       DR      CR
                                                       6
                                                               3
                                                       3
                                                      We see in our T-chart that the debit is 3 points. What happens if the stock price goes
                                                      to $60? The long 55 call is 5 points in the money. It can either be exercised at 55 and
                                                      the stock sold at 60 or sold for its intrinsic value. In either case, there is a profit of $5
                                                      per share. The short 60 call expires [there is no point in calling (exercising) stock at 60
                                                      when the market price is 60.]
                                                      If we were to enter this on the T-chart, we would see a credit of 5. That would make the
                                                      total credits 8 and that means the spreader made a 2 point gain.
                                           Using this example, what if the stock’s price goes to 70? After all, this investor is bullish and
                                           the higher the better, right? Not really so for a spread position. At 70, the long 55 call is 15
                                           points in the money and, at expiration, could be sold for that amount. But, the 60 call the
                                           investor is short is 10 points in the money and will surely be exercised. The spreader uses the
                                           stock purchased at 55 to deliver against the exercise of the short call and receives 60.

                                           That spread, the difference between the two exercise prices, never changes. Regardless of how
                                           high the price of the underlying stock goes, there is always that 5 point difference and that
                                           limits the investor’s gain to the difference between the debit paid and the strike price spread.
                                           In this example, with a debit of 3 and a price spread of 5 points, the most this investor can
                                           ever make is 2 points, (5 – 3).


                                           Maximum loss
                                           The maximum loss in any debit spread is the debit. In our example, the spread was established
                                           at a cost of 3. If the stock’s price falls, the most this investor can lose is the 3 points paid. Both
                                           options expire worthless.

                                      Answer: B. The first step is to compute the debit (or credit). In this case, the long
                                      option cost 8 while the short option brought in 2.75. That is a 5.25 debit. The
                                      maximum gain is $475. The maximum gain on a debit spread is the difference
                                      between the strike prices minus the net debit: 10 – 5.25 = 4.75; 4.75 × 100 shares =
                                      $475. The maximum loss is $525. The maximum loss on a debit spread is the net
                                      debit. Notice that the maximum gain and maximum loss always add up to the
                                      spread.


                       Debit Put Spreads
                       A bearish investor who establishes a debit put spread buys the put with the higher strike price
                       and sells the put with the lower strike price. A put with a higher strike price will be worth
                       more to investors (and will have a higher premium) than a put with a lower strike price, so
                       more money will be flowing out of the account (for the put pur­chased) than will be flowing
                       into the account (from the put sold).

                       A bearish investor buys a put or put spread expecting that the price of the underlying stock
                       will fall. If it does, he can exercise the long put of the spread (the one with the higher strike
                       price) and sell stock above the current market price. If the short put (the one with the lower
                       strike price) is exercised, he will have to buy the stock, but by having exercised the option he
                       owns, he keeps the difference between the strike prices less the net debit. As with single option
                       strategies, the investor can close out his option positions and keep the profits (or take the
                       losses) rather than exercise.


                       Maximum gain
                       Debit put spreaders will realize their maximum gain any time the stock’s market price is at
                       or below the strike price of the lower option. At that point, they will have to buy stock at the
                       low strike price, but they can sell the stock at the higher strike price and keep the difference
                       between the two prices, minus the net premium (net debit).


                       Maximum loss
                       If the stock’s price rises to or above the strike price of the higher option, both puts will expire
                       worthless. No investor will exercise a put when the stock can be sold in the market for more

                                                                                                                                      Unit 10
                       than the strike price of the option. At any price above the higher strike price, the investor will
                       sustain the maximum loss because both puts will expire worth­less. The general rule is that the
                       maximum loss on a debit spread is the net premium (net debit). The maximum gain is the
                       difference in strike prices less the net debit (maximum loss).

                                                      EXAMPLE
                                                      An investor establishes a spread by going long 1 AAJ NOV 90 put at 7 and short 1 AAJ
                                                      NOV 80 put at 2.

                                                       5

                                                      The maximum gain is $500, which will occur if the stock is at 80 or below. In this
                                                      instance, both contracts will be exercised. The investor will be forced to buy at 80 but
                                                      holds the right to sell at 90 for a $1,000 gain. The gain on the stock is reduced by the
                                                      net premium paid of $500. Therefore, maximum potential gain is $500. The maxi­
                                                      mum loss is $500, which will occur if, at expiration, the stock is at 90 or above. In this
                                                      instance, both contracts will expire worthless and the investor will lose the net debit of
                                                      $500.
                                                      Breakeven occurs at 85 (90 – 5). At this price, the investor will exercise the 90 put for a
                                                      $500 gain (which offsets the net debit exactly). Below 85, the customer makes money,
                                                      up to a maximum of $500. Above 85, the customer loses money, up to a maximum of
                                                      $500.


                                           Credit Call Spreads
                                           Bearish investors establish credit call spreads. To do so, they buy the call with the higher strike
                                           price and sell the call with the lower strike price. The call with a higher strike price will have
                                           a lower premium than the call with a lower strike price, so the investor will be paying out less
                                           money for the purchase than she is taking in from the sale. When more money flows into an
                                           account than out, there is a net credit.

                                           Bearish investors sell calls and call spreads because they expect the underlying stock’s price
                                           to go down. If it does, both options will expire worthless and the investor may keep the net
                                           premium (the net credit).

                                           If the investor is wrong and the stock goes up, the long option can be exercised to buy the
                                           stock, which then must be delivered against the short option. The investor will lose the differ­
                                           ence between the two strike prices, less the net credit. The investor can close out the positions
                                           and keep the profits (or take the losses) rather than exercise.


                                           Maximum gain
                                           The maximum gain on a credit call spread, as with any position estab­lished for a credit, is the
                                           net premium, (the net credit). The maximum gain will occur when the stock price is at or
                                           below the lower strike price.


                                           Maximum loss
                                           The maximum loss on a credit call spread is the difference between strike prices less the net
                                           premium. This occurs when the stock’s price is at or above the higher strike price.


                                           Breakeven
                                           The breakeven point is the lower strike price plus the net premium.

                                  EXAMPLE
                                  An investor establishes a spread position by going long 1 AAJ AUG 65 call for a
                                  premium of 1 and short 1 AAJ AUG 60 call for a premium of 3.

                                  On a credit spread, the maximum gain is always the net credit. In this example, the
                                  maximum gain is $200. This will occur if the stock is at 60 or below. In this instance,
                                  both contracts will expire worthless and the investor will keep the net credit.
                                  The maximum loss is $300, which will occur if the stock is at 65 or above. In this
                                  instance, both contracts will be exercised. The investor will buy at 65 and be forced to
                                  sell at 60 for a $500 loss. The loss is offset by the $200 credit received, which re­sults in
                                  an overall loss of $300 (the difference in strike prices less the net credit).
                                  Breakeven occurs at 62 (60 + 2). At 62, the customer will be exercised on the 60 call
                                  and be forced to sell, at 60, stock that cost him 62, resulting in a $200 loss on the stock.
                                  This amount is offset exactly by the $200 net credit received. Above 62, the customer
                                  loses money, up to a maximum of $300. Below 62, the customer makes money, up to a
                                  maximum of $200.


                       Credit Put Spreads
                       Bullish investors establish credit put spreads. They buy the put with the lower strike price and
                       sell the put with the higher strike price. The put with the lower strike price will have a lower
                       premium than the put with the higher strike price, so the inves­tor will be spending less money
                       on the option with the low strike price than he is taking in on the sale of the option with the
                       higher strike price.

                       Bullish investors sell puts and put spreads expecting the stock’s price to go up. If it does, both
                       options will expire worthless and the investor will keep the net premium.

                       If the investor is wrong and the stock price goes down below the lower strike price, the
                       investor will have to buy the stock at the high strike price but can then exercise the other put
                       with the lower price to sell the stock. The investor will lose the difference between the strike
                       prices, less the net credit. The investor can close out the positions and keep the profits (or take
                       the losses) rather than exercise.


                       Maximum gain
                       The maximum gain on a credit put spread is the net premium (net credit), which occurs when
                       the stock price is at or above the higher strike price.

                       Maximum loss
                       The maximum loss on a credit put spread is the difference between strike prices minus the net                    Unit 10
                       premium, which occurs when the stock’s market price is at or below the lower strike price.

                       Breakeven
                       The breakeven point on a put spread is the higher strike price minus the net premium.

                                           The maximum gain is $700, which will occur if, at expiration, the stock is at 40 or above. In
                                           this instance, both contracts will expire worthless and the customer will keep the net premium
                                           (net credit) of $700.

                                           The maximum loss is $300, which will occur if, at expiration, the stock is at 30 or below. In
                                           this instance, both contracts will be exercised; the customer will buy at 40 and exercise his
                                           right to sell at 30. The $1,000 loss on the stock is offset by the $700 credit received, which
                                           results in an overall loss of $300.

                                           Breakeven occurs at 33 (40 – 7). At 33, the customer will be assigned and forced to buy stock
                                           at 40 that is worth 33. This $700 loss is offset exactly by the net credit received. Above 33, the
                                           customer begins to profit, up to a maximum of $700. Below 33, the customer begins to lose,
                                           up to a maximum of $300.


                                           Closing Positions—Gains and Losses
                                           Remember, with spreads, it is the premiums of the two options that changes, not the strike
                                           prices. All of our examples thus far have assumed gain or loss at expiration date. At that point,
                                           at least for exam purposes, all options are only worth intrinsic value; there is no time value.

                                           Instead of waiting until expiration, investors can close out their spread positions at any time.
                                           That is, they sell their long position (closing sale) and buy back the short position (closing
                                           purchase). A debit spread is profitable if it can be closed out at a greater credit than the initial
                                           debit. That is, the spread between the sale price of the long and the purchase price covering
                                           the short must be greater (wider) than the initial debit. That is why we say that investors with
                                           debit spreads want the spread between premiums to widen.

                                           A credit spread will be profitable when the difference to close out the short position (closing
                                           purchase) and the long position (closing sale) is a smaller debit than the initial credit when
                                           the position was opened. That is why investors with credit spreads want the spread to narrow.
                                           These sound a bit confusing at first, but a few examples here (and questions in the q-bank)
                                           will help you get on the right path.

                                                      EXAMPLE
                                                      An investor establishes a spread position buy going long 1 XYZ JAN 70 call at a
                                                      premium of 3 and going short 1 XYZ JAN 60 call at a premium of 9. Immediately, we
                                                      see that the premium for the option sold is greater than that for the one purchased.
                                                      That tells us this is a credit spread. The T-chart confirms this:

                                 A month before expiration date, XYZ is trading at $64 per share. If the stock were to fall
                                 to $59, the premiums on both contracts would fall. At that price, they are out of the
                                 money. Assume the premium on the 60 call is now 5 and the premium on the 70 call is
                                 now 1 (it is now trading at a $4 credit).
                                 If the customer closes both positions, the customer would have a $200 profit. On the
                                 T-chart, we close the 60 call with a purchase at 5 and the 70 call with a sale at 1.
                                  DR      CR

                                 The net is a credit of 2 points or $200 profit. The spread between the premiums
                                 narrowed from the original 6 points to 4 points (5 minus 1) and that gave the investor
                                 a $200 profit. If both options expire worthless, then the spread is zero and the investor
                                 makes the entire $600. If the spread widens (the stock price rises), the investor could
                                 lose the balance of the spread (10 minus 6) or $400. Let’s look at another example.

                                 EXAMPLE
                                 With PRS common stock selling at 34, an investor establishes a spread by going long 1
                                 PRS JAN 30 call at 8 and short 1 PRS JAN 40 call at 3. If the price of PRS goes to 39 and
                                 the premium of the 30 call rises to 13 and that of the 40 call to 5, what is the investor’s
                                 profit or loss if both positions are closed at the current prices?
                                 We notice this is a debit spread because the investor is paying more than receiving.
                                 The T-chart confirms that.
                                  DR      CR
                                  8
                                          3
                                  5

                                 There are two ways to answer the question. The quickest is to remember that investor
                                 with debit spreads want the premium spread to widen. The difference between the
                                 premiums is now 8 points (13 – 5). By widening from 5 to 8, the investor’s profit is 3
                                 points ($300).
                                 Or, by using the T-chart, we have the 30 closed at 13 (13 into the credit column) and
                                 the 40 closed at 5 (put 5 into the debit column). The totals now are 13 debit (money
                                 out) and 16 credit (money in) for a profit of 3 points ($300).

                                  13      16

                       How about trying one with a credit spread.

                                                     PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                     20. An investor establishes a spread by going long 1 DEF FEB 60 put at 3 and short 1 DEF
                                                         FEB 70 put at 7. Before expiration, DEF is selling for 68 and both positions are closed
                                                         out at their intrinsic value. As a result, the investor has
                                                          A. a loss of $200.
                                                          B. a gain of $200.
                                                          C. a loss of $600.
                                                          D. a gain of $600.
                                                         Answer: B. Using the T-chart, we see this is a credit spread with a net credit of $400.
                                                         With the price of DEF at $68, the 60 put is out of the money and would be closed by a
                                                         sale at zero. The 70 put is 2 points in the money and the closing purchase at intrinsic
                                                         value would cost $200. As the premium spread has narrowed from 4 points to 2
                                                         points, the investor made $200.

                                                           DR     CR

                                                         As a bull spread, if the DEF reached 70 or higher, both options would expire
                                                         unexercised and the entire 4 points would be profit to the investor. On the other
                                                         hand, if DEF’s price drops to 60, the 70 put would be exercised at a 10-point loss
                                                         which, once subtracting the initial 4-point credit, would give this investor a net loss of
                                                         $600. But, we knew that would be the maximum loss because, with a maximum gain
                                                         of 4 of the 10-point difference between 60 and 70, the maximum loss is the rest of the
                                                         spread.

                                           Here is a question similar in format to one that is frequently used on the exam.

                                                     PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                     21. An investor establishes a spread position by going long 1 GHI 30 MAR call and short 1
                                                         GHI 35 MAR call. The investor will profit if
                                                            I. the spread narrows.
                                                           II. the spread widens.
                                                          III. GHI is at 30 or below.
                                                          IV. GHI is at 35 or above.
                                                           A. I and III

                                                           D. II and IV
                                                         Answer: D. This is a bull call spread. We know that because the investor bought
                                                         the lower strike price and sold the higher strike price. Buy low, sell high (BLSH) is
                                                         bullish. We also know that this is a debit spread. We can tell even though there are no
                                                         premiums shown. We know that because when it is call options, the lower the strike,
                                                         the higher the premium. Regardless of the numbers, the premium to buy a 30 call will
                                                         always be higher than the premium received from selling a 35 call.

                                                         Bull spreads benefit when the price goes up. The investor’s maximum profit is
                                                         reached when the stock is at 35 (or higher). As a debit spread, we want the premium
                                                         spread to widen.

                       Straddles and Combinations
                       The maximum gain of the long straddle is unlimited because the potential gain on a long call
                       is unlimited. The maximum loss of the long straddle is both premiums paid. There are two
                       breakeven points because there are two options. The breakeven for the call is the strike price
                       plus both premiums paid; the breakeven for the put is strike price minus both premiums paid.
                       The investor does not experience profit unless the market price is above the breakeven of the
                       call or below the breakeven of the put.

                                 EXAMPLE
                                 An investor establishes a long straddle by going long 1 ABC Jan 150 call at 5 and long 1
                                 ABC Jan 150 put at 6. What is the maximum gain, loss and breakeven points?
                                      maximum gain = unlimited
                                      maximum loss = $1,100
                                      breakevens = 161, 139 (150 + 11; 150 – 11)
                       Let’s look at an example of a short combination.

                                 With XYZ trading at 25, a customer writes 1 XYZ Jan 20 call at 6 and writes 1 XYZ Jan
                                 30 put at 7. This is an example of a short combination where both contracts are in the
                                 money. Both the call and the put are in the money by 5 points. The exam could ask
                                 you the following question:
                                 Just before expiration, with XYZ now trading at 27, the customer closes his positions at
                                 intrinsic value. How much did the customer make or lose?
                                 In this example, closing means buying back the original two options sold. What will be
                                 the cost of buying back both options? The answer is their intrinsic value. With XYZ now
                                 at 27, the call is in the money by 7 points and the put is in the money by 3 points. Now
                                 it is just a simple computation. The call was sold for 6 and bought back for 7, a loss of
                                 $100. The put was sold for 7 and bought back for 3, a gain of $400. Overall, the gain is
                                 $300. Another way to come up with the same result is to note that the position opened
                                 with a credit of 13 (6 + 7). It is closed with a debit of 10 (7 + 3) for a gain of $300.
                                 The maximum gain is the total credit minus the difference in strike prices. That is 13
                                 – 10 = 3 points. In a short combination, the investor makes money if the stock stays
                                 inside the breakeven points. Those follow the Call UP and Put DOWN rule and are 20
                                 +13 (33) and 30 – 13 (17). Once the stock goes above 33 or below 17, the investor will
                                 lose money.
                                 The maximum loss is unlimited because of the short call.


                       Options Hedge Positions
                       As mentioned earlier in this unit, options can be used to hedge (protect) a long or a short
                       position. The computation of the breakeven point does not follow the Call UP and Put

                                                                                                                                   Unit 10
                       DOWN rule when the question deals with stock and an option.


                       Long Stock, Long Put (Protective Put)
                       An investor buys 100 shares of RST at 53 and buys an RST 50 put for 2 as protection. Should
                       the stock price fall below the strike price of 50, the investor will exercise the put to sell the
                       stock for 50. In this scenario, the investor loses $3 per share on the stock and has spent $2 per



Series_7_2E.indb 295                                                                                                   11/19/2021 7:53:10 PM

                                           share for the put. The total loss equals $500. The breakeven point is reached when the stock
                                           rises by the amount paid for the put; in this case, 53 + 2 = 55.

                                           In this example, no matter how far the stock falls, the investor can get out at 50 by exercising
                                           the put. Therefore, the most the investor can lose on the stock position is $3 per share. The
                                           cost of this protection is $2 per share. Therefore, maximum potential loss is $5 per share,
                                           or $500. On the other hand, maximum gain is unlimited because the stock price could rise
                                           infinitely. To break even, the stock must rise by the cost of the put option purchased. The
                                           breakeven point for long stock-long put is the cost of stock purchased plus premium. In our
                                           example, the breakeven is $55.

                                                      TAKE NOTE
                                                      Protective put strategies are most often employed with equity positions, as in the
                                                      previous example, or with index options to protect an entire portfolio.


                                           Long Stock, Short Call (Covered Call)
                                           Another way to protect a long stock position is with a covered call. As you will discover,
                                           it does not offer the complete protection of a long put. A covered call has limited risk
                                           protection. The protection is the premium received, so the breakeven is the stock price
                                           purchased minus the premium. A covered call writer has a neutral to slightly bullish
                                           sentiment. If the price of the underlying stock declines, the option will expire and the writer
                                           keeps the premium. As that price is declining, the long stock position is losing money. Once
                                           the decline exceeds the premium received, the maximum loss is all the way to zero. That is, if
                                           the stock was purchased at $50 per share and a 50 call was sold for 4 points, anything below
                                           $46 per share results in a loss. If the stock becomes worthless, the investor loses $46 per share.
                                           So, this is only a partial hedge.

                                           If the stock appreciates in above the strike price, the option will be exercised. This is not
                                           necessarily a bad thing, as the trade will generally be profitable. If the appreciation is less than
                                           the amount of the premium received, the profit will exceed what you would have made by
                                           buying the stock and selling it at the appreciated price. In our earlier example, if the stock
                                           rises to $53 per share, the call will be exercised and the writer will receive a total of 50 for the
                                           stock plus 4 for writing the call. That is $54 compared to selling the stock at $53.

                                                      EXAMPLE
                                                      An investor buys 100 shares of RST at 53 and writes 1 RST 55 call for 2. The maximum
                                                      gain equals $400. If the stock price rises above 55, the call will be exercised; thus, the
                                                      investor will sell the stock for a gain of $200, in addition to the $200 premium received.
                                                      The maximum loss is $5,100. Should the stock become worthless, the $200 premium
                                                      reduces the loss on the stock. The breakeven point is reached when the stock falls by
                                                      the amount of the premium received. Therefore, 53 – 2 = 51.
                                                      In this example, the customer is protected only on the downside by the amount of the
                                                      premium received for writing the call. Thus, the stock could fall to $51, at which point
                                                      the customer breaks even; the $2 loss on the stock is offset exactly by the premium
                                                      received. Below $51, losses begin. If the stock becomes worthless, the customer could
                                                      lose $5,100 (which is maximum loss). If the stock rises above $55, the option will be
                                                      exercised and the customer will be assigned and forced to sell stock at $55 for a $2
                                                      per share gain. Combined with the $2 per share premium received, the maximum
                                                      potential gain is $400.

                                  TAKE NOTE
                                  One of the drawbacks of writing calls against a long stock position is that it limits
                                  upside potential. Therefore, covered call writing is normally done in a stable market.
                                  The breakeven point for long stock-short call is cost of stock purchased minus
                                  premium.


                       Short Stock, Long Call
                       An investor sells short 100 shares of RST at 58 and buys an RST 60 call for 3. The investor’s
                       maximum gain is $5,500. If the stock becomes worthless, the investor gains $5,800 from the
                       short sale minus the $300 paid for the call. The maximum loss is $500. If the stock price rises
                       above $60, the investor will exercise the call to buy the stock for 60, incurring a $200 loss on
                       the short sale, in addition to the $300 paid for the call. The breakeven point is the stock’s sale
                       price minus the premium paid in this case, 58 – 3, or 55.

                       In a short stock sale, the potential loss is unlimited. One who sells stock short is obligated
                       to replace the borrowed stock, regardless of how high the price has risen. In this example,
                       no matter how high the stock rises, the investor can buy back the borrowed stock at 60 by
                       exercising the call. Therefore, the most the investor can lose on the short stock position is $2
                       per share. The cost of this protection is $3 per share. That makes the maximum potential loss
                       $5 per share, or $500. On the other hand, maximum gain will occur if the stock becomes
                       worthless. If the stock falls to zero, the customer will make $5,800 on the short stock position
                       less the $300 paid to buy the call. Overall, maximum potential gain is $5,500. The breakeven
                       point for short stock-long call is short sale price minus premium.


                       Short Stock, Short Put (Covered Put)
                       Just as writing a call can offer partial protection to a long stock position, writing a put can do
                       the same for an investor with a short stock position. This is one of the ways to cover a short
                       put. It is unlikely your exam will go deep into this strategy. Most often, you need to know
                       that a short put can be covered by a long put (the short put is no longer naked) and that this
                       strategy offers limited protection for a short stock seller. Just in case there is a surprise, here is
                       an example of the math involved.

                                  EXAMPLE
                                  An investor sells short 100 shares of ABC at $52 per share. At the same time, the
                                  investor sells 1 ABC DEC 50 put at 2. The investor’s breakeven point is the proceeds of
                                  the short stock sale plus the proceeds from the sale of the put. That is 52 + 2 = $54.
                                  Maximum gain is $400. Short stock sellers want the price of the stock to fall. As the
                                  stock falls below the $50 strike price, the option gets in the money and exercise is
                                  likely. Therefore, there is a dollar-for-dollar offset as the price falls. For each dollar
                                  made on the short stock sale, a dollar is lost on the short put option. The profit is
                                  capped at $400 for all prices below 50, (i.e., $200 on the stock positon plus the $200
                                  collected when selling the put).
                                  Maximum loss is unlimited. Even though there are two points of price protection
                                                                                                                                        Unit 10
                                  against an increase in the stock price, that doesn’t do much when the price of the
                                  stock has no upper limit.
                                  Losses could be unlimited if the stock price continues to increase, but they will always
                                  be $200 less than the stock trade alone. That still is considered unlimited on an exam
                                  question.

           LESSON 10.7: OPTIONS TAXATION
                                          LO 10.i Differentiate between the different kinds of tax treatment of options
                                          transactions.



                                          Introduction
                                          In most instances, the taxation of options transactions is similar to that of any other security.
                                          There are a few quirks and this lesson will explain those.


                                          Tax Rules for Options
                                          Because options are capital assets, capital gains tax rules apply. The tax consequences will vary
                                          depending on what the investor does with the option position.


                                          Expiration, Close, or Exercise
                                          There are three ways to handle an existing (open) option position. An open positon can
                                          expire, be closed in the open market, or be exercised by the party who is long (owner).


                                          Expiration
                                          At the expiration of an options contract, the buyer loses the premium; the seller profits from
                                          the premium. The buyer reports a capital loss equal to the premium amount; the seller reports
                                          a capital gain equal to the premium amount.

                                          The tax treatment for LEAPS writers at expiration is unique. Although investors may have
                                          held the contract for more than 12 months, LEAPS writers must report short-term capital
                                          gains at expiration. LEAPS buyers will report long-term losses and gains if the contract is held
                                          for more than 12 months. Essentially, LEAP contracts for buyers are handled like most other
                                          securities regarding long- and short-term gains and losses. For sellers, they are treated as any
                                          other short sale.


                                          Closing Out
                                          Closing sales or purchases generate a capital gain or loss equal to any price difference. This
                                          gain or loss must be reported on the basis of the date of the closing transaction. This is true
                                          for both buyers and sellers. For example, if an investor sells an option for a premium of 4 and
                                          then enters a closing purchase transaction at 6, there is a 2-point short-term capital loss. If
                                          the closing purchase was at 1, there would be a 3-point short-term capital gain. Likewise, an
                                          investor taking a long position in an option at 4 and entering a closing sale transaction at 6,
                                          there is a 2-point short-term capital gain (we’re excluding LEAPS—on the exam it will have
                                          to specify LEAPS; otherwise all options are 9 months maximum life). If the closing sale is at 1
                                          point, there is a 3-point short-term capital loss.

                                          As always, notice that whatever the writer makes is what the buyer loses, and the reverse.


                                          Exercise
                                          The exercise of options does not generate a capital gain or loss until a subsequent purchase or
                                          sale of the stock occurs. If a long call is exercised, the option holder buys the stock. Because

                       premium and strike price. The following chart identifies the tax consequences of these options
                       strategies. In the case of a long put, exercise will result in a taxable event. Stock is being sold
                       (put) at the strike price and that, minus the premium, must be compared to the purchase
                       price to determine the amount of gain or loss.

                       Stock Holding Periods
                       The IRS does not allow the use of options to postpone the sale of stock to generate long-term
                       capital gains treatment. Options that allow an investor to lock in a sale price are long puts.
                       If stock’s holding period is 12 months or less before the purchase of a put, the gain will be
                       classified as short-term.

                                  EXAMPLE
                                  An investor bought XYZ 11 months ago at 50. It now trades for 70. If the investor were
                                  to sell it now, the gain would be classified as short-term.
                                  Assume the investor buys a 70 put that will expire in three months. Even though the
                                  sale of the stock is postponed until up to 14 months have elapsed, the IRS still requires
                                  the holding period to be classified as short-term for tax purposes. Furthermore,
                                  purchasing the put eliminates the existing holding period. It does not begin aging all
                                  over again until the put expires. If the XYZ stock had been purchased more than 12
                                  months before the purchase of the put, its holding period would not be affected and
                                  any gains or losses would be long-term.


                       Married Put
                       If, on the same day, a customer buys stock and buys a put option on that stock as a hedge,
                       the put is said to be married to the stock. For tax purposes, irrespective of what happens to
                       the put, the cost basis of the stock is adjusted upward by the premium paid. Even if the put
                       expires worthless, there is no capital loss on the put. Rather, the premium paid is reflected in
                       the cost basis of the stock, which is the breakeven point for long stock/long put (cost of stock
                       purchased plus premium).
                                                                                                                                    Unit 10
                                  EXAMPLE
                                  If, on the same day, a customer buys 100 XYZ at 52 and buys 1 XYZ Jan 50 put at 2, the
                                  customer’s cost basis in the stock is 54.

                                                     Expect to see about five to seven questions on options taxation. Many of these
                                                     questions are a matter of finding the profit or loss, so use a T-chart. Remember that
                                                     option exercise alone does not create a taxable event.

                                                     PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                     22. On May 1, 2018, an investor purchased 100 shares of XYZ for $50 per share. On
                                                         November 10 of the same year, after XYZ’s price has rise to $54, the investor bought 1
                                                         XYZ Aug 55 put for 3. In August 2019, the put expires and in December of that year, the
                                                         investor sells the XYZ stock for $55 per share. Based on this information, it would be
                                                         correct to state that this investor realized
                                                           A. a long-term capital gain of $500.
                                                           B. a long-term capital gain of $200.
                                                           C. a short-term capital gain of $500.
                                                           D. a short-term capital gain of $200.
                                                         Answer: D. Because the investor bought the put on a stock with a short-term holding
                                                         period (less than 12 months), the holding period of the stock is erased and does not
                                                         start to age again until the put expires. That aging begins at day one in August, so
                                                         when the stock is sold in December, is it only four months old. That makes the sale
                                                         of the stock short term. We determine the gain or loss by comparing the cost to the
                                                         proceeds. The cost of the stock is $50 plus the premium of $3 ($53) and the proceeds
                                                         are $55. That is a gain of $200.


                                           Wash Sale Rule
                                           In Lesson 13.5, we will learn the details of the wash sale rule. One of the provisions of that
                                           rule deals with substantially identical securities. When applying that rule to call options,
                                           different options series are not substantially identical. That is, the ABC JAN 50 puts are a
                                           different security from the ABC MAR 50 puts. Keep this in mind when you get to that lesson.

                       New Account Form
                       When opening an options account, an options new account form or similar record must be
                       completed. In addition to standard new account information required of every customer, the
                       broker-dealer must seek to obtain the following information from customers who want to
                       trade options:
                        Investment objective(s) (e.g., safety of principal, income, or growth)
                        Employment status (name of employer, self-employed, or retired)
                        Estimated annual income from all sources
                        Estimated net worth (exclusive of residence)
                        Estimated liquid net worth (cash, securities, etc.)
                        Marital status and number of dependents
                        Legal age (whether the customer has reached the age of majority in that state)
                       In addition, the customer’s account record may contain the following information (if
                       applicable):
                        Investment experience and knowledge (e.g., number of years, size, frequency, and types of
                         transactions for options, stocks, bonds, other)
                        Source(s) of background and financial information for the customer
                        Date the ODD was furnished to the customer (not later than the date the account is
                         approved for options trading)
                        Nature and types of transactions for which the account is approved (e.g., buying,
                         uncovered writing, or spreading)
                        Whether this a retail (natural person) account or institutional account
                        Signature of the registered representative introducing the account
                        Signature of the registered options principal (ROP) or the general sales supervisor
                         approving the account and the date of approval


                       Written Approval by the ROP
                       Once the new account form is completed, a ROP or branch office manager must review and
                       approve the account in writing at or before the initial trade. The approver bases the approval
                       on review of the information pro­vided on the new account form. According to FINRA
                       Rule 2360, “based upon such information, the branch office manager, a Registered Options
                       Principal [Series 4] or a Limited Principal—General Securities Sales Supervisor [Series 10]
                       shall specifically approve or disapprove in writing the customer’s account for options trading.
                       ... If the branch office manager is not a Registered Options Principal or a Limited Principal—
                       General Securities Sales Supervisor, account approval or disapproval shall within ten (10)
                       business days be submitted to and approved or disapproved by a Registered Options Principal
                       or a Limited Principal—General Securities Sales Supervisor.” In the meantime, trading can

                                                      PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                      23. A customer first discusses options trading with a registered representative on July 3.
                                                          On July 7, the customer is approved for trading listed options, and on July 12, she
                                                          enters the first trade. The investor must receive an options disclosure document
                                                          (ODD) no later than
                                                           A. July 3.
                                                           B. July 7.
                                                           C. July 12.
                                                           D. July 13.
                                                          Answer: B. The ODD of the OCC must be given to the customer no later than at the
                                                          time the account is approved for options trading.


                                           Investment Strategies and Different Levels of Approval
                                           Many option strategies are specu­lative and designed to capitalize on movements in the price
                                           of the underlying asset. Inves­tors also use options to enhance returns or limit risks. Investment
                                           strategies that involve multiple option positions include spreads, straddles, and combinations,
                                           and all are strategies in which an investor buys or sells more than one option at a time.
                                           A basic level of option trading is buying options. Additional approval may be required if the
                                           customer wishes to engage in option writing (including writing covered calls), uncovered
                                           option writing, ratio writing, spreads and straddles, and other strategies.

                                           Using the customer information gathered to facilitate opening the account, the ROP will
                                           determine which of the different levels of options trading might be appropriate and meet
                                           suitability standards; the account will be approved accordingly. While levels of approval may
                                           differ from member firm to member firm, they are generally similar in that there may be four
                                           or five levels, with each level to include the strategies of the previous level, and similar in the
                                           specific strategies allowed for each level as well. A typical example might be as follows:
                                            Level I—Covered options (calls and puts)
                                            Level II—Long calls, puts, straddles, and combinations
                                            Level III—Spreads (calls and puts)
                                            Level IV – Uncovered (naked calls and puts), short straddles, combinations, and ratio
                                             spreads

                                           For customers approved to write uncovered calls or puts, the firm must have written
                                           procedures in place covering
                                            specific criteria used in approving such accounts,
                                            specific minimum equity requirements for such accounts, and
                                            the requirement to provide the customer with a special written document describing the
                                             risks involved in uncovered writing (Special Statement for Uncovered Options Writers).
                                             This document must be provided to the customer before the initial uncovered sale.


                                           Verification by the Customer
                                           Within 15 days of account approval, the firm must obtain from the customer a signed written
                                           agreement (customer option agreement) that the account will be handled under the rules of
                                           the OCC and the CBOE and that the customer will not violate position or exercise limits.
                                           The signature also verifies the accuracy of the information provided on the new account form.

                                           Options Contract Adjustments

                                                                                                                                                       Unit 10
                                           The rules require adjusting options contracts for stock splits, reverse stock splits, stock
                                           dividends, and rights offerings. Adjustments are not made for ordinary cash dividends.
                                           Adjustments to the number of shares are rounded down to the next whole share. First, we will
                                           look at the concept and examine some examples. An investor bullish on ABC stock buys 1
                                           ABC 50 call. The contract is good for 100 shares at $50 per share and, if the stock rises, the
                                           investor stands to make a profit. What happens if ABC has a 2:1 split? We know there will
                                           now be twice as many shares at half the price. How does that impact our call buyer? Surely

                                           buying 100 of the new shares at 50 isn’t fair. Recognizing this, the rules provide that this
                                           investor’s position will change to reflect the split. Instead of 1 contract for 100 shares at 50,
                                           there will now be 2 contracts for 100 shares at 25.

                                           When even stock splits occur, additional options contracts are created. An even split ends in
                                           1—such as a 2:1, 3:1, or 4:1 split.

                                                      EXAMPLE
                                                      After a 2:1 split, 1 ALF 60 call becomes 2 ALF 30 calls. A 2:1 creates 200 shares instead of
                                                      100, so the owner has twice as many contracts as before, at half the exercise price.
                                                      The total exercise value remains the same:
                                                          Original contract: 100 × 60 = $6,000
                                                          New contracts: 200 × 30 = $6,000
                                           An uneven split, also known as a fractional split, such as a 3:2 or 5:4, does not create
                                           additional options contracts. Contracts adjusted for uneven splits include a larger number of
                                           shares and will receive a new option contract symbol.

                                                      EXAMPLE
                                                      After a 3:2 split, 1 FLA 60 call will effectively be represented by 1 FLA 40 call with 150
                                                      shares in the contract.
                                                      The total exercise value effectively remains the same as before:
                                                          Original contract: 100 × 60 = $6,000
                                                          New contract when closed or exercised: 150 × 40 = $6,000

                                                      EXAMPLE
                                                      Note that stock dividends are treated as uneven splits; the number of contracts
                                                      remains the same, strike price is adjusted, and the contract now covers more shares.
                                                      After a 20% stock dividend, 1 LFA 60 call will be represented by 1 LFA 50 call with 120
                                                      shares in the contract. How did we do the math? A 20% stock dividend is an additional
                                                      20 shares. Dividing the original exercise value of $6,000 by the new number of shares
                                                      (120) results in a strike price of $50 per share.
                                                          Original contract: 100 × 60 = $6,000
                                                          New contract when closed or exercised: 120 × 50 = $6,000
                                                      It is important to note that whatever the adjustment, monetary value remains the
                                                      same.


                                           The Functioning of the Listed Options Market
                                           Options trade on several U.S. exchanges and OTC. Exchange-traded options are listed
                                           options and have standardized exercise prices and expiration dates. OTC options are called
                                           conventional options and are not standardized. As a result, little secondary market activity
                                           exists because contract terms are individually negotiated between the buyer and seller; no
                                           two contracts are the same. As stated earlier, we don't expect anything on OTC options on
                                           the exam.

                       The key to the listed options market is the standardization. That allows for active secondary
                       trading.


                       Trading Times
                       Listed stock options trade from 9:30 am to 4:00 pm ET (3:00 pm CT). Note that broad-
                       based index options trade until 4:15 pm ET (3:15 pm CT).


                       Exercise
                       The latest time for turning in an exercise notice is 5:30 pm ET (4:30 pm CT).


                       Expiration
                       Listed stock options expire on the third Friday of the month at 11:59 pm ET. The final time
                       for trading an option is 4:00 pm ET on the final day of trading (expiration). Why is there a
                       difference between the exercise deadline and the middle of the night expiration? The hours
                       between 5:30 pm (the latest an option can be exercised) and 11:59 pm on the third Friday of
                       the expiry month allow firms time to clear their books of option transactions by notifying the
                       OCC.


                       Settlement
                       Listed options transactions settle on the next business day. Stock delivered as a result of
                       exercise is settled on a regular way basis (two business days).


                       Automatic Exercise
                       Contracts that are in the money by at least 0.01 at expiration are automatically exercised
                       as a service to the customer unless other instructions have been given. Automatic exercise
                       applies to both retail customer and institutional accounts. Customers may give do not
                       exercise instructions for any contract in the money if they do not want to have their contract                  Unit 10
                       exercised. All instructions must be received by the OCC no later than 5:30 pm ET on the
                       third Friday of the expiration month (last day of trading).

                                           Position Limits
                                           For the most heavily traded equity options contracts, position limits are 250,000 contracts on
                                           the same side of the market. This limit is subject to frequent adjustment.

                                           Position limits apply to individuals, registered representatives acting for discretionary
                                           accounts, and individuals acting in concert (acting together as one person). A group of
                                           investors cannot avoid the position restrictions by intentionally splitting a large posi­tion
                                           to circumvent the limits. The aggregate position of individuals acting in concert applies in
                                           determining whether there is a breach of position limits. LEAPS are added to traditional
                                           options to determine whether a violation of the position limit rules has occurred.

                                                      EXAMPLE
                                                      WRJ Corporation is in the lowest tier and subject to a position limit of 25,000 contracts.
                                                      If two individuals, acting in concert, each were long 13,000 WRJ calls, both would be in
                                                      violation of exchange rules.
                                           In determining whether individuals are acting in concert, the CBOE looks for control, which
                                           indicates the ability to make investment decisions for an account or influence the invest­ment
                                           decisions made for an account. Control is presumed when
                                            all parties to a joint account have authority to act on behalf of the account and
                                            a person has the authority to execute transactions in an account.




Series_7_2E.indb 306                                                                                                                          11/19/2021 7:53:17 PM
                                                                                                 Unit 10   Options      307


                       Therefore, the following accounts will be presumed to be acting in concert unless evi­dence to
                       the contrary is given to and accepted by an exchange:
                        An individual account (for example, for one spouse) or a joint account (for exam­ple, for a
                         married couple)—a spouse clearly exercises control over his account and has the authority
                         to act in a joint account. In this case, positions in both accounts would be aggregated to
                         determine whether a violation of position limits exists.
                        An individual who has discretion over an account and the account itself—the option posi­
                         tion in the account of the person holding third-party trading authority is aggregated with
                         positions in the account over which this individual has discretion to determine whether a
                         position violation exists.

                       Position limits are measured by the number of contracts on the same side of the market. There
                       are two sides: the bull side and the bear side. Long calls and short puts represent the former;
                       long puts and short calls represent the latter.

                       Take for example a company subject to a 250,000-contract limit. If a customer were long
                       140,000 calls and 140,000 puts, there would be no violation. However, if the same customer
                       were long 140,000 calls and short 140,000 puts, the customer would have 280,000 contracts
                       on the bull side of the market—a violation. In determining whether a violation has occurred,
                       long calls are aggregated with short puts and long puts are aggregated with short calls.


                       Exercise Limits
                       OCC exercise limits are the maximum number of contracts that can be exercised on the
                       same side of the market within a specified period. Currently, the period is five consecutive
                       business days. For the most heavily traded equity options contracts, no more than 250,000
                       contracts on the same side of the market may be exercised within a five-business-day period.
                       As with position limits, the maximum number applicable to exercise limits can vary from one
                       underlying security to another, and to determine if a violation has occurred, long calls and
                       short puts (bullish contracts) are aggregated, and short calls and long puts (bearish contract)
                       are aggregated.

                       Like position limits, exercise limits apply to individuals, individuals acting in concert, and
                       registered representatives acting for discretionary accounts, among others.


                       American- or European-Style Contracts
                       Investors with a long position can exercise their contract anytime before expiration if the
                       contract is an American-style option. European-style options can be exercised on expiration
                       day (last day of trading) only. Nearly all equity options are American style. FCOs may be
                       either American style or European style, and most index options are European-style contracts,
                       including weekly index contracts. Yield-based options are European-style contracts.

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 A tool for remembering the difference between American and European exercise is to

                                                                                                                                 Unit 10
                                 look at the first letter.
                                 A for American means anytime.
                                 E for European means expiration date.

              INTRODUCTION
                         The most common example of a packaged product is the mutual fund. There are many others,
                         and those are the subject of this unit. A packaged product is an investment that relieves the
                         investor of daily decision making. In the case of real estate investment trusts (REITS), investors
                         do not have to find the properties or manage them. That is taken care of for them by the
                         management of the trust. The same is true with a direct participation program (DPP). The
                         program handles the details, not the investors.

           LESSON 11.1: REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (REITS)
                                        LO 11.a Identify the types and characteristics of real estate investment trusts.



                                        Types of REITS
                                        A real estate investment trust (REIT) (pronounced reet) is a company that manages
                                        a portfolio of real estate investments to earn profits and/or income for its shareholders.
                                        Like many other pooled investment vehicles, REITs offer professional management and
                                        diversification. REITs are normally publicly traded and serve as a source of long-term
                                        financing for real estate projects. A REIT pools capital in a manner similar to an investment
                                        company. There are three basic types of REITs:
                                         Equity REITs. Own commercial property.
                                          – They take an ownership position in the properties. They receive rental income and
                                             possible capital gains upon a future sale of the properties.
                                         Mortgage REITs. Own mortgages on commercial property.
                                          – They make real estate loans (mortgages). Their earnings come from the interest
                                             payments on those loans.
                                         Hybrid REITs. Own commercial property and own mortgages on commercial property.
                                          – They are, as the name implies, a combination of both mortgage and equity REITs.

                                        REITs are organized as trusts in which investors buy and sell shares either on stock exchanges
                                        or in the OTC market. They are not redeemable as is the case with mutual funds or UITs, but
                                        have the liquidity of listed stocks. REITs do compute a NAV per unit. As you can imagine,
                                        the valuation of real estate is not as exact as the price of publicly traded stock. Therefore, the
                                        NAV is only an approximation. Because REITs are not redeemed by the issuer, the prices are
                                        based on supply and demand. Just as with CEFs, the price an investor pays can be more, less,
                                        or the same as the NAV.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    In recent years, there has been substantial growth in the number of nontraded REITs
                                                    (limited liquidity). However, for exam purposes, assume the REIT is publicly traded
                                                    unless the question states otherwise.
                                        What are the benefits of including REITs in a client’s portfolio?
                                         REITs allow investors the opportunity to invest in real estate without incurring the degree
                                          of liquidity risk historically associated with real estate because REITs trade on exchanges
                                          and OTC.
                                         Properties are selected by professionals with greater negotiating power than an individual.
                                         There is a negative correlation to the general stock market because real estate prices and
                                          the stock market frequently move in opposite directions.
                                         There is reasonable income and/or potential capital appreciation.
                                        In doing so, the client would be incurring the following risks:
                                         The investor has no direct control over the portfolio and relies on professional
                                          management to make all purchase and sale decisions. While the expectation of having a
                                          professionally managed portfolio should be considered advantageous, the quality of the
                                          portfolio lies with the quality of the professional management.

                        REITs generally have greater price volatility than direct ownership of real estate because
                         they are influenced by stock market conditions.
                        If the REIT is not publicly traded, liquidity is very limited. As a result, there is the need
                         for more stringent suitability standards and the regulators give greater scrutiny to trades in

                       participation programs (DPPs). The exam will require you to know that REITs are not DPPs.
                       We will discuss the difference in the DPP section.

                       LO 11.b Recall the tax treatment of REITs.



                       REIT Taxation
                       REITs enjoy a unique hybrid status for federal income tax purposes. A REIT shareholder
                       generally is taxed only on dividends paid by the REIT and on gains upon the disposition
                       of REIT shares. A REIT is a corporation for U.S. tax purposes. The REIT is generally not
                       subject to corporate tax if it distributes to its shareholders substantially all of its taxable
                       income for each year

                       How much is substantially all? Under the guidelines of Subchapter M of the IRC, a REIT can
                       avoid being taxed as a corporation by receiving 75% or more of its income from real estate
                       and distributing 90% or more of its taxable income to its shareholders.

                       Shareholders receive dividends from investment income. In most cases, those dividends are
                       taxed at ordinary income rates rather than as qualified dividends. If there are capital gains
                       distributions, they are generally taxed at the favorable long-term capital gains rate. Please note
                       that with the advent of the Tax Cut and JOBS Act of 2017 (TCJA), there are some complex
                       tax issues with REITs and those are not likely to be tested.
                       A tax-related concern for investors is that failure to meet the distribution rules could cause the
                       REIT to be taxed. That would lead to another level of taxation before the income gets to the
                       investor.

                                  TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                  Important points to remember about REITs:
                                     An owner of REITs holds an undivided interest in a pool of real estate investments.
                                     REITs are liquid because they trade on exchanges and OTC.
                                     REITs are not investment companies (mutual funds).
                                     REITs offer dividends and gains to investors but do not offer flow-through losses
                                      like limited partnerships, and therefore are not considered direct participation
                                      programs.
                                     REITs are not DPPs (losses do not flow through).
                                     A REIT must receive 75% or more of its income from real estate, have at least
                                      75% of its assets in real estate and cash, and distribute 90% or more of its taxable
                                      income to its shareholders to avoid taxation as a corporation.
                                     Dividends from REITs are not qualified; they are taxed as ordinary income.

                                                           Answer: B. To qualify under IRS regulations, REITs must distribute at least 90% of
                                                           their taxable income in the form of dividends to shareholders. At least 75% of the
                                                           REIT’s income must come from real estate investments.


           LESSON 11.2: DPPS AND THEIR INVESTORS

                                        LO 11.c Recognize the structure of a DPP.

                                        Direct participation programs (DPPs) are investments that pass income, gains, losses, and
                                        tax benefits (such as depreciation, depletion, and tax credits) directly to the limited partners.
                                        There are some unique tax concepts and suitability issues associated with DPPs. Limited
                                        partnerships are one of the most common types of DPPs. They can also be set up as an S
                                        corporation or limited liability companies (LLCs).

                                        Because the exam focuses on the limited partnership, so will we.


                                        Structuring a Limited Partnership
                                        The concept of a partnership for our purposes is based upon tax law. An unincorporated
                                        organization with two or more members is generally classified as a partnership for federal tax
                                        purposes if its members engage in a trade, business, financial operation, or venture and divide
                                        its profits. However, a joint undertaking merely to share expenses is not a partnership. For
                                        example, co-ownership of property maintained and rented or leased is not a partnership unless
                                        the co-owners provide services to the tenants.
                                        In the case of a limited partnership, one of those members is the limited partner (LP) and the
                                        other the general partner (GP). We will get into the details of their roles later in this lesson.

                                        An organization is classified as a partnership for federal tax purposes if it has two or more
                                        members and is none of the following:
                                         An organization that refers to itself as incorporated or as a corporation
                                         An insurance company
                                         A REIT
                                         An organization classified as a trust or otherwise subject to special treatment under the
                                          IRC

                                        To qualify as a partnership, the business entity must avoid corporate characteristics such
                                        as continuity of life. This is the easiest of the corporate characteristics to avoid because
                                        partnerships have a predetermined date of dissolution when they are established, whereas
                                        corporations are expected to exist in perpetuity.

                                 Exam questions may test avoidance of corporate characteristics. For example:
                                 1. Which of these characteristics is the most difficult to avoid?


                                                                                                                                      Unit 11
                                 Centralized management—no business can function without it.
                                 2. Which of these characteristics is the easiest to avoid?
                                 Continuity of life—there is a predetermined time at which the partnership interest must
                                  be dissolved.
                                 3. Which two corporate characteristics are most likely to be avoided by a DPP?
                                 Continuity of life and freely transferable interests—interests cannot be freely
                                  transferred; GP approval must transfer shares.


                       Issuing Limited Partnership Interests
                       Limited partnerships may be sold through private placements or public offerings. If sold
                       privately, investors receive a private placement memorandum for disclosure. Generally, such
                       private placements involve a small group of investors, each contributing a large sum of money.
                       These investors must be accredited investors—that is, they must meet certain net worth or
                       income standards. The general public does not meet this description.

                       In a public offering, partnerships are sold with a prospectus to a larger number of investors,
                       each making a relatively small capital contribution, such as $1,000–$5,000.

                       The syndicator oversees the selling and promotion of the partnership. The syndicator
                       is responsible for the preparation of any paperwork necessary for the registration of the
                       partnership. Syndication or finders fees are limited to 10% of the gross dollar amount of
                       securities sold.


                       Required Documentation
                       Three important documents are required for limited partnerships to exist:
                        The certificate of limited partnership
                        The partnership agreement
                        The subscription agreement


                       Certificate of Limited Partnership
                       For legal recognition, the certificate of limited partnership must be filed in the home state of
                       the partnership. It includes
                        the partnership’s name;
                        the partnership’s business;
                        the principal place of business;
                        the amount of time the partnership expects to be in business;
                        the conditions under which the partnership will be dissolved;
                        the size of each LP’s current and future expected investments;
                        the contribution return date, if set;
                        the share of profits or other compensation to each LP;

                                         the conditions for LP’s assignment of ownership interests;
                                         whether the limited partnership may admit other LPs; and
                                         whether the business can be continued by remaining GPs at death or incapacity of a GP.


                                        Partnership Agreement
                                        Each partner receives a copy of this agreement. It describes the roles of the GPs and LPs and
                                        guidelines for the partnership’s operation.


                                        Subscription Agreement
                                        All investors interested in becoming LPs (passive investors) must complete a subscription
                                        agreement. The agreement appoints one or more GPs to act on behalf of the investors and
                                        is only effective when the GPs sign it. Along with the subscriber’s money, the subscription
                                        agreement must include
                                         the investor’s net worth,
                                         the investor’s annual income,
                                         a statement attesting that the investor understands the risk involved, and
                                         a power of attorney appointing the GP as the agent of the partnership.
                                        In addition to a cash contribution, subscribers may assume responsibility for the repayment
                                        of a portion of a loan made to the partnership. This type of loan is called a recourse loan.
                                        Frequently, partnerships also borrow money through nonrecourse loans; the GPs have
                                        responsibility for repayment of nonrecourse loans (not the LPs).

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    LPs are liable for a proportionate share of recourse loans assumed by partnerships.
                                                    LPs have no liability for nonrecourse loans and only in real estate DPPs does the
                                                    nonrecourse loan add to the investor’s basis.

                                         Dissolving a Limited Partnership
                                         Generally, limited partnerships are liquidated on the date specified in the partnership
                                         agreement. Early shutdown may occur if the partnership sells or disposes of its assets or if a
                                         decision is made to dissolve the partnership by the LPs holding a majority interest. When

                                                      other hand, the GPs bear the liability for the debts of the entity.


              LESSON 11.3: TYPES OF DPPS

                                      LO 11.e Name the different types of DPPs and how they are offered.



                                      Introduction
                                      As with so many of the investment products we’ve discussed, DPPs come in many different
                                      “flavors.” It is important to recognize that DPPs are one way to structure a business. We
                                      commonly see huge corporations and single person sole proprietorships. As we go through
                                      the different types of DPPs, remember, these are just businesses using the limited partnership
                                      structure as a way to raise capital.


                                      Real Estate Partnerships
                                      Real estate DPPs are by far the most popular type. There are five different kinds and, as you
                                      will see in the following tables, some offer income, some offer potential growth, and some
                                      offer both.

                                               PRACTICE QUESTION
                                               4.   All of the following would generally be associated with an existing real estate DPP
                                                    except
                                                     A. immediate income stream.
                                                     B. high appreciation potential.
                                                     C. known history of income and expenses.
                                                     D. lower risk than other types of real estate programs.
                                                    Answer: B. High appreciation potential is generally not associated with existing real
                                                    estate programs. Investors looking for larger gains prefer new construction. The other
                                                    choices are clear benefits. Buying an existing office building or apartment has very
                                                    few surprises.


                                    Oil and Gas Partnerships
                                    Oil and gas programs include speculative drilling programs and income programs that invest
                                    in producing wells. We will list them from the most risk to the least risk.

                                    Three types of oil and gas programs are exploratory, developmental, and income. Some
                                    offerings combine two or all three into a combination program.


                                    Exploratory (Wildcatting)
               Partnership Objective   Locate undiscovered reserves of oil and/or gas
               Advantages              High rewards for discovery of new reserves
               Disadvantages           Few new wells produce
               Tax Features            High intangible drilling costs for immediate tax sheltering
               Degree of Risk          High; most risky oil and gas program


                                    Developmental
               Partnership Objective   Drill near existing fields to discover new reserves (called step-out wells)
               Advantages              Less discovery risk than exploratory
               Disadvantages           Few new wells produce
               Tax Features            Medium intangible drilling costs, immediate tax sheltering
               Degree of Risk          Medium to high risk

                                        Income
            Partnership Objective          Provide immediate income from sale of existing oil
            Advantages                     Immediate cash flow
            Disadvantages                  Oil prices; well stops producing
            Tax Features                   Income sheltering from depletion allowances
            Degree of Risk                 Low


                                        Equipment Leasing Programs
                                        Equipment leasing programs are created when DPPs purchase equipment leased to other
                                        businesses. Investors receive income from lease payments and also a proportional share of
                                        write-offs from operating expenses, interest expenses, and depreciation. Tax credits were once
                                        available through these programs but were discontinued by tax law changes. The primary
                                        investment objective of these programs is tax-sheltered income.


                                        Issuing Partnership Investments
                                        DPPs may be offered either as private placements, qualifying for an exemption from
                                        registration under state and federal law, or publicly registered either with the SEC, the state(s),
                                        or both. Most are sold in private placements. When sold privately, they are usually limited to
                                        accredited investors.

                                        Unlike most securities, sales are conditioned upon acceptance of subscribers. That means that
                                        just because the investor wants to buy, he may not be accepted by the GP. Many offerings use
                                        wholesalers. These are individuals or firms paid to serve as an interface between the issuer and
                                        broker-dealers and their sales force. It is legal for them to be compensated for their services.
                                        That compensation is usually on the basis of sales of program interests.

                                        One of the most important requirements is performing due diligence. FINRA defines that
                                        as “the exercise of reasonable care to determine that the offering disclosures are accurate and
                                        complete.” This helps the broker-dealer avoid fraud charges. Investigating the background of
                                        the management is one action taken in performing due diligence. For those who have a track
                                        record, checking it is an important step. Finally, the broker-dealer will evaluate all fees and
                                        other distribution of the offering’s proceeds. At the end of this unit, we’ll go a bit deeper into
                                        some of FINRA’s rules on offering compensation.


           LESSON 11.4: DPP TAXATION
                                        LO 11.f Identify the tax ramifications of investing in DPPs.



                                        Introduction
                                        It is important to understand that a DPP is just a different way to invest in a business rather
                                        than buying the company’s stock. There are certain tax advantages to being structured as a
                                        partnership with the flow-through of income or loss being one of them. That aside, this is
                                        merely an investment in a business, whether it be a Real Estate Limited Partnership, an oil

                       and gas drilling program, or a movie production company. Important tax concepts associated
                       with DPPs include the following:
                        DPPs were formerly known as tax shelters because investors used losses to reduce or
                         shelter ordinary income (by writing off passive losses against ordinary income).
                        Tax law revisions now classify income and loss from these investments as passive income                      Unit 11
                         and loss. Current law allows passive losses to shelter only passive income, not all ordinary
                         income as before. Many programs lost their appeal because of this critical change in tax
                         law.
                        As we learned in Unit 1, passive income is not considered earned income for the purpose
                         of making an IRA contribution.
                        The IRS considers programs without any economic viability to be abusive tax shelters.
                         The promoters and investors can face severe penalties.

                       The key tax benefit of DPPs is that they allow the economic consequences of a business to
                       flow-through to investors. Any income or loss to the investor is considered passive because the
                       investor does not take an active role in the management of the business—that is the role of
                       the GP. Unlike corporations, limited partnerships pay no dividends. Rather, they pass income,
                       gains, losses, deductions, and credits directly to investors. While each of the DPPs covered
                       offer flow-through, some of the details are unique to each program. Let’s look at them one at a
                       time.


                       Real Estate Program Taxation
                       As we know, the tax benefit from all DPPs is that operating losses flow-through to investors.
                       When a corporation loses money, there is no tax benefit to the shareholders. When a DPP
                       shows a loss, that loss can be used to offset passive income and save on taxes. The exam wants
                       you to know the specific source of those tax losses for each of the programs.

                       In the case of a real estate program, expenses creating the losses are
                        mortgage interest expense,
                        depreciation allowances for the “wearing out of the building,” and
                        expenses for improvement to the property.
                       In addition, there are two other benefits unique to real estate programs:
                        Nonrecourse debt adds to the investor’s cost basis. We will get to this shortly.
                        Tax credits are offered for government-assisted housing and historic rehabilitation
                         projects. The advantage of a tax credit is that is reduces tax liability dollar-for-dollar.

                                  EXAMPLE
                                  An individual in the 30% tax bracket receives a tax deduction of $1,000. By lowering
                                  her income by $1,000, she saves $300 in tax. But, if she received a $1,000 tax credit, she
                                  lowers her taxes by $1,000.

                                        Oil and Gas Program Taxation
                                        Unique tax advantages associated with oil and gas programs include intangible drilling costs
                                        (IDCs) and depletion allowances.


                                        Intangible Drilling Costs
                                        Write-offs for the expenses of drilling are usually 100% deductible in the first year of
                                        operation. These include costs associated with drilling such as wages, supplies, fuel costs,
                                        and insurance. Intangible drilling costs (IDCs) can be defined as any cost that, after being
                                        incurred, has no salvage value.


                                        Tangible Drilling Costs
                                        Tangible drilling costs are those costs incurred that have salvage value (e.g., storage tanks and
                                        wellhead equipment). These costs are not immediately deductible; rather, they are deducted
                                        (depreciated) over several years.


                                        Depletion Allowances
                                        The IRS allows allowances in the form of tax deductions that compensate the partnership
                                        for the decreasing supply of oil or gas (or any other resource or mineral). Depletion is only
                                        allowed for natural resource programs. That includes timber and mining DPPs.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    Depletion allowances may be taken only once the oil or gas is sold. There are two
                                                    forms of depletion, cost and percentage. Other than knowing these two terms, we do
                                                    not expect any detail on these to be on the exam.


                                        Oil and Gas Sharing Arrangements
                                        The costs and revenues associated with oil and gas programs are shared in a variety of ways. A
                                        description of these arrangements follows:
                                         Overriding royalty interest. The holder of this interest receives royalties but has no
                                          partnership risk. An example of this arrangement is a landowner who sells mineral rights
                                          to a partnership.
                                         Reversionary working interest. The GP bears no costs of the program and receives no
                                          revenue until LPs have recovered their capital. LPs bear all deductible and nondeductible
                                          costs.
                                         Net operating profits interest. The GP bears none of the program’s costs but is entitled
                                          to a percentage of net profits. The LPs bear all deductible and nondeductible costs. This
                                          arrangement is available only in private placements.
                                         Disproportionate sharing. The GP bears a relatively small percentage of expenses but
                                          receives a relatively large percentage of the revenues.
                                         Carried interest. The GP shares tangible drilling costs with the LPs but receives no
                                          IDCs. LPs receive the immediate deductions, whereas the GP receives write-offs from
                                          depreciation over the life of the property.
                                         Functional allocation. This is the most common sharing arrangement. The limited
                                          partnerships receive the IDCs, which allow immediate deductions. The GP receives the
                                          tangible drilling costs, which are depreciated over several years. Revenues are shared.

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 5.   Which of the following sharing arrangements is the most common in an oil and gas
                                      DPP?
                                       A. Net operating profits interest

                                                                                                                                    Unit 11
                                       B. Carried interest
                                       C. Functional allocation
                                       D. Overriding royalty interest
                                      Answer: C. Functional allocation is most commonly used because it gives the best
                                      benefits to both parties. The LPs receive the immediate tax write-offs from the IDCs,
                                      whereas the GPs receive continued write-offs from the tangible costs over the course
                                      of several years. Both share equally in the revenues.


                       Tax Features Applicable to All DPPs
                       As described, a partnership distributes income, losses, and gains to the LPs because of their
                       flow-through nature. Limited partnerships, as with other businesses, are able to apply certain
                       deductions and tax credits to income as described here.


                       Business Deductions
                       Expenses of the partnership, such as salaries, interest payments, and management fees,
                       result in deductions in the current year to the income of the business. Principal payments
                       on property are not deductible expenses. Compare that to a home mortgage. The interest is
                       deductible, but that portion of the mortgage payments applied to reduce the loan is not.

                       Cost recovery systems offer write-offs over a period of years as defined by IRS schedules.
                       Depreciation write-offs apply to cost recovery of expenditures for equipment and real
                       estate (land cannot be depreciated). Depletion allowances apply to the using up of natural
                       resources, such as oil and gas. Depreciation and depletion allowances may be claimed only
                       when income is being produced by the partnership. Also, recognize that some assets are not
                       depreciable, nor can they be depleted. For example, farm crops fall into this category and are
                       generally known to be renewable assets.

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 Depreciation may be taken on a straight-line (i.e., the same amount each year) or
                                 accelerated basis. Accelerated depreciation, known as a modified accelerated cost
                                 recovery system, increases deductions during the early years and decreases them
                                 during the later years.

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 The crossover point is the point at which the program begins to generate taxable
                                 income instead of losses. This generally occurs in later years when income increases
                                 and deductions decrease.


                       Tax Basis
                       An investor’s tax basis represents the upper limit on deductibility of losses. LPs must keep
                       track of their tax basis, or amount at risk, to determine their gain or loss upon the sale
                       of their partnership interest. An investor’s basis is subject to adjustment periodically for
                       occurrences such as cash distributions and additional investments.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    A LPs basis consists of
                                                          cash contributions to the partnership,
                                                          noncash property contributions to the partnership,
                                                          recourse debt of the partnership, and
                                                          nonrecourse debt for real estate partnerships only.
                                                    Partners must adjust their basis at year-end. Any distributions of cash or property
                                                    and repayments of recourse debt (also nonrecourse debt for real estate only) are
                                                    reductions to a partner’s basis. Partners are allowed deductions up to the amount of
                                                    their adjusted cost basis.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    With nonrecourse debt, other than any collateral pledged, the lender has no other
                                                    option to pursue the borrower. With recourse debt, if the pledged collateral is not
                                                    sufficient to satisfy the obligation, the lender can file a suit to recover the balance.
                                                    As a lender, you would prefer recourse debt. As a borrower, you would prefer a
                                                    nonrecourse loan.

                                                    EXAMPLE
                                                    If a partner’s basis is $25,000 at year-end and the investor has losses of $35,000, only
                                                    $25,000 of the losses may be used to deduct against passive income. The remaining
                                                    $10,000 may be carried forward.


                                        Computing Tax Basis
                                        Tax basis is computed using the following formula:

                                              investment in partnership + share of recourse debt (+ nonrecourse debt in real estate
                                              DPPs) – cash or distributions = basis
                                        It is important to note that any up-front costs incurred by the investor will not affect
                                        beginning basis. Assume that an LP invests $50,000 in a partnership unit, and the broker-
                                        dealer selling the unit takes a commission of $3,000. Therefore, only $47,000 of the
                                        investment goes into the partnership. However, the investor’s beginning basis is $50,000, not
                                        $47,000.

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                    6.     A customer invests $10,000 in a DPP and signs a recourse note for $40,000. During the
                                                           first year, the investor receives a cash distribution from the partnership for $5,000. At
                                                           year-end, she receives a statement showing that her share of partnership losses is
                                                           $60,000. How much of that $60,000 can she deduct on her tax return?

                                    TAKE NOTE
                                    If a partnership interest is sold, the gain or loss is the difference between sales
                                    proceeds and adjusted basis at the time of sale. If, at the time of sale, the customer
                                    has unused losses, these losses may be added to the cost basis. If a customer has an

                                                                                                                                      Unit 11
                                    adjusted cost basis of $22,000 and unused losses of $10,000 and sells her partnership
                                    interest for $20,000, her loss on the sale would be $12,000.


                         Tax Filing Requirements
                         Limited partnerships do not file a formal tax return because everything flows through to
                         the investors. An information return is filed on Form 1065, with a Schedule K-1 sent to the
                         partners indicating the amount of income or loss attributable to each of them. Remember, the
                         business entity pays no income tax—all reportable income/loss flows through to the partners.
                         Form 1065 is due on March 15 of the following year. The year-end for these businesses is
                         typically December 31. Taxes are due on April 15, when the individual partners file their
                         Form 1040s showing their share of the business’s income or loss that was reported on the
                         Schedule K-1.


              LESSON 11.5 EVALUATING THE DPP
                         LO 11.g Recognize the importance of proper evaluation of DPPs.



                         Introduction
                         In selecting a limited partnership interest to participate in, an investor should first consider
                         whether the partnership matches his investment objectives and has economic viability.
                         Economic viability means that there is potential for returns from cash distributions
                         and capital gains. Although tax benefits may be attractive, they should not be the first
                         consideration in the purchase of an interest in a DPP.


                         Measuring Economic Soundness
                         There is an old saying in the real estate business. When valuing a property, what are the
                         three most important factors? The answer is location, location, location. When it comes to
                         evaluating a DPP, there are also three factors: economic soundness, economic soundness, and
                         economic soundness. How is the economic soundness or viability measured? Two methods
                         applied to the analysis of DPPs are cash flow analysis and internal rate of return.
                          Cash flow analysis compares income (revenues) to expenses.
                          Internal rate of return determines the present value of estimated future revenues and sales
                           proceeds to allow comparison to other programs.


                         Cash Flow
                         Cash flow is defined as net income or loss plus noncash changes (such as depreciation).

                                                    EXAMPLE
                                                     Revenue:              $300,000

                                                    This example shows a loss of $30,000. However, when we add back in depreciation,
                                                    the cash flow is a positive $20,000.

                                        Internal Rate of Return
                                        The internal rate of return (IRR) is the discount rate (r) that makes the future value of an
                                        investment equal to its present value.

                                        You will not have to do any calculations with IRR. All you need to know is that it takes into
                                        consideration the time value of money and is a favorite method of evaluating a DPP.


                                        Other Evaluation Factors
                                        Here are additional factors that investors should consider in their overall analysis of these
                                        investments:
                                         Management ability and experience of the GP in running other similar programs
                                         Blind pool or nonspecific program—in a blind pool, less than 75% of the assets are
                                          specified as to use; however, in a specified program, at least 75% have been identified
                                         Time frame of the partnership
                                         Similarity of start-up costs and revenue projections to those of comparable ventures
                                         Lack of liquidity of the interest
                                        Partnership interests are not for all investors. Careful consideration must be given to the
                                        overall safety and lack of liquidity of these programs before investing.

                                        The DPP investor enjoys several advantages, including
                                         an investment managed by others;
                                         flow-through of income and certain expenses; and
                                         limited liability—the most the investors can lose is the amount of their investment plus
                                          any funds committed for, but not yet remitted.

                                        The exam will probably give more attention to the following disadvantages:
                                         Liquidity risk. The greatest disadvantage for a DPP investor is lack of liquidity. Because
                                          the secondary market for DPPs is limited, investors who want to sell their interests
                                          frequently cannot locate buyers.
                                         Legislative risk. When Congress changes tax laws, new rules can cause substantial
                                          damage to LPs, who may be locked into illiquid investments that lose previously assumed
                                          tax advantages.

                          Leverage risk. It is common for DPPs to use borrowed funds. Although the leverage
                           can boost returns, it can have the same effect on losses. The risk is even higher when
                           partnership uses recourse debt.
                          Risk of audit. Statistics from the IRS indicate that reporting ownership of a DPP results

                                                                                                                                    Unit 11
                           in a significantly higher percentage of returns selected for audit.
                          Depreciation recapture. One of the tax benefits is the ability to depreciate most fixed
                           assets, especially when that depreciation can be accelerated. The effect of the depreciation
                           deduction is to lower the tax basis of the asset. If that asset is then sold for more than that
                           basis, the excess is recaptured and subject to tax, possibly at ordinary income tax rates.
                           You won’t need to know anything more than the concept.


              LESSON 11.6: DPP REGULATION
                         LO 11.h Determine the rules and regulations pertaining to the sale of DPPs.



                         Introduction
                         As with the other investments we’ve discussed, there are common and specific regulations
                         relating to the issuance and sale of DPPs.


                         FINRA Rules Dealing with DPPs
                         FINRA Rule 2310 is specifically titled Direct Participation Programs. Many of the
                         requirements placed upon member firms and their representatives have been included where
                         relevant in this unit.


                         FINRA Rule 2310
                         Before participating in a DPP offering, member firms must have reasonable grounds for
                         believing, based on the information provided in the prospectus, that all material facts are
                         adequately disclosed and that these facts provide a framework for customers to evaluate the
                         program.


                         DPP Suitability
                         Under FINRA Rule 2310, all DPPs must have clearly stated standards of suitability in the
                         pro­spectus. In recommending a DPP to a customer, a member firm must be certain that the
                         pro­gram is consistent with the customer’s objectives and that the customer
                          is in a position to take full advantage of any tax benefits generated by the DPP; and
                          has a net worth sufficient to sustain the risks of the DPP, including loss of investment.
                         The member, after making a suitability determination, must maintain documents in its files
                         describing the basis on which the determination of suitability was made. In addition, no
                         member is permitted to execute a DPP transaction in a discretionary account without the
                         prior written consent of the customer.

                                        DPP Compensation Restrictions
                                        The rule places limits on the overall expenses and amount of broker-dealer compensation
                                        considered fair and reasonable. Specifically, if the organization and offering expenses exceed
                                        15% of the gross proceeds, FINRA considers that too high. A subset of those expenses is the
                                        compensation to the member firm. That cannot exceed 10% of the gross proceeds. Included
                                        in the 10% is any compensation to wholesalers.

                                                    EXAMPLE
                                                    A DPP offering is sold in units of $10,000. It is prohibited for any member firm to
                                                    participate in the offering if less than $8,500 is received by the issuer. Member
                                                    compensation, including all participants in the sales chain, cannot exceed $1,000.


                                        Noncash Compensation
                                        The rules on noncash compensation are the same as covered previously in Unit 8. For
                                        example, gifts cannot exceed $100 per year. An occasional meal or ticket to a sporting event
                                        would be permitted.


                                        DPP Roll-Up
                                        A roll-up is a transaction involving the combination or reorganization of one or more limited
                                        partnerships into securities of a successor corporation. The lure to investors is the pos­sibility
                                        of turning an illiquid DPP into a more liquid security.

                                     Answer: B. The maximum compensation to a member firm involved in the sale
                                     of a DPP is 10% of the gross proceeds. The rule permits an additional 5% for
                                     administrative, organization, and offering expenses. That brings the total maximum

              INTRODUCTION
                         When the subject is securities, we tend to limit ourselves to stocks and bonds, and perhaps
                         mutual funds as well. There are many other securities, but most of them tend to be limited
                         to sophisticated or high wealth investors. That is certainly true of the hedge fund. For those
                         investors with a higher level of sophistication, collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) and
                         collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) can be attractive alternatives to bonds.


              LESSON 12.1: HEDGE FUNDS

                         LO 12.a Determine the structure of hedge funds.



                         Hedge Fund Structure
                         Hedge fund structures are a form of fund generally organized as a limited partnership with no
                         more than 100 investors. That keeps the fund from having to register with the SEC. Because
                         there is no registration requirement, one of the differences between a mutual fund and a hedge
                         fund is the hedge fund’s lack of transparency. A mutual fund is offered via a prospectus filed




                                                                                                                       331

                                         with the SEC, while a hedge fund’s prospectus is generally referred to as a private placement
                                         memorandum containing significantly less information.

                                         It is important to recognize that hedge funds are not investment companies under the
                                         Investment Company Act of 1940. Their structure is such that they qualify for an exemption
                                         from the definition. This allows them flexibility that would not be possible as an investment
                                         company.

                                                     TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                     Most hedge funds are organized as limited partnerships with the portfolio managers
                                                     investing, along with the investors. As they say in the industry, they have “skin in the
                                                     game” so they have a greater motivation to succeed. The partnership is the issuer of
                                                     the ownership units.

                                                     PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                     1.      Which type of fund is most often organized as a limited partnership?

                                                             Answer: C. For various legal reasons, mostly related to the need to avoid
                                                             registration with the SEC, hedge funds are generally structured as limited

                                         Hedge Fund Characteristics

                                         Hedge Fund Strategies
                                         Hedge funds are similar to mutual funds in that investments are pooled and professionally
                                         managed, but they differ in that the fund has more flexibility in the investment strategies
                                         employed, and are unregulated by U.S. securities laws. They are aggressively-managed
                                         portfolios of investments that use advanced investment strategies. Generally, these investment
                                         vehicles are considered suitable for sophisticated investors—those meeting the standard of
                                         accredited investors. While hedging is the practice of attempting to limit risk, most hedge
                                         funds specify generating high returns as their primary investment objective. Some of the more
                                         common strategies employed by hedge funds are
                                          highly leveraged portfolios,
                                          the use of short positions,
                                          utilizing derivative products such as options and futures,
                                          currency speculation,
                                          commodity speculation, and
                                          investing in politically unstable international markets.

                       Because hedge funds—unlike mutual funds or investment companies—are unregulated, the
                       very nature of the investment is almost always considered speculative. Most also require that
                       investors maintain the investment for a minimum length of time (e.g., one year) and to that
                       extent they can be considered illiquid. These requirements are known as lock-up provisions.

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 Although hedge funds are unregulated, U.S. laws do require that most investors meet
                                 the test of a sophisticated investor. They should be considered accredited investors,
                                 having a minimum annual income and net worth, and have considerable investment
                                 knowledge if you want a recommendation to pass the Reg. BI standards.


                       Hedge Fund Lock-Up Provisions
                       This provision provides that during a certain initial period, an investor may not make a

                                                                                                                                     Unit 12
                       withdrawal from the fund. The period when the investor cannot withdraw investment dollars
                       is known as the lock-up period—the investor’s capital is locked up. Generally recognized as
                       one way the manager of the hedge fund portfolio can have capital retained in the fund, it is
                       also seen to be another factor adding to the unique risk of hedge funds—in this case, shares
                       being illiquid for that specified length of time.

                       Lock-up periods are generally associated with new or start-up hedge funds and can differ in
                       length from one fund to another. The length of the lock-up period will largely be dependent
                       on what the investment strategy of the fund is and how long the portfolio manager anticipates
                       it will take to implement the strategy and then see results of that implementation.


                       Hedge Fund Management Fees
                       Another important feature of hedge funds is that management fees tend to be considerably
                       higher than with other investments. Almost all hedge funds charge performance-based
                       fees. The typical fee structure is known by the vernacular 2 & 20—most funds take a 2%
                       management fee and 20% of any profits. This creates a strong incentive for the manager to
                       attempt to generate higher returns. As is true with all investments, the higher the potential
                       return, the greater the risk.

                       Therefore, because of the higher risk, investment in these vehicles is limited to institutional
                       clients and wealthy individuals, known as accredited investors.

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 2.   Which of the following characteristics do hedge funds share with mutual funds?
                                       A. A high degree of transparency
                                       B. Relatively low management costs
                                       C. A pooled investment with other investors
                                       D. High liquidity
                                      Answer: C. From what we’ve covered, you should have seen that hedge funds do
                                      not offer the transparency of mutual funds. The key to getting that point is that they
                                      are not registered with the SEC, so the disclosures that must be made are limited.
                                      The management fees for hedge funds are much higher than mutual funds and,
                                      because of the lock-up period, their liquidity is questionable. However, the common
                                      characteristic is that they are pooled investments.

                                         funds. They can target and diversify among several hedge funds and, in this way, give non-
                                         accredited investors access to hedge funds. These funds share some of the benefits and risks
                                         associated with hedge funds.

                                         One benefit is that lower initial investments are required than when investing directly in a
                                         hedge fund. In contrast, one risk to note is that like all mutual funds, the shares are not traded
                                         in the secondary markets. Selling your shares can only occur if the mutual fund company
                                         redeems them. Because the underlying assets are not liquid, this fund is not as liquid as other
                                         mutual funds. Another point to discuss with clients is that, in addition to the high hedge
                                         fund fees, investors also pay a management fee to the fund, just as with any mutual fund.
                                         Recommendations of funds of hedge funds would need to disclose the specific risks associated
                                         with hedge funds and the transfer of those risks that occurs when mutual funds invest in
                                         hedge funds.


                                         Blank-Check or Blind-Pool Hedge Fund
                                         Some hedge funds target blank-check companies to invest in. Blank-check companies,
                                         sometimes known as special purpose acquisition companies (SPACs), carry their own unique
                                         risks. Blank-check companies are companies without business operations that raise money
                                         through IPOs in order to have their shares publicly traded for the sole purpose of seeking
                                         out a business or combination of businesses. When a business is located, they will present
                                         proposals to holders of their shares for approval.

                                         Some hedge funds target blind-pool companies. Similar to blank-check companies, these
                                         issuers raise capital by selling securities to the public without telling investors what the specific
                                         use of the proceeds will be, but might target a particular industry or sector.

                                         Some characterize blank-check companies as a type of blind pool, with one discernable
                                         difference. While the blind-pool company will usually provide at least some indication of
                                         what general industry the funds will be invested in, blank-check offerings do not identify any
                                         proposed investment intent.

                                         While some hedge funds target these types of holdings for their portfolios, it should be noted
                                         that they might be included within any hedge fund portfolio and, in both cases, should be
                                         considered when assessing risk and determining suitability.


           LESSON 12.2: ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES
                                         LO 12.c Recall the different types of asset-backed securities.



                                         Types of Asset-Backed Securities (ABS)
                                         There are number of different types of asset-backed securities (ABS), but they all have one
                                         thing in common: their value and income payments are derived from or backed by a specific
                                         pool of underlying assets. These pools of assets can include expected payments from different
                                         types of loans such as mortgages—as is the case with CMOs—auto loans, or other types of




Series_7_2E.indb 334                                                                                                                      11/19/2021 7:53:46 PM
                                                                                     Unit 12   Other Securities Products     335


                       loans. In some instances, ABS can pool expected cash flow from credit cards, leases, or even
                       royalty payments.

                       Pooling the assets into financial instruments allows them to be sold to general investors more
                       easily than selling them individually. This process is called securitization, and it allows the risk
                       of investing in the underlying assets to be diversified, because each security will now represent
                       only a fraction of the total value of the diverse pool of underlying assets. The common theme
                       among all ABS is the contractual obligation to pay the debt.

                                  TAKE NOTE
                                  This is probably beyond the exam, but, this is for just in case FINRA decides to go
                                  deeper. The securitization process involves the creation of a special purpose entity
                                  (SPE). The title to the assets is transferred to the SPE. The SPE then issues the ABS
                                  using those assets as collateral.

                                                                                                                                      Unit 12
                       Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs)
                       CMOs pool a large number of mortgages, usually on single-family residences. CMOs are
                       issued by private-sector financing corporations and are often backed by Ginnie Mae, Fannie
                       Mae, and Freddie Mac pass-through securities. As a result, CMOs backed by government
                       agency securities have historically been highly rated.


                       Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDOs)
                       CDOs are complex ABS. CDOs do not specialize in any single type of debt. In almost all
                       cases, their portfolios consist of nonmortgage loans or bonds. The assets backing the CDOs
                       can be a pool of bonds, auto loans, or other assets such as leases, credit card debt, a company’s
                       receivables, or even derivative products of any of the assets listed. While the individual assets
                       may be small and not very liquid, pooling the assets facilitates them being sold to individual
                       investors in the secondary markets.


                       Amortizing and Nonamortizing CDOs
                       An amortizing loan is one in which regular payments are made against the principal. This
                       results in an investor’s return consisting of principal along with interest. At the end of the
                       term, the principal has been repaid. The most common examples of this in our everyday lives
                       are the mortgages on our homes or the loans on our automobiles. An auto loan CDO is the
                       classic example of an amortizing ABS.

                       A nonamortizing CDO is one backed by debt obligations without a fixed ending date. The
                       classic example of a nonamortizing ABS is the credit card CDO.

                       LO 12.d Recognize the special characteristics of asset-backed securities (ABS).



                       Characteristics of ABS
                       CMOs and CDOs have many similar characteristics. The exam tends to focus on CMOs, so
                       we will start there. If you find this confusing, FINRA understands that. In fact, any client of
                       a member firm wishing to invest in CMOs must complete a special suitability form. As you
                       work your way through our SecuritiesPro q-bank, you’ll catch on to the most tested items.

                                         Characteristics of CMOs
                                         CMOs pool a large number of mortgages, usually on single-family residences. A pool of
                                         mortgages is structured into maturity classes called tranches (the French word for slice).
                                         A CMO pays principal and interest from the mortgage pool monthly; however, it repays
                                         principal to only one tranche at a time.

                                         In addition to interest payments, investors in a short-term tranche must receive their entire
                                         principal before the next tranche begins to receive principal repayments. Principal payments
                                         are made in $1,000 increments to randomly selected bonds within a tranche. Changes in
                                         interest rates affect the rate of mortgage prepayments, and this, in turn, affects the flow of
                                         interest payment and principal repayment to the CMO investor.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     As you will learn, there are many different varieties of CMOs. We have just described
                                                     the plain vanilla CMO. As we stated, each of the tranches receives interest payment
                                                     simultaneously. However, it pays principal to only one tranche at a time until it is
                                                     retired. Subsequent principal payments are made to the next tranche in line until it is
                                                     paid off, and so on.
                                                     A CMO’s yield and maturity are estimates based on historical data or projections of
                                                     mortgage prepayments from the Public Securities Association (PSA). The particular
                                                     tranche an investor owns determines the priority of her principal repayment. The
                                                     time to maturity, amount of interest received, and amount of principal returned are
                                                     not guaranteed. The model developed by the PSA compensates for the fact that
                                                     prepayment assumptions will change during the life of an obligation and that this will
                                                     affect the yield of the security.

                                                             backs the mortgage).

                                                                                    Unit 12   Other Securities Products     337


                       Classes of CMOs
                       In addition to the standard CMOs discussed, some CMOs have been structured to suit
                       specific needs of investors. Common CMO types include
                        principal only,
                        interest only,
                        planned amortization class, and
                        targeted amortization class.


                       Principal Only CMOs (POs)
                       The flow of income from underlying mortgages is divided into principal and interest streams
                       and directed to the principal only CMOs (POs) owners and interest-only CMOs (IOs),
                       respectively. For a PO, the income stream comes from principal payments on the underlying
                       mortgages—both scheduled mortgage principal payments and prepayments. Thus, the                               Unit 12
                       security ultimately repays its entire face value to the investor.

                       A PO sells at a discount from par; the difference between the discounted price and the
                       principal value is the investor’s return. Its market value, like all deeply discounted securities,
                       tends to be volatile. POs, in particular, are affected by fluctuations in prepayment rates. The
                       value of a PO rises as interest rates drop and prepayments accelerate, and its value falls when
                       interest rates rise and prepayments decline.


                       Interest-Only CMOs (IOs)
                       IOs are by-products of POs. Whereas POs receive the principal stream from underlying
                       mortgages, IOs receive the interest. An IO also sells at a discount, and its cash flow declines
                       over time, just as the proportion of interest in a mortgage payment declines over time. Unlike
                       POs, IOs increase in value when interest rates rise, and they decline in value when interest
                       rates fall because the number of interest payments changes as prepayment rates change. Thus,
                       they can be used to hedge a portfolio against interest rate risk.

                       When prepayment rates are high, the owner of an IO may receive fewer interest payments
                       than anticipated. Because the entire CMO series receives more principal sooner, and therefore
                       less overall interest, the IO owner does not know how long the stream of interest payments
                       will last.


                       Planned Amortization Class CMOs (PACs)
                       PACs have targeted maturity dates; they are retired first and offer protection from
                       prepayment risk and extension risk (the chance that principal payments will be slower than
                       anticipated) because changes in prepayments are transferred to companion tranches, also
                       called support tranches.


                       Targeted Amortization Class CMOs (TACs)
                       A TAC structure transfers prepayment risk only to a companion tranche and does not offer
                       protection from extension risk. TAC investors accept the extension risk and the resulting
                       greater price risk in exchange for a slightly higher interest rate.

                                         Zero-Tranche CMO (Z-Tranche)
                                         A Z-tranche CMO receives no payment until all preceding CMO tranches are retired. These
                                         are the most volatile CMO tranches.

                                                     TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                     Z-tranche CMOs would not be suitable for an investor needing funds in a specified
                                                     amount of time, because of the unpredictable nature of when payment will be
                                                     received.


                                         CMO Risks
                                         Because mortgages back CMOs, they are considered relatively safe. However, their
                                         susceptibility to interest rate movements and the resulting changes in the mortgage repayment
                                         rate mean CMOs carry several risks:
                                          The rate of principal repayment varies.
                                          If interest rates fall and homeowner refinancing increases, principal is received sooner
                                           than anticipated (prepayment risk).
                                          If interest rates rise and refinancing declines, the CMO investor may have to hold his
                                           investment longer than anticipated (extended maturity risk). This is sometimes called
                                           extension risk.


                                         Other CMO Characteristics

                                         Returns on CMOs
                                         CMOs yield more than Treasury securities and normally pay investors interest and principal
                                         monthly. Principal repayments are made in $1,000 increments to investors in one tranche
                                         before any principal is repaid to the next tranche.


                                         Taxation
                                         Interest from CMOs is subject to federal, state, and local taxes.


                                         Liquidity
                                         There is an active secondary market for CMOs. Trading is done OTC. However, the market
                                         for CMOs with more complex characteristics may be limited or nonexistent. Certain tranches
                                         of a given CMO may be riskier than others, and some CMOs in certain tranches carry the
                                         risk that repayment of principal may take longer than anticipated.


                                         Denominations
                                         CMOs are issued in $1,000 denominations.

                       Suitability
                       Some varieties of CMOs, such as PAC companion tranches, may be particularly unsuitable for
                       small or unsophisticated investors because of their complexity and risks. The customer must
                       sign a suitability statement before buying any CMO. Potential investors must understand
                       that the rate of return on CMOs may vary because of early repayment. Also note that the
                       performance of CMOs may not be compared with any other investment vehicle.

                                 TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                 It will be useful to know the following summary:
                                     CMOs are not backed by the U.S. government; they are corporate instruments.
                                     Interest paid is taxable at all levels.
                                     CMOs are backed by mortgage pools.


                                                                                                                                     Unit 12
                                     CMOs yield more than U.S. Treasury securities.
                                     CMOs are subject to interest rate risk.
                                     CMOs are issued in $1,000 denominations and trade OTC.
                                     PACs have the least prepayment and extension risk.
                                     TACs are protected against prepayment risk but not extension risk.
                                 Because of the lower risk, PACs have lower yields than comparable TACs.

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 4.   Which of the following debt securities does not have a fixed maturity date?
                                       A. Collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO)
                                       B. General obligation (GO) bond
                                       C. Treasury STRIPS
                                       D. Subordinated debenture
                                      Answer: A. CMOs are mortgage-backed securities (MBS). Because mortgages are
                                      often paid off ahead of the scheduled maturity, the exact maturity date of a CMO is
                                      uncertain.


                       General Characteristics of CDOs
                       Similar in structure to CMOs, CDOs represent different types of debt and credit risk. Like
                       CMOs, the different types of debt and risk categories are often called tranches. Each tranche
                       has a different maturity and risk associated with it. The higher the risk, the more the CDO
                       pays. In practice, investors will choose a tranche with a risk-and-return combination that is
                       suitable for them.

                       Cautions when investing with CDOs should include the following:
                        Some CDOs are so complex that individual investors may not fully understand the
                         product and, therefore, do not understand what they are purchasing. While the
                         securitization of the assets easily enables their sale to individual investors, the product is
                         recognized as being more suitable to institutional or sophisticated investors.
                        The sale of the individual assets from the originators of the loans to those who are
                         repackaging them allows the originators to avoid having to collect on them when they
                         become due because they are now owned by someone else. In this case, the issuer of the




Series_7_2E.indb 339                                                                                                      11/19/2021 7:53:47 PM

                                              CDO owns the assets. In turn, this may lead to originators of loans being less judicious
                                              and disciplined in adhering to sound lending practices when the loans are made.
                                          FINRA has found that a significant percentage of registered representatives selling CDOs
                                           do not understand them. Member firms have been fined for failure to supervise and the
                                           reps are often fined and/or suspended. If this is a product you will be recommending,

              INTRODUCTION
                         By analyzing an investment portfolio and analyzing an account, products may be selected to fit
                         the needs of the customer. One of the important items to consider is the performance of various
                         securities that are recommended.

                         The securities and performance measures will depend on the information gathered and the
                         customer’s investment experience. Aggressive investors may try timing the market and seek
                         capital appreciation.

                                    EXAMPLE
                                    A customer may like moving in and out of the market. If trading a lot, it would be
                                    important to know whether market prices are going up, have started to slide, or seem
                                    to have reached a plateau. On the other hand, a buy-and-hold investor may be more
                                    concerned about the stock’s value 15–20 years in the future, and is likely to be more

                                                     interested in whether it has a pattern of earnings growth and seems to be well-
                                                     positioned for future expansion.
                                        With a conservative investor or one who is approaching retirement, the primary concern may
                                        be the income your investments provide. An examination of the interest rate that bonds and
                                        CDs are paying in relation to current market rates would be important. An evaluation of
                                        the yield from stock and mutual funds bought for the income they provide is important. Of
                                        course, if market rates are down, reinvestment opportunities may disappoint as existing bonds
                                        mature. There may be a temptation to buy investments with a lower rating in expectation of
                                        getting a potentially higher return. In either event, a performance measure that assesses the
                                        risk to the results would be helpful when making investment decisions.

                                        In measuring investment performance, be sure to avoid comparing apples to oranges.
                                        Finding and applying the right evaluation standards for investments is important. Otherwise,
                                        the wrong conclusions may result.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     There’s little reason to compare yield from a growth mutual fund with yield from a
                                                     Treasury bond, because they don’t fulfill the same role in a portfolio. Instead, one
                                                     measures performance for a growth fund by comparing it to other growth-oriented
                                                     investments, such as a growth fund index or an equity market index

                                        Diversification, with its emphasis on variety, allows the spreading of assets around. In short,
                                        don’t put all your investment eggs in one basket. Where your spread those assets is critical.
                                        That is what asset allocation is all about.

                                        Asset allocation (more accurately, but rarely stated, asset class allocation) refers to the
                                        spreading of portfolio funds among different asset classes with difference risk-and-return
                                        characteristics, based on the investment policy statement. Proponents of asset allocation feel
                                        that the mix of assets within a portfolio, rather than individual stock selection or market
                                        timing, is the primary factor underlying the variability of returns in portfolio performance.
                                        There are three major types (each with subclasses) of asset classes:
                                         Stock, with subclasses based on market capitalization, value versus growth, and foreign
                                          equity
                                         Bonds, with subclasses based on maturity (intermediate versus long-term), and issuer
                                          (Treasury versus corporate versus non-U.S. issuers)
                                         Cash, focusing mainly on the standard risk-free investment, the 91‑day (13 week)
                                          Treasury bill, but also including other short-term money market instruments

                                        Proper asset allocation takes into consideration the investor’s desire for preservation of capital,
                                        income, capital growth, or a combination of all of these.

                                        In some instances, tangible assets, such as real estate (usually in the form of REITs), precious
                                        metals, and other commodities, and certain collectibles (think fine art), are part of the asset

                       allocation because these types of assets tend to reduce inflation risk. Increasingly, institutional
                       investors (and some very high net worth individuals because of the high cost of entry) are
                       using such alternative investment asset classes as ETNs, private equity, and venture capital.
                       It is important to understand that asset allocation is not simply spreading the money around
                       helter-skelter to different asset classes—there is a process.

                       One form of diversification popular with municipal bond investors is geographic. That is, the
                       portfolio is constructed with bonds issued from different areas of the country.


                       Strategic Asset Allocation
                       Strategic asset allocation refers to the proportion of various types of investments composing
                       a long-term investment portfolio. This is a passive strategy.

                                  EXAMPLE
                                  A standard asset allocation model suggests subtracting a person’s age from 100 to
                                  determine the percentage of the portfolio to be invested in stocks. According to this
                                  method, a 30-year-old would be 70% invested in stocks and 30% in bonds and cash; a
                                  70-year-old would be invested 30% in stocks with the remainder in bonds and cash.
                       Over time, the portfolio is rebalanced to bring the asset mix back to the target allocations.
                       If the stock market should perform better than expected, the client’s proportion of stocks to
                       bonds would be out of balance. So, on some timely basis (perhaps quarterly), stocks would
                       be sold and bonds would be purchased (or funds would be placed in cash) to bring the
                       proportions back to the desired levels.

                                                                                                                                              Unit 13
                       Tactical Asset Allocation
                       Tactical asset allocation refers to short-term portfolio adjustments that adjust the portfolio
                       mix between asset classes in consideration of current market conditions. This is an active
                       strategy.

                                  TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                  In Lesson 1.1, we discussed the fee-based account. Those who practice tactical asset
                                  allocation, buying and selling to try to “time the market,” are candidates for that type
                                  of account. A fee-based account is likely to be unsuitable for one using strategic asset
                                  allocation.

                       Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)
                       Managing risk is about the allocation and diversification of holdings in a portfolio.
                       Investments should be chosen with an eye to what is already owned and how the new
                       investment helps achieve greater balance.

                       For example, an investment strategy might include some investments that may be volatile
                       because they have the potential to increase dramatically in value, when other investments in
                       your portfolio are unlikely to have the same potential.

                                         Modern portfolio theory (MPT) employs a scientific approach to measuring risk and,
                                         by extension, to choosing investments. It involves calculating projected returns of various
                                         portfolio combinations to identify those that are likely to provide the best returns at different
                                         levels of risk. It is the concept of minimizing risk by combining volatile and price-stable
                                         investments in a single portfolio.

                                         Harry Markowitz, the founder of MPT, explained how to best assemble a diversified portfolio
                                         and proved that the portfolio with a lower amount of volatility would do better than a
                                         portfolio with a greater amount of volatility. This concept appeals to those with a lower risk
                                         tolerance, i.e., risk averse.

                                         MPT focuses on the relationships among all the investments in a portfolio. This theory holds
                                         that specific risks can be diversified by building portfolios of securities whose returns are
                                         not correlated. MPT seeks to reduce the risk in a portfolio while simultaneously increasing
                                         expected returns.

                                         Holding securities that tend to move in the same direction as one another does not lower an
                                         investor’s risk. Diversification reduces risk only when assets whose prices move inversely, or at
                                         different times, in relation to one another are combined.
                                         In other words, MPT wants securities in a portfolio to have negative correlation, not
                                         positive correlation. Perfect negative correlation is –1.0 and would indicate that if one
                                         security goes up, the other security would go down the same amount. Obviously, this is not
                                         an exact science, but it is an indication of the movement of the portfolio.

                                         Some analysis tools that are used in MPT include the following terms.


                                         Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)
                                         The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is used to calculate the return that an investment
                                         should achieve based on the risk that is taken. The more risk taken, the higher the potential
                                         returns. Investors should be rewarded for the risk they take. CAPM calculates a required
                                         return based on a risk multiplier called the beta coefficient.

                                         A portfolio’s total risk is made up of nonsystematic (unsystematic) risk and systematic risk.
                                         Those risks are covered in the next unit—you might want to take a quick look at them now. If
                                         an investor has a diversified portfolio, nonsystematic risk is reduced to almost zero. Therefore,
                                         the only real risk is systematic risk, and this is the risk that needs a required return.
                                         Investors with a well-diversified portfolio will find that the risk affecting the portfolio is
                                         wholly systematic (markets moving together). Individual investments have both systematic
                                         and unsystematic risk; however, in a portfolio that is diversified, only the systematic risk of a
                                         new security would be relevant.

                                         In other words, if an individual investment becomes part of a well-diversified portfolio, the
                                         unsystematic risk can be ignored.

                                                            under the modern portfolio theory?

                                       Answer: B. Market risk, sometimes referred to as systematic risk, cannot be
                                       diversified away. The risk of investing in a single industry or sector can be diversified
                                       away by investing in several industries with returns not correlated to one another.
                                       A general downturn in the market, however, cannot be eliminated through
                                       diversification.


                       Beta Coefficient
                       Beta and beta coefficient mean the same thing. In the securities industry, the word coefficient
                       is ordinarily dropped for purposes of convenience. A stock or portfolio’s beta is a measure of
                       its volatility in relation to the overall market (systematic risk). The overall market is typically
                       based on the S&P 500. A security that has a beta of one moves in line with the market. A
                       security or portfolio with a beta of greater than one is generally going to be more volatile than
                       the overall market. The reverse is true when the beta is less than one.

                       A security that does not move in relation to market movement would have a beta of zero. For
                       example, a money market security or money market mutual fund would have a beta of close
                       to zero.

                                  TAKE NOTE
                                  If the S&P 500 rises or falls by 10%, a stock with a beta of one rises or falls by about
                                  10%, a stock with a beta of 1.5 rises or falls by about 15%, and a stock with a beta of
                                  0.75 rises or falls by about 7.5%.

                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                  2.   Adding investments with a negative beta to a well-diversified portfolio that currently                  Unit 13
                                       has a beta of +1.0 will cause
                                        A. the expected performance of the portfolio to improve in declining markets.
                                        B. the expected performance of the portfolio to decline in declining markets.
                                        C. the portfolio to experience more volatility in times of a rising market.
                                        D. the portfolio to experience more volatility in times of a declining market.
                                       Answer: A. A negative beta means that the investment will move in an opposite
                                       direction from the overall market. Therefore, if the market is declining, then the
                                       asset should increase in value, thereby increasing the expected performance of the
                                       portfolio.


                       Alpha
                       Analysts advise when to buy, sell, or hold securities. The CAPM is a method that analysts may
                       use to make these decisions. Based on its beta, an analyst would calculate the expected return
                       for the security. Alpha is the extent to which an asset’s or portfolio’s return exceeds or falls
                       short of its expected return. A positive alpha would indicate a buy recommendation.

                                  EXAMPLE
                                  If an investment has a beta of 1.5, it is 50% more volatile than the market. Therefore, if
                                  the market goes up 10%, it is expected that the investment with a beta of 1.5 will go up
                                  15%.
                                  However, if the investment only goes up 11%, the investor took a greater risk for less
                                  return on their money. So the return of 11% is less than the 15% expected return
                                  (negative alpha).

                                                      If the investment increased by 17%, the investor received a greater return than the risk
                                                      taken. So the return of 17% is greater than the expected return of 15% (positive alpha).
                                                      The CAPM calculation of alpha would replace the expected return with the required
                                                      return. You will not have to compute alpha on the exam. Just understand the concept.

                                                      TAKE NOTE
                                                      A positive alpha, rather than a negative one, is desirable.

                                                      PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                      3.    When looking at the alpha of a particular investment, you notice it is a negative
                                                            number, and that indicates
                                                             A. the investment lost money.
                                                             B. the investor took more risk than the return received.
                                                             C. the investment is not volatile.
                                                             D. a very efficient portfolio manager.
                                                            Answer: B. Alpha measures the extent to which the return exceeded or fell below the
                                                            expected return for the risk taken. When the alpha is negative, the investor’s return
                                                            was too low for the risk taken.


           LESSON 13.2: FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS WITH FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                                         fundamental analysis.



                                         Introduction
                                         Fundamental analysis is the study of the business prospects of an individual company within
                                         the context of its industry and the overall economy. They do this by examining the company
                                         in detail, including the financial statements and company management. We could compare
                                         this to an individual receiving a full physical examination that, in addition to all kinds of tests,
                                         would include a detailed family medical history. With a company, the financial statement
                                         analysis is like the blood tests, x-rays, stress tests, and so forth, and the evaluation of the
                                         company’s management is like the medical history.


                                         Financial Statements
                                         A corporation’s financial statements provide a fundamental analyst with the information
                                         needed to assess that corporation’s profitability, liquidity, financial strength (ability of cash
                                         flow to meet debt payments), and operating efficiency. By examining how certain numbers
                                         from one statement relate to prior statements, and how the resulting ratios relate to the
                                         company’s competitors, the analyst can determine how financially viable the company is.

                                         Companies issue quarterly and annual financial reports to the SEC. A company’s balance
                                         sheet and income statement are included in these reports.


                                         What is a Balance Sheet?
                                         The balance sheet provides a snapshot of a company’s financial position at a specific point
                                         in time. It identifies the value of the company’s assets (what it owns) and its liabilities (what




Series_7_2E.indb 346                                                                                                                            11/19/2021 7:53:48 PM
                                              Unit 13   Portfolio or Account Analysis and Its Application to Security Selection     347


                       it owes). The difference between these two figures is the corporation’s owners’ equity, or net
                       worth.

                       The balance sheet equation is
                        assets – liabilities = owners’ equity; or
                        assets = liabilities + owners’ equity.
                       Although it is useful in determining a company’s current value, the balance sheet does not
                       indicate whether the company’s business is improving or deteriorating. The balance sheet
                       gets its name from the fact that its two sides must balance. The balance sheet equation
                       mathematically expresses the relationship between its two sides. Simply stated, everything that
                       is owned (assets) minus everything that is owed (liabilities) is equal to the net worth (owners’
                       or shareholders’ equity) of the entity.


                       Assets
                       Assets appear on the balance sheet in order of liquidity, which is the ease with which they can
                       be turned into cash. Assets that are most readily convertible into cash are listed first, followed
                       by less liquid assets. Balance sheets commonly identify three types of assets: current assets
                       (cash and assets easily convertible into cash), fixed assets (physical assets that could eventually
                       be sold), and other assets (usually intangible and only of value to the corporation that owns
                       them).


                       Current Assets

                                                                                                                                              Unit 13
                       Current assets include all cash and other items expected to be converted into cash within the
                       next 12 months, including the following:
                        Cash and equivalents include cash and short-term safe investments, such as money market
                         instruments that can be readily sold, as well as other marketable securities.
                        Accounts receivable include amounts due from customers for goods delivered or services
                         rendered, reduced by the allowance for bad debts.
                        Inventory is the cost of raw materials, work in process, and finished goods ready for sale.
                        Prepaid expenses are items a company has already paid for but has not yet benefited from,
                         such as prepaid advertising, rents, insurance, and operating supplies.


                       Fixed Assets
                       Fixed assets are property, plant, and equipment. Unlike current assets, they are not easily
                       converted into cash. Fixed assets, such as factories, have limited useful lives because wear and
                       tear eventually reduce their value. For this reason, their cost can be depreciated over time or
                       deducted from taxable income in annual installments to compensate for loss in value.


                       Other Assets
                       Intangible assets are nonphysical properties, such as formulas, brand names, contract rights,
                       and trademarks. Goodwill, also an intangible asset, reflects the corporation’s reputation and
                       relationship with its clients.

                                                      TAKE NOTE
                                                      Although intangible assets may have great value to the corporation owning them, they
                                                      generally carry little value to other entities.


                                         Liabilities
                                         Total liabilities on a balance sheet represent all financial claims by creditors against the
                                         corporation’s assets. Balance sheets usually include two main types of liabilities: current
                                         liabilities and long-term liabilities.


                                         Current Liabilities
                                         Current liabilities are corporate debt obligations due for payment within the next 12 months.
                                         These include the following:
                                          Accounts payable. Amounts owed to suppliers of materials and other business costs.
                                          Accrued wages payable. Unpaid wages, salaries, commissions, and interest.
                                          Current long-term debt. Any portion of long-term debt due within 12 months.
                                          Notes payable. The balance due on equipment purchased on credit or cash borrowed.
                                          Accrued taxes. Unpaid federal, state, and local taxes.


                                         Long-Term Liabilities
                                         Long-term liabilities are financial obligations due for payment after 12 months. Examples
                                         include bonds and mortgages.

                                                      TAKE NOTE
                                                      Long-term debts include mortgages on real property and outstanding corporate
                                                      bonds.


                                         What is an Income Statement?
                                         The income statement, sometimes called the profit and loss or P&L statement, summarizes
                                         a company’s revenues (sales) and expenses for a fiscal period, usually quarterly, year to
                                         date, or the full year. It compares revenue against costs and expenses during the period.
                                         Fundamental analysts use the income statement to judge the efficiency and profitability of a
                                         company’s operation. Just as with the balance sheet, technical analysts generally ignore this
                                         information—it is not relevant to their charting schemes.


                                         Components of the Income Statement
                                         A discussion of the various operating and nonoperating expenses on the income statement
                                         follows.

                                         Revenues indicate the firm’s total sales during the period (the money that came in).

                                         The cost of goods sold (COGS) is the costs of labor, material, and production (including
                                         depreciation on assets employed in production) used to create finished goods. Subtracting
                                         COGS from revenues shows the gross operating profit. The two major methods of accounting
                                         for material costs are the first in, first out method (FIFO) and last in, first out method
                                         (LIFO). Under LIFO accounting, COGS normally will reflect higher costs of more recently




Series_7_2E.indb 348                                                                                                                    11/19/2021 7:53:48 PM
                                              Unit 13   Portfolio or Account Analysis and Its Application to Security Selection     349


                       purchased inventory (last items in). As a result of higher reported production costs under
                       LIFO, reported income is reduced. The opposite is true if the FIFO method is used.

                       Pretax margin is determined by subtracting COGS and other operating costs (rent and
                       utilities) from sales to arrive at net operating profit. The resulting figure is earnings before
                       interest and taxes (EBIT).

                       Interest payments on a corporation’s debt is not considered an operating expense. However,
                       interest payments reduce the corporation’s taxable income. Pretax income, the amount of
                       taxable income, is operating income less interest payment expenses.

                       If dividends are paid to stockholders, they are paid out of net income after taxes have been
                       paid. After dividends have been paid, the remaining income is added to retained earnings and
                       is available to invest in the business.

                                  TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                  Please note the previous three terms in boldface. Revenue (or sales), COGS, and pretax
                                  income are the three primary components of an income statement.
                                  Think of it simply like this: the income statement shows (1) what came in, (2) what
                                  went out, and (3) how much is left (before taxes).

                                  TAKE NOTE
                                  Interest payments reduce a corporation’s taxable income, whereas dividend payments
                                  to stockholders are paid from after-tax dollars. Because they are taxable as income to
                                  stockholders, dividends are taxed twice, whereas interest payments are taxed once as
                                                                                                                                              Unit 13
                                  income to the recipient.


                       Accounting for Depreciation
                       As mentioned earlier, when reviewing the balance sheet, fixed assets are shown at their cost
                       minus accumulated depreciation. For these assets, which wear out over time, tax law requires
                       that the loss of value be deducted over the asset’s useful life, longer for some assets, shorter
                       for others (you won’t have to know depreciation schedules). On the income statement, the
                       allowable portion for the year is shown as an expense and, for our purposes, will generally be
                       part of COGS. Remember, if the company uses accelerated depreciation, the expenses will be
                       higher in the early years, resulting in lower pretax income (and lower-income taxes) but higher
                       income later on.

                                         Shareholder Equity

                                         company’s assets after all its creditors have been paid. Shareholder equity equals total assets
                                         less total liabilities. On a balance sheet, three types of shareholder equity are identified: capital
                                         stock at par, capital in excess of par, and retained earnings.

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 net worth = total assets – total liabilities


                       Capital Stock at Par
                       Capital stock includes preferred and common stock, listed at par value. Par value is the total
                       dollar value assigned to stock certificates when a corporation’s owners (the stockholders) first
                       contributed capital. Par value of common stock is an arbitrary value with no relationship to
                       market price.


                       Capital in Excess of Par
                       Capital in excess of par, often called additional paid-in capital or paid-in surplus, is the
                       amount of money over par value that a company received for issuing the stock in a primary
                       offering. The par value is an arbitrary amount selected when the company is formed. In
                       virtually all instances, the price of the stock when it is initially issued is above the par.


                       Retained Earnings
                       Retained earnings, sometimes called earned surplus or accumulated earnings, are profits that
                       have not been paid out in dividends. Retained earnings represent the total of all earnings held
                       since the corporation was formed, less dividends paid to stockholders. Operating losses in any
                       year reduce the retained earnings from prior years.



                                                                                                                                              Unit 13
                       Capital Structure
                       A company’s capitalization is the combined sum of its long-term debt and equity securities.
                       The capital structure is the relative amounts of debt and equity that compose a company’s
                       capitalization. Some companies finance their business with a large proportion of borrowed
                       funds; others finance growth with retained earnings from normal operations and little or no
                       debt.
                       Looking at the balance sheet, a corporation builds its capital structure with equity and debt,
                       including the following four elements:
                        Long-term debt (bonds and debentures)
                        Capital stock (common and preferred)
                        Capital in excess of par (paid-in or capital surplus)
                        Retained earnings (earned surplus)

                                                      The total capitalization on the sample balance is $90 million ($50 million in long-
                                                      term debt, $20 million in preferred stock, and $20 million in common shareholders’
                                                      equity). Remember, capital stock + capital surplus + retained earnings = net worth
                                                      (shareholders’ equity).

                                         If a company changes its capitalization by issuing stock or bonds, the effects will show up on
                                         the balance sheet.


                                         Liquidity Calculations
                                         The following computations help a financial analyst determine the ability of a company to
                                         meet its current obligations.


                                         Working Capital
                                         Working capital is the amount of capital or cash a company has available. Working capital is
                                         a measure of a firm’s liquidity, which is its ability to quickly turn assets into cash to meet its
                                         short-term obligations.

                                         The formula for working capital is:

                                                current assets – current liabilities = working capital

                                         Factors that affect working capital include
                                          increases in working capital, such as profits, sale of securities (long-term debt or equity),
                                           and sale of noncurrent assets; and
                                          decreases in working capital, such as declaring a cash dividend, paying off long-term debt,
                                           and net loss.


                                         Current Ratio
                                         Knowing the amount of working capital is useful, but it becomes an even better indicator
                                         when paired with the current ratio. This computation uses the same two items—current
                                         assets and current liabilities—but expresses them as a ratio of one to the other. Simply divide
                                         the current assets by the current liabilities, and the higher the ratio, the more liquid the
                                         company is.


                                         Quick Asset Ratio (Acid-Test Ratio)
                                         Sometimes it is important for the analyst to use an even stricter test of a company’s ability
                                         to meet its short-term obligations (such as, “pass the acid test”). The quick asset ratio uses
                                         the company’s quick assets instead of all of the current assets. Quick assets are current assets




Series_7_2E.indb 352                                                                                                                        11/19/2021 7:53:48 PM

                       minus the inventory. Then divide these quick assets by the current liabilities to arrive at the
                       quick ratio.

                                  TAKE NOTE
                                  Liquidity measures a company’s ability to pay the expenses associated with running
                                  the business.


                       Leverage
                       Financial leverage is a company’s ability to use long-term debt to increase its return on
                       equity. A company with a high ratio of long-term debt-to-equity is said to be highly leveraged.

                       Stockholders benefit from leverage if the return on borrowed money exceeds the debt service
                       costs. But leverage is risky because excessive increases in debt raise the possibility of default in
                       a business downturn.

                       In general, industrial companies with debt-to-equity ratios of 50% or higher are considered
                       highly leveraged. However, utilities, with their relatively stable earnings and cash flows, can be
                       more highly leveraged without subjecting stockholders to undue risk. If a company is highly
                       leveraged, it is also affected more by changes in interest rates.

                       The best way to measure the amount of financial leverage being employed by the company is
                       by calculating the debt-to-equity ratio. It is really a misnomer—it should be called the debt-
                                                                                                                                              Unit 13
                       to-total capitalization ratio because that is what it is. For example, using the numbers in the
                       capitalization example, we see that the total capital employed in the business is $90 million.
                       Of that, $50 million is long-term debt. So, we want to know how much of the $90 million
                       total is represented by debt capital. The answer is simple: $50 million of the $90 million,
                       or 55.55%. That is the debt-to-equity ratio, and it indicates that this is a highly leveraged
                       company (over 50%).


                       Book Value Per Share
                       A fundamental analyst is described as one who focuses on the company’s books. Therefore,
                       one of the key numbers computed is the book value per share. The calculation is almost
                       identical to one we have already studied—net asset value (NAV) per share of an investment
                       company.

                       In the case of a corporation, it is basically the liquidation value of the enterprise. That is,
                       let’s assume we sold all of our assets, paid back everyone we owe, and then split what is left
                       among the stockholders. But remember, before we can hand over anything to the common
                       shareholders, we must take care of any outstanding preferred stock. So, from the funds that
                       are left after we pay off all the liabilities, we give the preferred shareholders back their par (or
                       stated) value and the rest belongs to the common stockholders.

                       But, there is one more thing. In the case of liquidation, some of the assets on our books
                       might not really be worth what we’re carrying them at—in particular, those that are known as
                       intangible assets (goodwill, patents, trademarks, copyrights, etc.). That is why the analyst uses
                       only the tangible assets, computed by subtracting those intangibles from the total assets.

                                         Expressed as a formula, book value per share is:

                                                 tangible assets – liabilities – par value of preferred
                                                                                                        = book value per share

                                         Balancing the Balance Sheet
                                         Balance sheets, by definition, must balance. Every financial change in a business requires two
                                         offsetting changes on the company books, known as double-entry bookkeeping. For example,
                                         when a company pays a previously declared cash dividend, cash (a current asset) is reduced
                                         while dividends payable (a current liability of the same amount) is eradicated. This results in
                                         no change to working capital or net worth because each side of the balance sheet has been
                                         lowered by the same amount.


                                         Depreciating Assets
                                         Because fixed assets (e.g., buildings, equipment, and machinery) wear out as they are used,
                                         they decline in value over time. This decline in value is called depreciation. A company’s tax
                                         bills are reduced each year the company depreciates fixed assets used in the businesses.

                                         Depreciation affects the company in two ways: accumulated depreciation reduces the value
                                         of fixed assets on the balance sheet, and the annual depreciation deduction reduces taxable
                                         income on the income statement.

                                         Companies may elect either straight-line or accelerated depreciation. By use of the straight-
                                         line method, a company depreciates fixed assets by an equal amount each year over the asset’s
                                         useful life. A piece of equipment costing $1 million with a 10-year useful life will generate a
                                         depreciation deduction of $100,000 per year.

                                         Accelerated depreciation is a method that depreciates fixed assets more during the earlier years
                                         of their useful life and less during the later years.

                                                      TAKE NOTE
                                                      Compared with straight-line, accelerated depreciation generates larger deductions
                                                      (lower taxable income) during the early years and smaller deductions (higher taxable
                                                      income) during the later years.


                                         Footnotes
                                         Footnotes to the financial statements identify significant financial and management issues
                                         that may affect the company’s overall performance, such as accounting methods used,
                                         extraordinary items, pending litigation, and management philosophy.

                                         Typically, a company separately discloses details about its long-term debt in the footnotes.
                                         These disclosures are useful for determining the timing and amount of future cash outflows.
                                         The disclosures usually include a discussion of the nature of the liabilities, maturity dates,
                                         stated and effective interest rates, call provisions and conversion privileges, restrictions
                                         imposed by creditors, assets pledged as security, and the amount of debt maturing in each of
                                         the next five years.

                                         Also disclosed in the footnotes would be off-the-books financing arrangements, such as debt
                                         guarantees.

                                                       Footnotes are generally found on the bottom of the financial statements and can be
                                                       several pages long.

                                                       The balance sheet reports what resources (assets) a company owns and how it
                                                       has funded them. How the firm has financed the assets is revealed by the capital
                                                       structure—for example, long-term debt and owners’ equity (preferred stock, common
                                                       stock, and retained earnings).


                                          Income Statement Computations
                                          There are a number of important ratios that can be computed using information from the
                                          income statement. We’ll take a look at several of them.


                                          Earnings Per Share (EPS)
                                          Among the most widely used statistics, earnings per share (EPS) measures the value of a
                                          company’s earnings for each common share:

                                                          earnings available to common

                                          Earnings available to common are the remaining earnings after the preferred dividend has
                                          been paid. EPS relates to common stock only. Preferred stockholders have no claims to
                                          earnings beyond the stipulated preferred stock dividends.                                                               Unit 13

                                         Current Yield (Dividend Yield)
                                         A common stock’s current yield (CY), like the CY on bonds, expresses the annual income
                                         payout (dividends rather than interest) as a percentage of the current stock price:

                                                         annual dividends per common share

                                         The dividend payout ratio measures the proportion of earnings paid to stockholders as
                                         dividends:

                                                                                annual dividends per common share

                                         In general, older companies pay out larger percentages of earnings as dividends. Utilities as a
                                         group have an especially high payout ratio. Growth companies normally have the lowest ratios
                                         because they reinvest their earnings in the businesses. Companies on the way up hope to
                                         reward stockholders with gains in the stock value rather than with high dividend income.

                                         The statement of cash flow reports a business’s sources and uses of cash and the beginning
                                         and ending values for cash and cash equivalents each year. The three components generating

                                                       to the company’s net income to determine the cash flow. As described previously, the
                                                       cash flow statement will also reflect money from operations, financing, and investing,
                                                       but not accounting changes.

                                                       EXAMPLE
                                                       Sometimes, using numbers makes this concept much easier. If you take a look at the
                                                       income statement we reviewed a few pages ago, you will see that this company’s net
                                                       income (bottom line, to use the vernacular) was $2.25 million. Among the $6 million
                                                       in expenses deducted from the total revenues was $500,000 of depreciation. However,
                                                       the company never “wrote a check” for that money; it is the amount of the original
                                                       cost that it is allowed to be written off as an expense each year as the fixed assets wear
                                                       out. So, not only does the company have the net income remaining after all expenses
                                                       and taxes, but also it had another $500,000 in funds it could use, giving the company a
                                                       total cash flow of $2.75 million.

                                       Earnings Before Interest and Taxes (EBIT)
                                       EBIT helps a fundamental analyst to evaluate a company’s performance without incorporating
                                       interest expenses or income tax rates. Without accounting for interest or taxes that are
                                       variables for every company, the fundamental analyst can focus on operating profitability as a
                                       single measure of success.

                                       This is very important when comparing companies within an industry that have different debt
                                       obligations or tax obligations.

                                       It is calculated from information found on the income statement.

                            Example: ABC Corp.
               Sales revenue              $10 million
               Expenses                   8 million
               EBIT                       2 million
               Interest paid              500,000
               Earnings before taxes      1.5 million
               Income taxes               60,000
               Net income                 $1.44 million


                                       Earnings Before Taxes (EBT)
                                       With EBIT, the analyst has taken out the tax structure when evaluating a company in an
                                       industry—once again, making it easier to compare companies within an industry. Note that
                                                                                                                                                              Unit 13
                                       a highly leveraged company will have a relatively higher interest expense, and a lower EBT
                                       when compared to a company with less debt obligations.


                                       Price-to-Earnings Ratio
                                       The widely used price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio provides investors with a rough idea of the
                                       relationship between the prices of different common stocks compared with the earnings that
                                       accrue to one share of stock.

                                                           current market price of a common share
                                            P/E ratio =
                                                                            EPS
                                       Growth companies usually have higher P/E ratios than cyclical companies. Investors are
                                       willing to pay more per dollar of current earnings if a company’s future earnings are expected
                                       to be dramatically higher than earnings for stocks that rise and fall with business cycles.
                                       Companies subject to cyclical fluctuations generally sell at lower P/Es; declining industries
                                       sell at still lower P/Es. Investors should beware of extremely high or extremely low P/Es.
                                       Speculative stocks often sell at one extreme or the other.

                                       If a stock’s market price and P/E ratio are known, the EPS can be calculated as follows:

                                                      current market price of common stock
                                            EPS =
                                                                    P/E ratio

                                         Growth vs. Value
                                         One of the longest running arguments in investment analysis is, "which is more successful,
                                         the growth style or the value style?" The father of value investing was Benjamin Graham and
                                         his text Security Analysis (co-authored with David Dodd) is still widely read today. The exam
                                         won't ask you about Graham and Dodd, but will want you to know the essential features of
                                         both styles.


                                         Growth Style
                                         Portfolio managers using the growth style of portfolio management focus on stocks of
                                         companies whose earnings are growing faster than most other stocks and are expected to
                                         continue to do so. Because rapid growth in earnings is often priced into the stocks, growth
                                         investment managers are likely to buy stocks that are at the high end of their 52-week price
                                         range. Therefore, in the eyes of some, they might be buying stocks that are overvalued.


                                         Value Style
                                         Portfolio managers using the value style of management concentrate on undervalued or out-
                                         of-favor securities whose price is low relative to the company’s earnings or book value and
                                         whose earnings prospects are believed to be unattractive by investors and securities analysts.
                                         In fact, sometimes value managers think they can find a bargain with companies that are
                                         currently operating at a loss (no earnings, hence no P/E ratio). Value investment managers
                                         seek to buy undervalued securities before the company reports positive earnings surprises.
                                         Their primary source of information is the company’s financial statements. Value investment
                                         managers are more likely to buy stocks that are at the bottom of their 52-week price range.

                                                      TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                      Growth managers expect to see high P/E ratios (price to earnings ratios) or high price-
                                                      to-book ratio with little or no dividends. On the other hand, value managers expect
                                                      to see a low P/E ratio or low price-to-book ratio and dividends offering a reasonable
                                                      yield.

                                         LO 13.e Recall market analysis considerations and their use in technical analysis.



                                         Introduction
                                         Both technical and fundamental analyses attempt to predict the supply and demand of
                                         markets and individual stocks. As shown earlier, fundamental analysts concentrate on broad-
                                         based economic trends; current business conditions within an industry; and the quality of a
                                         particular corporation’s business, finances, and management.

                                         Technical analysis attempts to predict the direction of prices on the basis of historic price and
                                         trading volume patterns when laid out graphically on charts.

                                    Trading Volume
                                    Technical analysts view changes in the trading volume of a stock to be an important predictor
                                    of future price movements. A significant change to the trading volume (up or down) sends a
                                    signal to the technician that a trend may be starting.


                                    Support and Resistance Levels
                                    Stock prices may move within a narrow range for months or even years. The bottom of
                                    this trading range is known as the support level; the top of the trading range is called the
                                    resistance level.

              Figure 13.3: Support and Resistance Levels


                       Resistance




                                                     Support



                                                                                                                                                          Unit 13

                                    When a stock declines to its support level, the low price attracts buyers, whose buying
                                    supports the price and keeps it from declining farther. When a stock increases to its resistance
                                    level, the high price attracts sellers, whose selling hinders a further price rise. Stocks may
                                    fluctuate in trading ranges for months, testing their support and resistance levels. If a
                                    particular stock’s price penetrates either the support or the resistance level, the change is
                                    considered significant.

                                    A decline through the support level is called a bearish breakout; a rise through the resistance
                                    level is called a bullish breakout. Breakouts usually signal the beginning of a new upward or
                                    downward trend.


                                    Advances/Declines
                                    The number of issues closing up or down on a specific day reflects market breadth. The
                                    number of advances and declines can be a significant indication of the market’s relative
                                    strength. When declines outnumber advances by a large amount, the market is bearish even
                                    if it closed higher. In bull markets, advances substantially outnumber declines. Technical
                                    analysts plot daily advances and declines on a graph to produce an advance/decline line that
                                    gives them an indication of market breadth trends.

                                           Charting Stocks
                                           In addition to studying the overall market, technical analysts attempt to identify patterns in
                                           the prices of individual stocks.


                                           Trendlines
                                           Although a stock’s price may spike up or down daily, over time its price tends to move in one
                                           direction. Technical analysts identify patterns in the trendlines of individual stocks from
                                           graphs as they do patterns in the overall market. They base their buy or sell recommendations
                                           on a stock’s price trendline. An upward trendline is bullish; a downward one is bearish.

                                           A trendline connects the lows in an uptrend and the highs in a downtrend. Three common
                                           patterns in stock price trendlines are consolidations, reversals, and support and resistance
                                           levels.


                                           Consolidations
                                           If a stock’s price stays within a narrow range, it is said to be consolidating. When viewed on a
                                           graph, the trendline is horizontal and moves sideways, neither up nor down.


                                           Reversals
                                           A reversal indicates that an upward or a downward trendline has halted, and the stock’s price
                                           is moving in the opposite direction. Between the two trendlines, a period of consolidation
                                           occurs, and the stock price levels off. A genuine reversal pattern can be difficult to recognize
                                           because trends are composed of many rises and declines, which may occur at different rates
                                           and for different lengths of time.

                                           Because of its gently curving shape, an easily identifiable reversal pattern is called a saucer
                                           (reversal of a downtrend) or an inverted saucer (reversal of an uptrend). A similar reversal
                                           pattern is the head-and-shoulders pattern, named for its resemblance to the human body.

                                           The head-and-shoulders top pattern indicates the beginning of a bearish trend in the stock.
                                           First, the stock price rises, then it reaches a plateau at the neckline (left shoulder). A second
                                           advance pushes the price higher, but then the price falls back to the neckline (head). Finally,

                                      the stock price rises again, but falls back to the neckline (right shoulder) and continues
                                      downward, indicating a reversal of the upward trend.

                                      When reversed, this pattern is called a head-and-shoulders bottom, or an inverted head-
                                      and-shoulders, and indicates a bullish reversal.

                                      Overbought and Oversold
                                      If market indexes such as the S&P 500 and the Dow are declining, but the number of
                                      declining stocks relative to the number of advancing stocks is falling (fewer stocks declining),

                                                                                                                                                             Unit 13
                                      the market is said to be oversold and is likely to reverse itself. This is considered to be a bullish
                                      sign.

                                      Conversely, if market indexes are rising, but the number of declining stocks relative to the
                                      number of advancing stocks is rising (fewer stocks rising), the market is said to be overbought
                                      and is ready for a correction. This is considered to be a bearish sign.


                                      Technical Market Theories
                                      Technical analysts follow various theories regarding market trends. Some of them are outlined
                                      next.


                                      Dow Theory
                                      Analysts use the Dow theory to confirm the end of a major market trend. According to the
                                      theory, the three types of changes in stock prices are primary trends (one year or more),
                                      secondary trends (3–12 weeks), and short-term fluctuations (hours or days).

                                      In a bull market, the primary trend is upward. However, stock prices may still drop in a
                                      secondary trend within the primary upward trend, even for as long as 12 weeks. The trough
                                      of the downward secondary trend should be higher than the trough of the previous downward
                                      trend. In a bear market, secondary upward trends may occur, but the highs reached during
                                      those secondary upward movements are successively lower.

                                      According to the Dow theory, the primary trend in a bull market is a series of higher highs
                                      and higher lows. In a bear market, the primary trend is a series of lower highs and lower lows.
                                      Daily fluctuations are considered irrelevant.

                                         A primary upward trend interrupted by secondary downward movements is shown in the
                                         following chart. The chart illustrates a series of successively higher highs and lows, conforming
                                         to the definition of a primary upward trend.

                                         Any change in direction is considered deceptive unless the Dow Jones Industrial and
                                         Transportation Averages reflect the change. However, using this average lacks precision and is
                                         sometimes slow in confirming changes in market trends.

                                         Odd-Lot Theory
                                         Typically, small investors engage in odd-lot trading. Followers of the odd-lot theory believe
                                         that these small investors invariably buy and sell at the wrong times. When odd-lot traders
                                         buy, odd-lot analysts are bearish. When odd-lot traders sell, odd-lot analysts are bullish.

                                         This theory goes way back in time. Think of the 1930s when a house might have cost $4,000.
                                         People took out mortgages for that kind of money. If a stock is priced at $40, and a round lot
                                         of that stock cost $4,000, most people didn’t have that kind of money. So they bought one
                                         or two shares because that is what they could afford. They were not necessarily well-informed
                                         investors and often traded on emotion—buying when they should have sold, and selling when
                                         they should have bought.

                                                      TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                      The standard trading unit for equity securities is a round lot. A round lot is 100 shares.
                                                      An odd-lot is something less than 100 shares. If a trade is made for 550 shares of
                                                      common stock, the trade was for five round lots (500 shares) and one odd-lot (50
                                                      shares).


                                         Short-Interest Theory
                                         Short interest refers to the number of shares that have been sold short. Because short
                                         positions must be repurchased eventually, most analysts believe that short interest reflects
                                         mandatory demand, which creates a support level for stock prices. High short interest is a
                                         bullish indicator, and low short interest is a bearish indicator.

              LESSON 13.4: ANALYZING MUNICIPAL SECURITIES
                                       LO 13.f Identify the specific market analysis considerations for municipal
                                       securities.



                                       Introduction
                                       A number of publications and services offer information on proposed new issues and
                                       secondary market activity for municipal issues. These include The Bond Buyer and Thomson
                                       Muni News, which publishes the Thomson Muni Market Monitor (formerly known as
                                       Munifacts). These are used to analyze the current market for municipal securities. Here are the
                                       most testable items.


                                       The Bond Buyer
                                       The Bond Buyer is published every business day and serves as an authoritative source of
                                       information on primary market municipal bonds. The Bond Buyer publishes the 30-day
                                       visible supply (the total dollar volume of municipal offerings—not including short-term
                                       notes—expected to reach the market in the next 30 days) and the placement, or acceptance,
                                       ratio indexes (the percentage of the total dollar value of new issues sold versus the total dollar
                                       value of new issues offered for sale the prior week). Although not a term you’ll see on the
                                       exam, think of this as the success ratio. It reports how well the underwriters did in moving the
                                       week’s new issues.

                                                   TAKE NOTE                                                                                                    Unit 13
                                                   If the visible supply is exceptionally large, interest rates are likely to rise to attract
                                                   investors to the larger number of bonds available. A small visible supply is an
                                                   indication that interest rates are likely to fall.
                                                   If the placement ratio is high, the market for municipal bonds is strong. If it is low,
                                                   dealers will likely exhibit concern about bidding on new issues. A placement ratio of
                                                   90% means that market has absorbed 90% of the dollar volume of bonds issued for
                                                   the week, with 10% left in the dealer’s inventory.
                                       The Bond Buyer also compiles the 40 Bond Index, 20 Bond Index, 11 Bond Index, and the
                                       Revdex 25.

                                                            TAKE NOTE
                                                            The yields on the Revdex are always higher than the yields on the GO 20 Bond Index
                                                            because revenue bonds have higher risk. The yields on the 11 Bond Index are lower
                                                            than the yields on the 20 Bond Index because the 11 Bond Index contains the more
                                                            highly rated bonds.

                                    EXAMPLE
                                    Examine the Kenton County, Kentucky, Airport bond. The name of the bond appears
                                    in the left column under the Issue column. The entries in the Coupon and Maturity
                                    columns indicate that the bond pays 6.3% interest and matures on March 1, 2025. The
                                    bond was traded at 95¼, or $952.50, per $1,000 bond.
                                    The price represents a half-point ($5) decrease from the last trade, as reported under
                                    the Chg (change) column. The 6.71 yield is the bid yield and the YTM. Because the
                                    bond is selling at a discount, the YTM is higher than the CY.


              LESSON 13.5: INVESTMENT COSTS, FEES, AND TAX CONSIDERATIONS

                         LO 13.g Analyze the importance of costs and fees when selecting investments.



                         Introduction
                         In addition to all of the analytical tools presented in the unit, the registered representative
                         must be cognizant of the costs involved in selecting a security or portfolio of securities.
                         Furthermore, there are a number of tax considerations that come into play.


                         Costs and Fees Associated With Investments
                         Many of costs and fees associated with investments have already been covered. Examples

                                                                                                                                                Unit 13
                         include markups, markdowns, and commissions. We have also covered the different mutual
                         fund share classes and how their charges work. Another charge for mutual funds is the 12b-1
                         asset-based charge. Variable annuities usually carry surrender charges. Some clients open up
                         fee-based accounts where, for a flat fee, trading is commission-free. Following are some costs
                         we haven’t dealt with yet.


                         Mortality and Expense Charges
                         An important consideration in determining the appropriate variable insurance product
                         (annuity or life), is the company’s mortality and expense charges. Just as mutual funds
                         have an expense ratio where all of the operating costs are viewed as a percentage of the net
                         assets, variable insurance companies have expense ratios, too. Some of these charges, such
                         as for portfolio management, are similar to those found with mutual funds. But, insurance
                         companies have some specific costs unique to their products.

                         The most significant of those is the mortality expense. Because this is not an actuarial science
                         exam, we’ll keep it very simple. Annuities and life insurance have certain guarantees. In the
                         case of the annuity, once annuitization begins, the insurance company guarantees payments
                         for life. In the case of life insurance, it guarantees a death benefit. In both cases, mortality
                         tables are used to compute life expectancy.

                         For example, if life expectancy changes and annuitants live longer than originally anticipated,
                         the insurance companies assume the increased mortality cost. Or, if life expectancy moves the
                         other way and people don’t live as long as expected, life insurance premiums will be too low.
                         The mortality expense is a charge collected by the insurance companies as a form of insurance
                         protecting them against mortality risk.

           366         Unit 13   Portfolio or Account Analysis and Its Application to Security Selection



                                                      TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                      The mortality risk fee covers the risk that the insured may live for a period shorter (life
                                                      insurance) or longer (annuity) than assumed. The expense risk fee covers the risk that
                                                      the costs of administering and issuing the policy may be greater than assumed. And, of
                                                      course, the investment management fee is the cost of the management of the chosen
                                                      separate account subaccounts.


                                         Death Benefit Fee
                                         Most variable annuities offer an option stating that if the investor dies during the
                                         accumulation period, the beneficiary will receive the greater of the current value of the
                                         account or the amount invested. Therefore, the estate is assured of getting back at least
                                         the original investment. There is a cost for this benefit which is usually sold as a rider to
                                         the policy. Regardless of whether this option is chosen, annuities, like all other insurance
                                         products, provide for a designation of beneficiary. One important benefit of a named
                                         beneficiary is that probate is avoided.


                                         Waiver of Premium
                                         A popular option available for insurance policies is the waiver of premium. If the insured
                                         becomes disabled or otherwise unable to work, the premiums are waived.


                                         The 5% Markup Policy (FINRA Rule 2121)
                                         The 5% markup policy was adopted to ensure that the investing public receives fair treatment
                                         and pays reasonable rates for brokerage services in both exchange and OTC markets. It
                                         is considered a guideline only and is not a firm rule for markups and markdowns. A firm
                                         charging a customer more or less than a 5% markup may or may not be in violation of fair
                                         and equitable trade practices. The markup may be considered excessive once all the relevant
                                         factors are taken into account.

                                         A broker-dealer can fill a customer order in the following three ways:
                                          If the broker-dealer is a market maker in the security, it will (as principal) buy from or sell
                                           to the customer, charging a markup or markdown.
                                          If the firm is not a market maker in the security, it can fill the order as agent, without
                                           taking a position in the security, and charge a commission for its execution services.
                                          An order can be filled as a riskless and simultaneous transaction.


                                         Markup Based on Representative Market Prices
                                         The 5% markup or markdown is based on the price representative of prevailing (inside)
                                         market prices at the time of a customer transaction. The 5% markup policy applies to all
                                         transactions in nonexempt listed or unlisted securities traded on an exchange or OTC,
                                         regardless of whether the transactions are executed as agency or principal trades.

                                  EXAMPLE
                                              Bid       Ask/Offer
                                    MMA      17.50        17.95
                                    MMB      17.58        17.99
                                    MMC      17.62        18.01
                                  This inside quote is 17.62 – 17.95. That is, the highest any market maker is willing to
                                  pay (bid) for the stock is 17.62 and the lowest any market maker is willing to sell the
                                  stock (ask/offer) is 17.95. Using the inside quotes always gives us the narrowest spread.
                                  It is from these inside quotes that a dealer’s markup or markdown is computed for
                                  compliance with the 5% policy.

                                  TAKE NOTE
                                  The 5% policy applies to markups, markdowns, and commissions.


                       Fixed Public Offering Price Securities
                       The 5% markup policy does not apply to mutual funds, variable annuity contracts, or
                       securities sold in public offerings, all of which are sold by a prospectus, nor does it apply to
                       municipal securities.


                       Dealer’s Inventory Costs
                       If a customer’s buy order is filled from a broker-dealer’s inventory, the net price to the
                                                                                                                                              Unit 13
                       customer is based on the prevailing inside market (highest bid and lowest ask), regardless of
                       whether the BD selling to the customer is also making a market in the stock and what the
                       firm’s quote might be.

                       The price at which the broker-dealer acquired the stock being sold to the customer has no
                       bearing on the net price to the customer; the price to the customer must be reasonably related
                       to the current market.


                       Riskless and Simultaneous Transactions
                       A riskless and simultaneous transaction is an order to buy or sell stock in which the firm
                       receiving the order is not a market maker. The dealer has the following two options for filling
                       the order:
                        As agent for the customer, it could buy or sell on the customer’s behalf and charge a
                         commission, subject to the 5% policy.
                        It could buy or sell for its riskless principal account, then buy or sell to the customer as
                         principal, charging a markup or markdown subject to the 5% policy.

                       When the order is filled as a principal transaction, the BD must disclose the markup to the
                       customer.

                                         Proceeds Transactions
                                         When a customer sells securities and uses the proceeds to purchase other securities in a
                                         proceeds transaction, the BD’s combined commissions and markups must be consistent with
                                         the 5% markup policy. In other words, member firms must treat proceeds transactions as one
                                         transaction for markup and markdown purposes.

                                                      EXAMPLE
                                                      A member firm acting as agent sells 100 shares of stock for a customer and charges a
                                                      commission of $87.50. The customer directs that the proceeds of the sale be invested
                                                      in 100 shares of WXYZ, which the member sells to the customer at 21 net. At the time
                                                      of sale, the inside market for WXYZ was 20 − 20.25. Under FINRA rules, the percent
                                                      markup for this proceeds transaction is
                                                      A. 4.32%.
                                                      B. 7.16%.
                                                      C. 8.02%.
                                                      D. 9.37%.

                                                      The answer is 8.02%. In a proceeds transaction, markup is computed by combining
                                                      the amounts earned on both the sell side and buy side and applying the total against
                                                      the inside market on the buy side. $87.50 (sell side) + $75.00 (21 buy price – 20.25
                                                      inside ask = $75 markup) = $162.50. Divide the total by the inside market on the buy
                                                      side (20.25/share or $2,025) and the percentage markup is 8.02%.


                                         Markup Policy Considerations
                                         While the policy is applicable to all account types, in assessing the fairness of a
                                         BD’s commission and markup practices, the following factors are considered:


                                         Type of Security
                                         In general, more market risk is associated with making markets and trading common stocks
                                         than is associated with dealing in bonds. The policy gives guidance to markups specific to
                                         both stock and bond transactions, including government securities. The more risk a BD
                                         assumes, the greater the justification for higher markups.


                                         Inactively Traded Stocks
                                         The thinner the market for a security, the more volatile the stock and the greater the market
                                         risk to anyone dealing in the stock. Thus, a BD is justified in charging higher markups on
                                         inactively traded stocks. For inactive stocks and situations where no prevailing market quotes
                                         are available, a BD may base a markup on its cost in the stock.


                                         Selling Price of Security
                                         Commission and markup rates should decrease as a stock’s price increases.


                                         Dollar Amount of Transaction
                                         Transactions of relatively small dollar amounts generally warrant higher percentage markups
                                         than large-dollar transactions.

                       Nature of the BD’s Business
                       This standard pertains to full-service brokers versus discount brokers. In most cases, a general
                       securities firm has higher operating costs than does a discount broker and thus may justify
                       higher commissions and markups.


                       Pattern of Markups
                       Although the regulators are concerned primarily with detecting cases where BDs have
                       established patterns of excessive markups, a single incident could still be considered an unfair
                       markup.

                                 TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                 The 5% markup policy is peculiarly named for two reasons:
                                 1.	It applies to markups, markdowns, and commissions, meaning it is applicable to
                                     principal and agency transactions.
                                 2.	Five percent is not the limit. A transaction charge of more than 5% might be fine if
                                     it is reasonably based on the circumstances of the trade.
                       Examples of subject transactions are REITS, closed-end company shares, ADRs, third-market
                       trades, listed and unlisted stocks, bonds, and government securities.

                       New issues sold by prospectus and municipal securities are not subject to this policy.

                       Remember that all computations must be based on the inside quote (the best available from

                                                                                                                                             Unit 13
                       all the market makers), not the firm’s quote.


                       Net Transactions
                       A net transactions is sometimes called a hidden fee. When a broker-dealer sells to a client on
                       a net basis, it means there is no commission charge. This occurs when the member acts as a
                       principal in the trade. Does that mean the broker-dealer isn’t making anything? FINRA wants
                       to be sure that clients understand that in a net trade, there is either a markup or a markdown.
                       It is against the conduct rules for a member to misrepresent the costs in a net trade.

                       Introduction
                       Tax planning is an essential component of investment planning. This is especially true for
                       those in the higher income tax brackets, but it also impacts investors at all tax levels. As we
                       end this unit, we will go into depth on some of the tax issues that may appear on your exam.


                       Wash Sales
                       No, we’re not talking about a special at your local laundromat. As we learned earlier in
                       the course, if an investor has net capital losses, up to $3,000 of that loss can be taken as a
                       deduction against ordinary income. The wash sale rule of the IRS applies to investors who
                       take a loss on the sale of a security and repurchase that same security within a specific time.

                                         Capital losses may not be used to offset gains or income if the investor sells a security at a loss
                                         and purchases the same or a substantially identical security within 30 days before or after the
                                         trade date. The sale at a loss and the repurchase within this period is a wash sale.

                                         The rule disallows the loss or tax benefit from selling a security and repurchasing the security
                                         or one substantially identical to it in this manner. The term substantially identical refers to any
                                         other security with the same investment performance likelihood as the one being sold.

                                         Examples are
                                          securities convertible into the one being sold,
                                          warrants to purchase the security being sold,
                                          rights to purchase the security being sold, and
                                          call options to purchase the security being sold.

                                          31st                           SELL                              31st

                                          DAY                             @                                DAY

                                           OK          30 Days          LOSS          30 Days              OK



                                                      TAKE NOTE
                                                      The wash sale rule covers 30 days before and after the trade date. Including the trade
                                                      date, this is a total period of 61 days.

                                                      EXAMPLE
                                                      An investor buys 100 shares of ABC for $50 per share. One year later, the investor
                                                      sells those shares for $40 per share. Fifteen days after the sale, 100 shares of ABC are
                                                      repurchased for $42 per share. The investor’s new cost basis is $52 because the $10
                                                      loss that was disallowed is added to the repurchase price of $42.

                                                      TAKE NOTE
                                                      The wash sale rule applies only to realized losses—not to realized gains.

                                                      TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                      The interpretation of the wash sale rule does not consider different options series to
                                                      be substantially identical securities. For example, an options investor who is long an
                                                      XYZ OCT 40 call sells the contract at a loss. Immediately after the sale, the investor
                                                      purchases an XYZ NOV 40 call. The IRS does not consider this a wash sale and,
                                                      therefore, the loss is deductible.


                                         Tax Swapping
                                         A tax swap is the sale of a bond and the simultaneous purchase of a different bond in a like
                                         amount. The technique is used to control tax liability, extend maturity, or update investment
                                         objectives. This is often confused with a wash sale. When done properly, the loss is not
                                         disallowed.

                                         The IRS compares three qualities of debt securities in determining whether they are
                                         substantially identical: the maturity, coupon, and issuer. A bond is substantially identical if all
                                         three qualities of the bond sold at a loss and the newly purchased bond are the same.

                       After selling a bond, an investor can buy another bond with a different maturity, coupon, or
                       issuer without violating the wash sale rule.

                                  EXAMPLE
                                  An investor could sell an ABC 8% bond that matures in 2030 at a loss and buy back an
                                  XYZ 8% bond that matures in 2031 and claim the loss. Even though the coupons are
                                  the same, the issuers and maturity dates are different. This is commonly called tax
                                  swapping.


                       Determining Which Shares to Sell
                       An investor holding identical securities, each with a different acquisition date and cost basis,
                       may determine which shares to sell by electing one of three accounting methods: FIFO,
                       share identification, or average cost basis. If the investor fails to choose, the IRS assumes the
                       investor liquidates shares on a FIFO basis.

                       When FIFO shares are sold, the cost of the shares held the longest is used to calculate the gain
                       or loss. In a rising market, this method normally creates adverse tax consequences.

                       When using the share identification accounting method, the investor keeps track of the cost
                       of each share purchased and uses this information to liquidate the shares that would provide
                       the lowest capital gain. Share identification is used to identify the specific per-share cost basis
                       when shares are sold. The investor keeps track of the cost of each share purchased and specifies
                       which shares to sell on the basis of that investor’s specific tax needs.


                                                                                                                                               Unit 13
                       A shareholder may elect to use an average cost basis when redeeming mutual fund shares (but
                       not shares of specific stocks). The investor would calculate average basis by dividing the total
                       cost of all shares owned by the total number of shares. The shareholder may not change the
                       decision to use the average basis method without IRS permission.

                                  TAKE NOTE
                                  Share identification may result in more advantageous tax treatment, but most
                                  accountants prefer the convenience of the averaging method for mutual fund shares.
                                  Share identification is most commonly used with stock sales.

                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                  5.   On April 10, 2019, when DEF stock was trading at 31, Sara Park purchased 10 DEF OCT
                                       30 puts at a premium of 3 points each. By September 12, the stock had dropped to
                                       27 and Park bought 5 more OCT 30 puts at a premium of 4½ each. On October 2, Park
                                       closed out 5 of her 15 contracts at a price of 7 each. Using IRS assumptions, she
                                         A. realized a short-term capital gain of $2,000.
                                        B. realized a short-term capital gain of $750.
                                        C. made $2,000 in ordinary income.
                                        D. realized a $1,250 short-term capital gain.
                                       Answer: A. The IRS assumes FIFO, so Park was selling 5 of the initial purchase made
                                       at a price of $300 each. The sale at $700 realized a short-term capital gain of $400
                                       per contract for a total of $2,000. She could have used the identified cost basis and
                                       selected the 5 puts from the second purchase. In that case, the gain would have been
                                       $250 per contract (7 – 4½), or a total of $1,250. Although this example uses options, it
                                       would be the same for any other security.

                                         Cost Basis of Shares Inherited/Gifted
                                         The cost basis of inherited property is either stepped up or stepped down to its fair
                                         market value (FMV) at the date of the decedent’s death. In the case of open-end investment
                                         companies, this would be the NAV. Shares inherited are always considered to have a holding
                                         period that is long-term for tax purposes. Therefore, the sale of inherited shares are subject to
                                         more favorable long-term tax rates, no matter how long (or short) they have been held by the
                                         beneficiary.

                                         When a gift of securities is made, the donor’s cost basis becomes the donee’s cost basis.

                                                      EXAMPLE
                                                      Grandpa bought $10,000 of stock 20 years ago; it is currently valued at $50,000.
                                                      If inherited, the cost basis of shares received equals the FMV at Grandpa’s death:
                                                      $50,000.
                                                      If Grandpa instead gave it to Susie, who received the stock as a gift, the cost basis
                                                      remains unchanged at $10,000 and his holding period continues.

                                                      TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                      The step up provision does not apply when inheriting an annuity.

                                                      PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                      6.    A client purchases 1,000 shares of the ABC Global Growth Fund when the NAV is $8.75
                                                            and the POP is $9.21. Three years later, the client makes a gift to her daughter when
                                                            NAV is $9.50 and POP is $10.00, and the daughter elects to receive all distributions in
                                                            cash. Two years later, she sells all shares when the NAV is $14.25 and POP is $15.00.
                                                            What are the tax consequences of this sale?
                                                             A. Long-term capital gain of $5,040
                                                             B. Long-term capital gain of $4,750
                                                             C. Long-term capital gain of $5,000
                                                             D. Long-term capital gain of $5,500
                                                            Answer: A. In the case of a gift of securities, the donee acquires the donor’s cost
                                                            basis—$9.21 per share. Sale (redemption) takes place at the NAV ($14.25) for a profit
                                                            of $5.04 per share (times 1,000 shares).


                                         Estate and Gift Taxes
                                         Taxes can be levied upon the estate of a deceased person and upon those gifting securities to
                                         others. This section discusses these specific scenarios.


                                         Donor Taxes
                                         When a person dies, tax is due on the estate. This tax is payable by the estate, not by heirs
                                         who inherit the estate (although certain other taxes may apply to heirs). Likewise, if a person
                                         gives a gift, tax is due on the gift. Gift tax is payable by the donor, not the recipient. Estate
                                         and gift taxes are progressive taxes. For tax purposes, the valuation of the estate is the date of
                                         death; the valuation of a gift is the date it is given.

                      Annual Gift Tax Exclusion
                      Individuals may give gifts up to $16,000 per year to any number of individuals without
                      incurring gift tax. The amount of the exclusion is subject to change depending on inflation.
                      Gifts between spouses, no matter the size, are not subject to tax. If a gift tax is due, it is paid
                      by the donor. Payments for a family member’s education or health care expenses are exempt
                      from the gift tax.


                      Estate Tax Exclusion
                      The estate of a deceased person is allowed to exclude some of that person’s estate from
                      taxation. The amount of the exclusion is subject to change depending on current tax law.

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 Estate and gift taxes are progressive taxes that increase with the size of the estate or
                                 the gift. Income taxes are another example of a progressive tax. Flat taxes, such as
                                 sales tax, are considered regressive taxes because they impact lower-income families
                                 and individuals to a greater degree.


                      Unlimited Marital Deduction
                      Married couples are allowed to transfer their entire estate to the surviving spouse at death.
                      This unlimited marital deduction results in taxes being owed at the death of the survivor.



                                                                                                                                         Unit 13
                      Unified Credit
                      Taxation of estates and gifts are unified. That means that whatever is used of the lifetime gift
                      exclusion before death reduces the estate tax exclusion. Both have a lifetime exclusion (2022)
                      of $12.06 million and both have a progressive structure with rates beginning at 18% and
                      reaching a maximum tax rate (2022) of 40%. There are two testable differences:
                      1. The annual gift tax exclusion ($16,000 in 2022).
                      2. Gift taxes are due at the same time as the individual tax return (April 15) while estate
                         taxes are due nine months after death.

                                 TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                 The concept of taxation relating to gifts and inheritances can be confusing. There
                                 are two separate taxable situations; taxes due on the proceeds of a sale of gifted or
                                 inherited property; and taxes due based on the amount of the gift or the estate.
                                 The following should help:
                                 1.) A client has received a gift of securities from someone, or has inherited securities.
                                    a. Gift: The client’s cost basis for determining if there is a taxable capital gain is
                                       that of the donor. The client is considered to have acquired the security on the
                                       donor’s purchase date and at the donor’s purchase price.
                                    b. Inheritance: The client’s cost basis for determining if there is a taxable capital
                                       gain is the FMV as of the date of death. Holding period is not a consideration
                                       because any gains are considered long-term.

                                                     2.) Your client made a gift of securities to someone, or has died.
                                                          a. Gift: The obligation to pay a gift tax is that of the donor. Anything over the annual
                                                             exclusion (currently $16,000) may be subject to the gift tax. The amount of the
                                                             gift for tax purposes is the FMV as of the date of the gift.
                                                          b. Estate: The obligation to pay an estate tax is that of the deceased’s estate. The
                                                             value used to determine if there is an estate tax liability is the FMV.

                                                     PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                     7.    One of your ultra-high net worth clients would like to give some low cost basis stock
                                                           as gifts to her adult grandchildren. It would be prudent for you to tell her that
                                                            A. she should use a TOD account to avoid probate.
                                                            B. for purposes of the gift tax, her cost basis will be used.
                                                            C. unlike an inheritance, there is no stepped-up cost basis.
                                                            D. making the gift under the Uniform Transfer to Minors Act (UTMA) is generally
                                                                  the most advantageous for the child.
                                                           Answer: C. One of the benefits of inheriting low cost basis securities is the stepped-
                                                           up basis, and that does not apply to gifts. Although the donor will not be the one
                                                           subject to capital gains tax, letting her know that the donees (her grandchildren) will
                                                           be receiving the stock at her cost basis would be the right thing to do. TOD would
                                                           not apply to stock that is the subject of a gift; it is only when the stock remains in
                                                           the grandmother’s name and has been designated for the grandchildren after her
                                                           death. When computing the value of a gift to determine if there is a gift tax obligation,
                                                           it is the FMV of the gift that is used. Finally, the question states these are adult

                                        There is a special tax break available to C corporations. When a C corporation owns stock in
                                        another corporation, 50% of the dividends received from that other corporation are excluded
                                        from the corporation’s income. That is, if ABC Corporation receives $10,000 in dividends on
                                        stock it owns in XYZ Corporation, only $5,000 of that dividend is included in ABC’s taxable
                                        income. As a result, if you have clients who own or are investing on behalf of a C corporation,
                                        investing in dividend-paying stocks carries a special bonus.

              INTRODUCTION
                         The concepts discussed in this unit are types of risk that both businesses and investors bear.
                         Though not a comprehensive list, they are among the most common.

                         Although we routinely use the term risk, we often have difficulty defining it precisely. In finance,
                         risk is defined as the uncertainty that an investment will earn its expected rate of return. There
                         are two basic categories of risk: systematic and unsystematic. We will address both of them and
                         their subcategories one at a time.

                         After that, we will look into some customer-specific risks, such as exploitation of seniors and
                         the possible conflicts of interest resulting from an investment adviser receiving soft dollar
                         compensation from a broker-dealer based on the commission business generated by the adviser’s
                         clients.

           LESSON 14.1: TYPES OF RISK
                                         LO 14.a Contrast systematic and nonsystematic risks.



                                         Systematic Risk
                                         Systematic risk is the risk in the return of an investment that is associated with the
                                         macroeconomic factors that affect all risky assets. Stated another way, systematic risk is the
                                         risk that changes in the overall economy will have an adverse effect on individual securities
                                         regardless of the company’s circumstances. It is generally caused by factors that affect all
                                         businesses, such as war, global security threats, or inflation. Primary examples would include
                                         market risk, interest rate risk, and purchasing power risk, each of which will be dealt with
                                         separately. You might also see this referred to as nondiversifiable risk because, as we’ll learn,
                                         systematic risk cannot be avoided through diversification.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     Systemic risk is not a synonym for systematic risk. It has a totally different meaning and
                                                     is not relevant to the exam.


                                         Market Risk
                                         The first example of systematic risk that generally comes to mind is market risk. When the
                                         market tanks, virtually all securities lose value. This is a classic example of a nondiversifiable
                                         risk because, regardless of the number of different stocks in your portfolio, when you
                                         encounter a stock market such as the one we had from late 2007 until early 2009, chances are
                                         most of those assets will have declined in price. In the previous unit, we discussed correlation.
                                         One way to protect against market risk is to have some negatively correlated securities in your
                                         portfolio. Remember, they go up when the others go down.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     Market risk is measured by a security’s beta.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     Should a war break out between two major oil-producing countries, the stock market
                                                     could decline dramatically. The stocks of individual companies would likely decline as
                                                     well, regardless of whether the war directly affected their businesses.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     Market risk cannot be diversified away. As we discussed in Unit 10, options can be
                                                     used to hedge against market risk.


                                         Interest Rate Risk
                                         Interest rates fluctuate in the market all the time. If market conditions or the Federal Reserve
                                         push interest rates higher, the market price of all bonds will be affected. When interest rates
                                         rise, the market price of bonds falls and that is why this is a systematic risk. This risk is
                                         sometimes referred to as the market risk for bonds. Rising interest rates can be bearish for
                                         some common stock prices as well, particularly those of highly leveraged companies such




Series_7_2E.indb 376                                                                                                                         11/19/2021 7:54:15 PM
                                                                           Unit 14   Types of Risk and Required Disclosures     377


                       as public utilities. Having a diversified portfolio of bonds won’t help because an increase in
                       interest rates will cause all bonds to decline in price.

                                  TAKE NOTE
                                  Interest rate risk is intrinsic to all types of fixed-income investments, such as debt
                                  securities and preferred stock, whether from an emerging market issuer or a triple-A
                                  issuer. It is the risk that a security’s value will decline because of an increase in market
                                  interest rates.

                                  EXAMPLE
                                  If the Federal Reserve increases interest rates dramatically, the market price of all
                                  bonds, regardless of credit quality, will decline.

                                  TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                  There are even some common stock investments with interest rate risk. For exam
                                  purposes, it is the common shares of public utility companies. There are two reason
                                  for those stocks being interest-rate sensitive:
                                     Public utility stocks are known for their liberal dividend policies. When a stock’s
                                      price is largely determined by its dividend yield (the case with most utilities), as
                                      interest rates go up, their stock prices go down. This is true of public utility stocks
                                      more than any other common stock.
                                     Public utility companies are highly leveraged. That is, they are regularly borrowing
                                      money. As interest rates go up, so does the utility’s borrowing cost. That will have
                                      the effect of lowering the income and possibly a reduction to the dividend.


                       Method of Reducing Interest Rate Risk
                       A popular way of reducing interest rate risk is by laddering a bond or CD portfolio. Picture
                       a ladder. You see rungs at set intervals going from bottom to top. That is the concept behind
                       a laddered portfolio. In a laddered strategy, the bonds are all purchased at the same time but
                       mature at different times (like the steps on the ladder). As the shorter maturities come due,
                       they are reinvested and now become the long-term ones. This has also been a very common
                       strategy with those purchasing CDs at their local bank.

                                                                                                                                          Unit 14
                       Reinvestment Risk
                       A variation of interest rate risk is reinvestment risk. There is reinvestment risk as to interest
                       and reinvestment risk as to principal.

                       An investor receiving a periodic cash flow from an investment—such as interest on a debt
                       security—may be unable to reinvest the income at the same rate as the security itself is paying.
                       For example, if an investor purchased a bond with a 10% coupon and several years later
                       comparable securities were only paying 7%, the investor would not be able to compound the
                       investment at the original rate. Zero coupon bonds avoid this risk because there is nothing to
                       reinvest.

                       This risk also occurs at maturity. If the fixed-income investor was enjoying a 10% return on
                       the earlier bond, when it matured, the investor was only able to reinvest the principal in a 7%
                       security. That is one of the advantages of purchasing bonds with a longer term to maturity—
                       you’re assured the fixed return for that length.

                                         Inflation Risk (Purchasing Power Risk)
                                         Inflation risk is another systematic risk. Inflation reduces the buying power of a dollar (or
                                         whatever currency is used where you live). A modest amount of inflation is inherent in a
                                         healthy, growing economy. Uncontrolled inflation causes uncertainty among individual
                                         investors as well as corporate managers attempting to evaluate potential returns from projects.
                                         TIPS are one investment vehicle designed to protect against inflation risk.

                                         Fixed-income securities are the most vulnerable to this risk; equity securities are historically
                                         the least susceptible. In Lesson 13.1 of this course, we learned that tangible assets—such as
                                         real estate and precious metals like gold—are also good inflation hedges.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     As we stated, purchasing power risk is a systematic risk, meaning that diversifying your
                                                     portfolio is of little or no help. Let’s assume that an individual nearing retirement took
                                                     $1 million and, seeking income with safety, invested $100,000 into each of 10 different
                                                     corporate bonds, all maturing in 20 years. For sure, this diversification does give
                                                     protection against financial risk (if one of the bonds defaults because of bankruptcy
                                                     of the issuer, the other nine should still pay off). However, if the cost of living rises,
                                                     20 years from now, when each of those bonds pays back the $100,000 principal,
                                                     the investor will have $1 million. How much do you think that $1 million purchase
                                                     compared to what it would have 20 years earlier?


                                         Nonsystematic (Unsystematic) Risk
                                         Unlike systematic risk, which is nondiversifiable, nonsystematic risks can be reduced through
                                         diversification. They are risks that are unique to the specific industry or business enterprise
                                         and would include things such as labor union strikes, lawsuits, and product failure. We will
                                         cover the most testable examples next.


                                         Business Risk
                                         Business risk is an operating risk, generally caused by poor management decisions (e.g.,
                                         Edsel, New Coke, or more recently, Blackberry’s former developers failing to pay attention to
                                         the success of the iPhone). At best, earnings are lowered; at worst, the company goes out of
                                         business and common stockholders probably lose their entire investment.


                                         Financial Risk
                                         Often confused with business risk (it is similar), financial risk relates primarily to those
                                         companies that use debt financing (leverage). An inability to meet those debt obligations
                                         could lead to bankruptcy and, once again, total loss for the stockholders. For that reason, this
                                         is sometimes called credit risk or default risk.

                                                     Nonsystematic risk can be minimized through portfolio diversification. For example,
                                                     a client long 1,000 shares of XYZ selling those shares and investing the proceeds into
                                                     an S&P Index fund eliminates (or greatly reduces) business risk (but not market risk).
                                                     In similar fashion, owning a diversified portfolio of bonds, such as is offered in a bond
                                                     fund, offers protection against financial risk.

                                  TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                  Business risk is highest for investors whose portfolios contain stock in only one issuer
                                  or in lower-rated bonds.


                       Regulatory Risk
                       A sudden change in the regulatory climate can have a dramatic effect on the performance or
                       risk of a business and entire business sectors. Overreaching bureaucrats and court judgments
                       that change the rules a business must comply with can devastate individual companies and
                       industries almost overnight. A very common example of this is rulings by the Environmental
                       Protection Agency, which can sometime play havoc with the oil and gas industry.


                       Legislative Risk
                       It is common to lump together regulatory and legislative risk, but there is a difference.
                       Whereas regulatory risk comes from a change to regulations, legislative risk results from a
                       change in the law. And, because there is frequently a political agenda behind legislation, this
                       risk is sometimes referred to as political risk, although most consider political risk to be of its
                       own making. A governmental, state, or federal agency may pass certain regulations, but only a
                       legislature can pass a law. Changes to the tax code are the most obvious legislative risks.


                       Political Risk
                       It might seem like we are splitting hairs here, but each of these, although potentially
                       interrelated, does have a different basis in the source of the risk. In the case of political risk,
                       most attribute this to potential instability in the political underpinnings of the country (think
                       of a coup). This is particularly true in emerging economies, but, as history has shown, political
                       insurrections can occur even in highly developed societies.


                       Sovereign Risk
                       Sovereign risk ratings capture the risk of a country defaulting on its commercial debt
                       obligations. Headlines were made several years ago when the credit rating of the United States
                       was reduced from AAA (at the time of this printing, the United States was back up to AAA).

                                                                                                                                        Unit 14
                       That is an example of the perceived increased sovereign risk that existed at the time. We
                       discussed other examples in Lesson 4.3 when covering sovereign bonds.

                                  EXAMPLE
                                  Investments that could be affected by regulatory changes include “green” industries
                                  (and those that tend to pollute), oil and gas exploration, airlines, and pharmaceutical
                                  manufacturers. The most common regulatory risk comes from governmental agency
                                  attempts to control or influence product prices or the competitive structure of a
                                  particular industry through the passage and enforcement of regulations.

                                  EXAMPLE
                                  An example of legislative risk is how the domestic boat-building business in the United
                                  States was nearly wiped out in the early 1990s after the government instituted a luxury
                                  tax for yacht purchases.

           380         Unit 14   Types of Risk and Required Disclosures



                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     A recent example of political risk was the actions of the Chavez government in
                                                     Venezuela several years ago, where nationalization took place in many industries,
                                                     ranging from cement to supermarkets. Those investors, in what were previously
                                                     privately owned (not government) businesses saw most, if not all, of their investment
                                                     lost.


                                         Liquidity Risk
                                         Liquidity measures the speed or ease of converting an investment into cash without causing
                                         a price disruption. Liquidity risk is the risk that when an investor wishes to dispose of an
                                         investment, no one will be willing to buy it, or that a very large purchase or sale would not be
                                         possible at the current price. Although there is technically a difference, for exam purposes, you
                                         may also refer to this as marketability risk.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     The Treasury bill market is a highly liquid market because investors can sell a Treasury
                                                     bill within seconds at the quoted prices. Real estate investments, however, can take
                                                     months or years to sell if you want to get close to your asking price. The longer it takes
                                                     to convert an investment into cash without having a fire sale, the greater the liquidity
                                                     risk.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     Listed stocks and mutual funds have virtually no liquidity risk. Thinly traded stocks,
                                                     many municipal bonds, and most tangible assets have a greater degree of inability to
                                                     liquidate rapidly at your price.

                                                     PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                     1.   Which of these risks would be reduced the most by diversification?
                                                           A. Business risk
                                                           B. Interest rate risk
                                                           C. Inflation risk
                                                           D. Market risk
                                                          Answer: A. Diversification works best with nonsystematic (unsystematic)
                                                          risks. Business risk, the possibility of losing money when a specific company
                                                          underperforms, is a common case where spreading the risk around (diversifying),
                                                          reduces risk. The other choices are all systematic risk, and diversification is not very
                                                          useful for them.


                                         Currency or Exchange Rate Risk
                                         Purchasers of foreign securities, whether through direct ownership or American depository
                                         receipts (ADRs), face the uncertainty that the value of either the foreign currency or the
                                         domestic currency will fluctuate. For example, as of the date of publication, the Euro (€) is up
                                         over 13% against the U.S. dollar in the past 12 months. As a result, someone who invested
                                         one year ago in the stock of a company domiciled in the eurozone will find that, even if the
                                         stock has remained level or slightly lower on its local market, in terms of dollars, the value has
                                         increased. On the other hand, if your funds are in domestic cash or cash equivalents, you have
                                         little if any exposure to currency or exchange rate risk.

                                     EXAMPLE
                                     On an individual level, the exam may ask you about exchange rates and vacationers.
                                     For example, you take a trip to Country A and purchase a dinner on your credit card for
                                     200 units of the local currency. Then, on the final night of your stay, you go to the same
                                     restaurant, order the same meal and, once again, the bill is for 200 units. When you get
                                     home, you check your credit card statement and see that you were billed $100 for the
                                     first meal and $110 for the second. What happened? The value of the foreign currency
                                     rose against the U.S. dollar from $0.50 ($100/200) to $0.55 ($110/200). Even though no
                                     prices changed in the foreign country, you encountered currency risk.

                                     TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                     You may need to know that the three primary systematic risks are
                                         market,
                                         interest rate, and
                                         inflation or purchasing power.
                                     And, there are five primary unsystematic risks:
                                         Business
                                         Financial
                                         Liquidity

                                         Regulatory

                                     PRACTICE QUESTION
                                     2.   All of the following risks are considered diversifiable except
                                           A. business risk.
                                           B. liquidity risk.
                                           C. purchasing power risk.
                                           D. sovereign risk.
                                          Answer: C. Purchasing power risk, also known as inflation risk, is a systematic risk
                                          and, as such, is one that cannot generally be lessened through diversification.


              LESSON 14.2: DISCLOSURE OF RISKS                                                                                           Unit 14

                          Introduction
                          It was once said at a FINRA conference the “The religion of the SEC is disclosure.” The
                          point being that full disclosure of all material facts and risks is the only way to operate in this
                          business.

                          As with so many of the lessons, where appropriate, material relating to later lessons has been
                          discussed. That certainly is true with risk disclosures. We’ll mention some of those for ease of
                          going back to review.

                                         Risk Disclosures
                                         The first risk disclosure document we discussed was at Lesson 3.5. That was for penny stocks.
                                         If you don’t remember what those requirements are, please take a glance back at that lesson.
                                         At Lesson 8.4, we pointed out the need to disclose the risks in a mutual fund withdrawal
                                         plan. Shortly after that, at Lesson 8.6, we gave you a quote from a risk disclosure statement
                                         regarding a leveraged ETF. Near the end of Lesson 11.4, we listed the disclosure requirements

                                         Control relationships can lead to significant conflicts of interest. A control relationship exists
                                         when a broker-dealer is owned by, is under common ownership with, or owns an entity that
                                         issues securities. It could be thought of as being part of the same family. When it comes to a
                                         recommendation, one would have a natural bias toward that entity. There are no problems
                                         with this relationship as long as it is disclosed.

                                         There are similar types of relationships where a conflict of interest could exist. That could
                                         affect the ability of the member or its representatives to give totally unbiased information. The
                                         best way to avoid these conflicts of interest is to disclose them so that the customer can decide
                                         what to do. Some examples of potential conflicts of interest are
                                          offering a proprietary product, such as a house fund (a mutual fund where the
                                           underwriter or adviser is affiliated with the broker-dealer);
                                          offering a limited partnership offering (DPP) where the sponsor is an affiliate of the bro­
                                           ker-dealer;
                                          program sponsors, such as investment companies or insurance companies, providing
                                           incentives or rewards to agents for selling the sponsors’ products;
                                          a securities professional having a financial interest in any security being recommended;
                                          a broker-dealer going public and placing shares of its own stock into discretionary
                                           accounts; and
                                          a broker-dealer publishing a favorable research report after underwriting the issuer’s stock
                                           offering.

                                         This is just a sample. The key point is, if there is any doubt about the transparency of the
                                         recommendation or transaction, be sure to make full disclosure.

                                                     PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                     3.   A conservative customer is invested in a large-cap, value-managed equity fund. The
                                                          stock market drops 10% because of a poor economic forecast for the country. Your
                                                          customer is upset that his conservative mutual fund lost almost as much as the stock
                                                          market. What risks does your customer need to understand?
                                                            A. The investor should be aware that the size of a mutual fund, if smaller, may
                                                                result in greater losses than mutual funds that have more money to invest.
                                                                This is known as capitalization risk.
                                                            B. The investor should be aware that when the stock market goes down, all
                                                                securities trading will decline proportionately.
                                                            C. The investor should know that mutual funds tend to be diversified, but that
                                                                does not protect the portfolio from systematic risk.
                                                           D. The investor should know that if he wants to liquidate the position, mutual
                                                                funds have liquidity risk.

                                                                        Unit 14   Types of Risk and Required Disclosures     383


                                      Answer: C. Both stocks and bonds involve some degree of market risk—the risk
                                      to investors is they may lose some of their principal because of price volatility in
                                      the overall market (also known as systematic risk). The size of a mutual fund has
                                      no bearing or protection from market risk. Mutual funds are liquid; they can be
                                      turned into cash quickly. Federal law requires redemption at NAV within seven days.
                                      However, that does not mean an investor can’t lose money.


                                  TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                  Suppose you were selling shares of a company where your sister was the CEO. Do you
                                  think you’d have to disclose that potential conflict to your clients? Yes!


                       Regulation Full Disclosure (FD)
                       Regulation Full Disclosure (FD) is an SEC rule dealing with issuers disclosing information
                       that can affect the price of the stock. Before passage of this rule, there was always a risk to the
                       individual investor that an issuer might disclose material nonpublic information (MNPI) to
                       certain institutional investors. Or, perhaps disclosure would be made to analysts at a broker-
                       dealer who was a market maker in the company’s stock. This put the “little guy” at a distinct
                       disadvantage.

                       These disclosures are rarely made intentionally today. That would require an immediate public
                       disclosure of the information. Almost all Regulation FD disclosures are for unintentional
                       leaks. When that happens, the issuer must make prompt disclosure (defined as before the next
                       trading day).

                       The SEC has agreed that public conference calls, press releases or press conferences, and
                       webcasts are FD-compliant methods of public disclosure.


                       Tender Offers
                       It is not uncommon for one company to attempt to takeover another by acquiring a
                       significant percentage of its voting shares. This is called a tender offer. A tender offer may also
                       be made by an issuer of noncallable bonds when interest rates have fallen. Without the call
                       feature, this would be the best way to retire the old high interest-rate bonds.

                       The SEC defines tender offer as “an active and widespread solicitation by a company or third

                                                                                                                                       Unit 14
                       party (often called the bidder or offeror) to purchase a substantial percentage of the company’s
                       securities. Bidders may conduct tender offers to acquire equity (common stock) in a particular
                       company or debt issued by the company.”

                       In general, tender offers for equity securities need shareholder approval. The nature of these
                       offers requires adequate disclosures to clients. Usually, the tender offer is at a premium to the
                       most recent trade so it can be a good deal for the client. There is a time limit and, if the client
                       is not aware of that and misses it, not only will the client be unhappy, but it could lead to an
                       arbitration case against the firm and/or the registered representative.

                       Here are some testable dates:
                        The tender offer, unless withdrawn, under Regulation 14E, must remain open for at least
                         20 business days from the date the offer is first announced.
                        If the terms of the offer are changed, the revised offer must remain open for at least 20
                         business days from the commencement and 10 business days from the date the terms are
                         changed.

           384         Unit 14   Types of Risk and Required Disclosures



                                          The target company, within 10 business days of the announcement, must provide its
                                           share­holders with a statement:
                                              –    accepting or rejecting the offer,
                                              –    expressing no opinion on the offer, or
                                              –    that it is unable to take a position on the offer.

                                         There is one important prohibited action: short-tendering.

                                         Shareholders of the target company are permitted to tender shares only to the extent of their
                                         net long position. That means shareholders cannot sell shares back to the company that they
                                         do not own.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     A customer is long 400 shares of ABCD in a cash account and short 100 shares of the
                                                     stock in a margin account. If ABCD becomes the target of a tender offer, the cus­tomer
                                                     would be permitted to tender 300 shares, the net long position. If the customer were
                                                     permitted to tender the 400 shares in the cash account and the tender offer was
                                                     successful in acquiring all the outstanding shares, the customer would be short 100
                                                     shares with no way to cover.
                                                     A customer is considered long a stock if the customer owns
                                                         the stock,
                                                         a convertible security and has issued conversion instructions, or
                                                         a call option and has issued exercise instructions.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     There is a special rule for a partial tender. If a tender offer is for less than 100% of the
                                                     outstanding shares or is contingent on a minimum number of shares being tendered,
                                                     holders of convertible securities can tender without first converting. They will only be
                                                     required to convert if their tender is accepted.

                                                     PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                     4.   An investor is long 300 shares of ABCD in a cash account and short 300 shares of
                                                          ABCD in a margin account. A tender offer for ABCD is announced. How many shares
                                                          may be tendered by the investor?

                                        Answer: A. Only the investor’s net long position may be tendered. The investor’s
                                        long posi­tion of 300 shares is fully offset by the short position of 300 shares. No
                                        shares can be tendered in this situation.


                         SEC Rule 10b-18
                         SEC Rule 10b-18 appears in the FINRA Content Outline, but we don’t expect any exam
                         questions on it. Just in case there is a surprise, this rule deals with an issuer buying back its
                         own stock in the open market. If an issuer wants to buy back its own securities in the open
                         market, SEC Rule 10b-18 applies. If it is ever tested, these are the most likely candidates:
                          Transactions cannot affect the opening or closing of the security. To be safe, the issuer
                           can’t be involved in the first trade at the opening or do any purchasing in the final 30
                           minutes of the trading day (3:30–4:00 pm ET).
                          Transactions can be executed at prices no higher than the highest independent bid or the
                           last reported sale price, whichever is higher.


                         Margin Risk Disclosure Document
                         When a client opens a margin account, the risk disclosure document covered in Lesson 2.7
                         must be furnished. Because that document is highly testable, we urge you to go back and
                         review it. You might wait until after our coverage of margin math in Unit 16 because some of
                         the concepts may be easier to understand at that point.

                                                                                                                                          Unit 14
                         is taking place in a client’s account.


                         Senior Exploitation
                         Member firms and their associated persons must pay close attention to the accounts of
                         specified adults. They are frequently easy targets for scam artists. Amazingly, a very high
                         percentage of the financial abuse is committed by their own family members. What exactly
                         does FINRA consider financial exploitation? Financial exploitation is considered
                          the wrongful or unauthorized taking, withholding, appropriation, or use of a specified
                           adult’s funds or securities; or
                          any act or omission taken by a person, including through the use of a power of attorney,
                           guardianship, or any other authority, regarding a specified adult to
                             –   obtain control through deception, intimidation, or undue influence, over the
                                 specified adult’s money, assets, or property; or
                             –   convert the specified adult’s money, assets, or property.

                                         Prevention
                                         Here are some suggested steps that member firms might want to take to prevent exploitation
                                         of their senior clients.
                                         1. There should be clear, written procedures specifically addressing the needs of these clients.
                                         2. Personnel should be given a plan showing what to do when exploitation is suspected. That
                                            would include how to escalate the concern.
                                         3. Keep up with the regulations. Although the exam will only deal with the FINRA rules,
                                            the states have similar rules and there is the federal Senior Safe Act.
                                         4. Training and more training. Rule 2165 provides for a safe harbor, but only when the
                                            member can document proper training of personnel. The training should point out the
                                            red flags to look for, such as cognitive decline and unusual activity in the account.
                                         5. Take preemptive action. When a registered representative notices changes, reach out to
                                            the trusted person contact before anything happens.


           LESSON 14.4: EXCHANGE, BROKER-DEALER COMMISSIONS, AND
                        BROKERAGE AND RESEARCH SERVICES
                                         LO 14.d Recall the safe harbor provisions of Section 28(e) of the Exchange Act.



                                         Introduction
                                         Broker-dealers typically provide a bundle of services to investment advisers. These include
                                         research and execution of transactions. The research provided can be either proprietary
                                         (created and provided by the broker-dealer) or third party (created by a third party but
                                         provided by the broker-dealer). Because commission dollars pay for the entire bundle of
                                         services, the practice of allocating certain dollars to pay for the research component is called
                                         soft dollars. The SEC has defined soft dollar practices as arrangements under which products or
                                         services other than execution of securities transactions are obtained by an investment adviser
                                         from or through a broker-dealer in exchange for the direction by the investment adviser of
                                         client brokerage transactions to the broker-dealer.


                                         Safe Harbor
                                         The original use of the term safe harbor had a maritime connotation, in that it referred to
                                         a safe place for a ship to enter, especially during a storm or a war. In the business world, it
                                         has come to mean a method of behavior which avoids running afoul of the law. In our case,
                                         the Section 28(e) safe harbor term describes compensation to an investment adviser from a
                                         broker-dealer that will generally not be considered unethical.

                                         Because of the conflict of interest that exists when an investment adviser receives research,
                                         products, or other services as a result of using the commissions generated by client trades, the
                                         SEC requires advisers to disclose soft dollar arrangements to their clients.

                                         Here is an example of a statement found in one adviser’s brochure:

                                               We may direct transactions for your account to registered broker-dealers in
                                               return for research products and services that assist us in making decisions about
                                               investments. The research products will be used to generally service all of our clients,




Series_7_2E.indb 386                                                                                                                      11/19/2021 7:54:21 PM
                                                                           Unit 14   Types of Risk and Required Disclosures      387


                            so the brokerage commissions you pay may be used to pay for research that is not
                            used in managing your account.

                       Finally, the SEC believes that an adviser accepting soft dollar benefits must explain that
                        the adviser benefits because it does not have to produce or pay for the research or other
                         products or services acquired with soft dollars; and
                        the adviser has an incentive to select or recommend brokers based on the adviser’s interest
                         in receiving these benefits, rather than on the client’s interest in getting the most favorable
                         execution.

                                 TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                 What this all comes down to is knowing what is and what is not included in the
                                 safe harbor provisions. Here are some of the items that, if received as soft dollar
                                 compensation, would likely fall under Section 28(e)’s safe harbor provisions:
                                     Research reports analyzing the performance of a particular company or stock
                                     Financial newsletters and trade journals could be eligible research if they relate
                                      with appropriate specificity
                                     Quantitative analytical software
                                     Seminars or conferences with appropriate content
                                     Effecting and clearing securities trades
                                 On the other hand, likely to fall out of the safe harbor would be the following:
                                     Telephone lines
                                     Office furniture, including computer hardware
                                     Travel expenses associated with attending seminars
                                     Rent
                                     Any software that does not relate directly to analysis of securities
                                     Payment for training courses for this exam
                                     Internet service

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION

                                 5.   Which of the following would not be included in the safe harbor provisions of
                                      Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934?
                                       A. Proprietary research
                                       B. Third-party research
                                       C. Rent
                                       D. Seminar registration fees
                                      Answer: C. Section 28(e) provides a safe harbor for those expenses paid with
                                      soft dollars that offer a direct research benefit. Rent is not included in the list of
                                      acceptable items coming under that safe harbor.

              INTRODUCTION
                         Books and records are an essential part of a broker-dealer’s life. It could be the account records,
                         with all of the details about the customer. It could be the details of a transaction, as shown on
                         the confirmation. It could be the records relating to the internal operations of the firm. There
                         are loads of them. Those records, and their retention requirements are delineated in SEC Rules
                         17a-3 and 17a-4.

                         Introduction
                         It is FINRA’s contention that customer confirmations help protect investors by allowing
                         them to verify the terms of their transactions, alerting them to potential conflicts of interest,

                                        transactions and the quality of their broker-dealer’s execution.


                                        Customer Confirmations
                                        There are two principal tested items on this topic:
                                         What is included on a customer confirmation?
                                         When is the confirmation sent?


                                        Confirmation Contents
                                        A trade confirmation is a document that confirms a trade of a security. It applies if the
                                        customer is buying or selling a security. On the face of the confirmation is the amount of
                                        money due from or owed to the customer. It will also include the date the money changes
                                        hands. That is the settlement date. The basic requirements for confirmation are found in
                                        SEC Rule 10b-10, FINRA Rule 2232, and MSRB Rule G-15.

                                        Appropriate to the specific trade, those rules require the confirmation to contain
                                         whether the member acted as agent or principal (capacity);
                                         whether the member acted as dual agent (dual agency occurs when a firm represents cus­
                                          tomers on both sides of the trade—the buyer and the seller—and charging each side a
                                          com­mission);
                                         the source and amount of commission in an agency trade;
                                         whether a control relationship exists between the issuer and member;
                                         a description of the deferred sales load, if any;
                                         the markup or markdown charged retail customers when acting in a principal capacity (it
                                          is unlikely the exceptions will be tested);
                                         the identity of the shares or units as well as the price and number of shares (if the trade
                                          price on the confirmation is incorrect, the actual price prevails);
                                         the total par value of the trade of debt securities;
                                         the accrued interest in a trade of debt securities;
                                         if the member is a market maker in the security;
                                         the date and time of the transaction execution or a statement that it will be furnished
                                          upon request;

                       When-, As-, and If-Issued Contracts (When-Issued Trades)
                       Typically, new municipal bond issues are sold to investors before the bonds are issued and
                       available for delivery. An investor receives a when-issued confirmation describing the bonds.
                       The confirmation does not include a total dollar amount or settlement date because, until
                       the settlement date is known, the accrued interest cannot be calculated to determine the total
                       dollar amount. Once the bonds are issued, the investor receives a new confirmation stating the
                       purchase price and settlement date.

                       A when-issued transaction confirmation must include
                        a description of the security;
                        the purchase price (dollar bond) or yield (serial bond); and
                        the trade date.
                       Because the settlement date is unknown, a when-issued confirmation for bonds cannot
                       include accrued interest. That means it will not show the total dollar amount due.


                       Electronic Delivery of Information
                       In keeping with today’s digital age, FINRA allows members to electronically send documents,
                       such as confirmations and account statements, to customers as long as certain conditions are
                       met. To do so, the firm must have procedures in place to show that the information sent has
                       been delivered as intended and that the confidentiality and security of personal information
                       are protected. Furthermore, customers must provide written consent to electronic delivery.

                       In addition, a customer who consents to receive information and documents electronically
                       must be provided with the information in paper form, upon request.

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 Copies of customer confirma­tions must be retained for three years.

                       Customer Account Statements
                       Members are required to send statements to customers at least quarterly. You should
                       remember from Lesson 3.5 that, in the case of penny stocks, statements are sent monthly even
                       when there is no account activity. Account activity includes, but is not limited to, purchases,
                       sales, interest credits or debits, charges or credits, dividend payments, transfer activity,
                       securities receipts or deliveries, and/or journal entries relating to securities or funds in the
                       possession or control of the member. In addition to the obvious activity just mentioned, all
                       positions, short and long, and cash balances and money owed are shown.

                       For most securities, the positions are shown at current market value. But, what if the

                                                                                                                                  Unit 15
                       customer’s account contains illiquid investments?

                       The FINRA rule specifically refers to DPPs and unlisted REITs. A general securities member
                       must include in a customer account statement a per share estimated value of a DPP or
                       unlisted REIT security, developed in a manner reasonably designed to ensure that the per
                       share estimated value is reliable.

                                        There are several methods that can be used to estimate the value. It is unlikely any of these
                                        will be on the exam, but, just in case, they follow.


                                        Net Investment
                                        Net investment is based on the “amount available for investment” percentage in the Estimated
                                        Use of Proceeds section of the offering prospectus. When the issuer provides a range of amounts
                                        available for investment, the member may use the maximum offering percentage unless the
                                        member has reason to believe that such percentage is unreliable, in which case the member
                                        must use the minimum offering percentage.


                                        Appraised Value
                                        At any time, the member may include a per share estimated value reflecting an appraised
                                        valuation, which must be
                                         based on valuations of the assets and liabilities of the DPP or REIT performed at least
                                          annually, by, or with the material assistance or confirmation of a third-party valuation
                                          expert or service and
                                         derived from a methodology that conforms to standard industry practice.


                                        Disclosures
                                        “Any account statement that provides a per share estimated value for a DPP or REIT security
                                        shall disclose that the DPP or REIT securities are not listed on a national securities exchange,
                                        are generally illiquid and that, even if a customer is able to sell the securities, the price
                                        received may be less than the per share estimated value provided in the account statement.”
                                        —from FINRA Rule 2231.

                                        In January of each year, members must send statements to customers showing a summary of
                                        all interest and dividends credited to the account as well as the gross proceeds of all sales made
                                        the prior year. The statement is sent to the account owner and to the IRS on Form 1099.

                                        With respect to joint accounts, the statement is sent to the person whose Social Security
                                        number is on the account. Although the member collects information on all parties in a joint
                                        account, each account has a primary Social Security number.

                                        Customer account statements must include a statement advising customers to promptly report
                                        any discrepancy or inaccuracy to the brokerage firm and, if applicable, the clearing firm. It
                                        is the same concept as your bank or credit card statements where you are told to promptly
                                        report any errors.

                       Updating Customer Account Information
                       As we learned in Lesson 1.4, each retail customer who opens a new account must, within 30
                       days of the opening of the account, be furnished with a copy of the account record. This is
                       to ensure that the information obtained by the firm, particularly suitability information, is
                       correct.

                       For updating purposes, the member firm must send a copy of the account record to customers
                       at least every 36 months thereaf­ter. Supervisors always must, however, look for red flags,
                       which may indicate something has changed in the circumstances of the customer.

                       If the customer should notify the firm of any changes to the account record, such as change
                       in name, address, or investment objectives, the firm must send a copy of the updated account
                       record within 30 days of receiving notice of the change. Another important update is when
                       the client’s employment situation changes. There are two reasons for that.

                       First, it may have an effect on suitability. A promotion would likely enable the client to take
                       somewhat more aggressive actions. A demotion or unemployment would have the opposite
                       effect. Therefore, it may become necessary to revise the client’s investment objectives.
                       Second, broker-dealers always have to be aware of client’s being employed by publicly traded
                       companies. That dramatically increases the possibility of the client acquiring MNPI. That
                       raises a red flag if the client makes a trade in that stock.

                       A broker-dealer must retain records of all of the identification information obtained from the
                       customer under the CIP for five years after the account is closed.

                       By contrast, records made about the CIP information verifying a customer’s identity have to
                       be retained for only five years after the record is made.

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 Accounts that are acquired through acquisition of another member firm are not
                                 subject to customer identification procedures. It can be presumed that the other
                                 member fulfilled its obligation.


                       LO 15.d Identify the steps in transferring accounts to another broker-dealer.



                       Introduction
                       An important process is the transferring of customer accounts from one member firm to
                       another. Customers can have all kinds of reasons for making the change. It can also happen
                       when a registered representative leaves one firm and goes to another. In many cases, clients
                       follow the rep to the new firm. We’ll cover the special FINRA rule dealing with registered
                       representatives “taking” clients with them. In other cases, an older client passes away and the
                       children who inherit the account wish to move it to the firm handling their account. The
                       industry recognizes that “you win some and you lose some,” and these transfers must be fluid.

                                                                                                                                  Unit 15
                       That is what the Automated Customer Account Transfer Service (ACATS) is all about.


                       Transferring Customer Accounts Between Member Firms
                       When a customer whose securities account is carried by a member (the carrying member)
                       wants to transfer the account to another member (the receiving member), the customer must




Series_7_2E.indb 393                                                                                                  11/19/2021 7:54:22 PM

                                        sign an account transfer form. This form is called the broker-to-broker transfer instruction
                                        form (TIF). The Automated Customer Account Transfer Service (ACATS) automates and
                                        standardizes the procedure for the transfer. The TIF is sent immediately to ACATS by the
                                        receiving firm. For purposes of this rule, customer authorization could be the customer’s
                                        actual signature or an electronic signature.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    It may help your understanding to think of the carrying firm as the losing firm (it is
                                                    losing the account) and the receiving firm as the winning firm (it is gaining the new
                                                    account).
                                        Once forwarded and received by the carrying firm, it has one business day to validate the
                                        securities listed on the TIF or take exception to the transfer instructions. If there are no
                                        exceptions, within three business days following validation, the carrying firm must complete
                                        the transfer of the account.

                                        No member may interfere with a customer’s request to transfer an account in connection with
                                        the change in employment of the customer’s registered representative when the account is not
                                        subject to any lien for monies owed by the customer or other bona fide claim.


                                        Following a Registered Representative From One Member Firm to
                                        Another
                                        When registered representatives move to a new firm and try to convince former customers to
                                        move with them, FINRA Rule 2273 requires certain disclosures to be made. Those disclosures
                                        are provided in educational material outlining things for the customer to consider, including
                                        financial incentives that could rise to a conflict of interest for the rep.

                                        The FINRA required educational communication highlights the following potential
                                        implications of transferring assets to the new firm:
                                         Whether financial incentives received by the representative may create a conflict of
                                          interest
                                         That some assets may not be directly transferrable to the recruiting firm and, as a result,
                                          the customer may incur costs to liquidate and move those assets or account maintenance
                                          fees to leave them with his current firm
                                         Potential costs related to transferring assets to the recruiting firm, including differences in
                                          the pricing structure and fees imposed by the customer’s current firm and the recruiting
                                          firm
                                         Differences in products and services between the customer’s current firm and the
                                          recruiting firm

                                        The rule states that a member who hires a registered person must provide to a former
                                        customer (a natural person), in paper or electronic form, the educational communication
                                        when
                                         the member, directly or through that registered person, individually contacts the former
                                          customer to transfer assets; or
                                         the former customer, absent individualized contact, transfers assets to an account assigned
                                          to the registered person associated with that member firm.

                                        The communication is required at the time of contact with a former customer by the
                                        registered person or the member firm regarding transferring assets.

                         Contacting the customer may be done with written, electronic, or oral communication.
                         Electronic communication may include a hyperlink directly to the educational
                         communication. If the contact is oral, the member or registered person must notify the
                         former customer that an educational communication that includes important considerations
                         in deciding whether to transfer assets to the member will be provided not later than three
                         business days after the contact.

                         If a former customer attempts to transfer assets, but no individualized contact with the former
                         customer by the registered person or member occurs before the former customer seeks to
                         transfer assets, the member must deliver the educational communication with the account
                         transfer approval documentation.

                         The delivery of the communication applies for three months following the date the registered
                         person begins employment or associates with the member.

                         FINRA Rule 2273 is not applicable when a former customer who is contacted to transfer
                         assets expressly states that she is not interested in transferring assets to the member. If
                         the former customer later decides to transfer assets to the new member without further
                         individualized contact within three months following the date the registered person begins
                         employment with the member, then the educational material must be sent. This rule is also
                         not applicable to institutional accounts; it is solely for natural persons.

                         LO 15.e Name the books and records retention requirements.



                         Introduction
                         We have covered many of these in the appropriate lessons so this will be more of a summary
                         than anything else.


                         Records to Be Made
                         The rules dealing with recordkeeping are SEC Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4 and FINRA Rule 4511.
                         Rule 17a-3 lists the records to be kept. If you were taking a principal’s exam, you would need
                         extensive knowledge of this. For this exam, it is just the basics.


                         SEC Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4
                         SEC Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4 address what records must be prepared by members, when such
                         records must be prepared, and for how long such records must be retained. For retention
                         purposes, records are either lifetime records, six-year records, or three-year records. As you
                         will learn in Unit 18, FINRA's recordkeeping rules diverge by requiring records of written
                                                                                                                                   Unit 15
                         customer complaints to be retained four years.

                                                   Customer complaints are a four-year record (FINRA rule and answer on the exam).
                                                   Whether a record retention requirement is six, four, or three years, records for the two
                                                   most recent years must be in a readily accessible location.

                                                   Trade blotters are a daily record of all activity, including cash received and dis­bursed,

                                                   that day. The daily blotter would not contain client information or settlement dates.
                                                   Blotters must be posted no later than the first business day follow­ing the activity.

                                       accounts.

                                       Most of the FINRA and SEC rules regarding the handling and insuring of customer accounts
                                       have been mentioned in one unit or another. This learning objective is contains several items
                                       that have not been covered.


                                       Death of an Account Holder
                                       With regard to individual accounts, once a firm becomes aware of the death of the account
                                       owner, the firm must cancel all open orders, mark the account deceased, and freeze the assets
                                       in the account until receiving instructions and the necessary documentation from the executor
                                       of the decedent’s estate. If the account has a third-party power of attorney, the authorization is
                                       revoked.

                                TAKE NOTE
                                Discretionary authority ends at the death of the account owner.

                      Depending on the type of account, the documents necessary to release the assets of a decedent
                      are
                       a certified copy of the death certificate,
                       inheritance tax waivers, and
                       letters testamentary.
                      If one party in a joint tenants with rights of survivorship (JTWROS) account dies, the
                      account cannot be transferred to the name of the new owner (the other party) until a certified
                      copy of the death certificate is presented to the member firm. The other documents noted
                      earlier are not needed to transfer ownership at death in a JTWROS account.

                      If one party in a tenants in common (TIC) account dies, the decedent’s interest in the
                      account goes to the decedent’s estate. The executor for the decedent must present the proper
                      documents before the assets belonging to the decedent can be released. In some states, the
                      death of a tenant in a TIC account requires that the executor present an affidavit of domicile
                      to the member that shows the decedent’s estate will be handled under the laws of that state.

                      Also note that in TIC accounts, the death of a tenant requires that the member firm freeze the
                      account and acceptance of orders until the required documents are presented. Compare this
                      with a JTWROS account, for which the death of one tenant does not preclude the remaining
                      tenant from entering orders.

                      With regard to partnership accounts, if one partner dies, the member needs written authority
                      from the remaining partners before executing any further orders. In essence, the account is
                      frozen until receiving the proper papers. This written authorization generally takes the form of
                      an amended partnership agreement.

                                Three basic steps apply at the death of a customer:
                                    Cancel open orders
                                    Freeze the account (mark it deceased)
                                    Await instructions from the executor of the estate


                      Holding Customers’ Mail
                      A customer gives specific mailing instructions when opening a new account. Statements and
                      confirmations may be sent to someone who holds power of attorney for the customer if the
                      customer requests it in writing and if duplicate confirms are also sent to the customer.

                      FINRA rules permit member firms to hold mail for a customer (e.g., statements and
                      confirmations) who will not be receiving mail provided that

                                                                                                                               Unit 15
                       the member firm receives written instructions that include the time period the request is
                        being made for up to three months (requests may be granted for periods longer than three
                        months for an acceptable reason such as safety or security concerns but not merely for the
                        sake of convenience);
                       the member firm informs the customer of any alternate meth­ods that the customer may
                        use to receive or monitor account activity such as email or through the member firm’s




Series7_15.indd 397                                                                                                    15/12/22 12:06 PM

                                             website (the member must obtain customer confirmation that this information regarding
                                             alternate methods was received); and
                                         the member verifies at reasonable intervals that the customer’s instructions still apply.
                                        Additionally, during that time that a member firm is holding mail for a customer, the firm
                                        must be able to communicate with the customer in a timely manner to provide impor­
                                        tant account information. The firm must take actions reasonably designed to ensure that a
                                        customer’s mail is not tampered with or used in a manner that would violate FINRA rules or
                                        federal securities laws.

                                        While holding mail is a courtesy that firms may extend to customers, the rule does not require
                                        them to. If extending the courtesy is consistent with the broker-dealer’s in-house rules, the
                                        written request by the customer to do so implies that the customer is also giving the broker-
                                        dealer permission to do so.


                                        Approval and Documentation of Changes in Account Name or
                                        Designation
                                        FINRA Rule 4515 says: “Before any customer order is executed, there must be placed upon
                                        the order form or other similar record, the name or designation of the account (or accounts)
                                        for which such order is to be executed. No change in such account name(s) (including
                                        related accounts) or designation(s) shall be made unless the change has been authorized by a
                                        registered principal.”


                                        Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Compliance
                                        FINRA Rule 3310 requires member firms to develop, implement, and monitor anti-money
                                        laundering (AML) programs designed to achieve compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and
                                        related regulations. The firm’s anti-money laundering (AML) program must be approved
                                        in writing by a member of senior management. If the approving senior man­ager leaves the
                                        member firm, the AML program should be reapproved by the new manager. Specifically, the
                                        rules would require member firms to
                                         establish and implement policies and procedures that can be reasonably expected to detect
                                          and cause the reporting of transactions that raise a suspicion of money laundering;
                                         establish and implement policies, procedures, and internal controls reasonably designed to
                                          achieve compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act;
                                         designate to FINRA an individual or individuals responsible for implementing and moni­
                                          toring the day-to-day operations and internal controls of the program; and
                                         provide ongoing training for appropriate personnel.


                                        Currency Transaction Report (CTR)
                                        The Bank Secrecy Act requires broker-dealers to report on FinCEN Form 112 any currency
                                        depos­ited or received in excess of $10,000 on a single day. This requirement applies to
                                        cash transactions used to pay off loans, the electronic transfer of funds, or the purchase of
                                        certificates of deposit, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or other investments. The act also requires
                                        the reporting of wire transfers of $3,000 or more.

                       Though paying for purchased securities with currency is not prohibited, many firms do not
                       permit this. Failure to report can result in fines of up to $500,000, 10 years in prison, or both.
                       The record retention requirements for Form 112 are five years.

                       Form 112 must be E-filed within 15 days of receipt of the currency. This rule is part of the
                       regulatory effort to deal with money laundering. The two federal agencies empowered to deal
                       with this abuse are the Federal Reserve and the Department of the Treasury.


                       AML Compliance Program
                       Broker-dealers are required to establish internal compliance procedures to detect abuses. There
                       are signs—or red flags—that might suggest the possibility of money laundering. If one of
                       these is detected, prompt reporting to the appropriate principal is required. Examples of red
                       flags include a customer
                        exhibiting a lack of concern regarding risks, commissions, or other transaction costs;
                        attempting to make frequent or large deposits of currency or cashier’s checks;
                        making a large number of wire transfers to unrelated third parties;
                        engaging in excessive transfers between unrelated accounts; and
                        designing currency deposits or withdrawals to fall under the $10,000 cash transaction
                         report filing threshold. This is a practice known as structuring.

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 1.   A broker-dealer would have to complete a Form 112 when a customer
                                       A. deposits $10,000 in cash to his account.
                                       B. deposits $10,000.01 in cash to her account.
                                       C. wires $3,500 to an offshore bank.
                                       D. and child deposits a personal check for $11,000 into their TIC account.
                                      Answer: B. The cash reporting requirements for Form 112 apply when the cash
                                      transaction exceeds $10,000. This is true when the excess is only a penny. Wires
                                      of more than $3,000 must be reported, but not on Form 112. Personal checks,
                                      regardless of the amount, are not recorded.

              INTRODUCTION
                         As a general securities registered representative, one of the functions you might be performing is
                         entering orders for customers. Understanding the different types of orders and their applications
                         is necessary when acting in this role. Likewise, recognizing securities quotations is critical.
                         Perhaps some of your clients will engage in more aggressive strategies, such as margin trading
                         and short selling. You may be called upon to explain how the calculations behind these strategies
                         work. That is why this exam tests you on them.


              LESSON 16.1: TYPES OF CUSTOMER ORDERS

                         LO 16.a Name the different types of orders available to customers.



                         Price-Restricted Orders
                         Some orders, such as limit and stop-limit, restrict the price of the transaction. Typical orders
                         include the following:
                          Market. Executed immediately at the market price.

                                         Limit. Limits the amount paid or received for securities.
                                         Stop. Becomes a market order if the stock reaches or goes through the stop (trigger or
                                          election) price.
                                         Stop-limit. Entered as a stop order and changed to a limit order if the stock hits or goes
                                          through the stop (trigger or election) price.

                                                     PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                     1.   Which of the following types of orders does not restrict the price at which an order is
                                                          executed?
                                                           A. Limit
                                                           B. Stop
                                                           C. Market
                                                           D. Stop-limit
                                                          Answer: C. A market order does not reflect or restrict the price at which a security is
                                                          executed. A limit order limits the amount to be paid or received for securities. A stop
                                                          order becomes a market order if the stock reaches or goes through the stop price.
                                                          A stop-limit order becomes a limit order if the stock hits or goes through the trigger
                                                          price.


                                        Market Orders
                                        Market orders are sent immediately to the trading floor for execution without restrictions or
                                        limits. They are executed immediately at the current market price and have priority over all
                                        other types of orders. A market order to buy is executed at the lowest offering price available;
                                        a market order to sell is executed at the highest bid price available. Those prices are usually
                                        referred to as the inside market or inside quote. As long as the security is trading, a market
                                        order guarantees execution. When the objective of the client is immediate execution, use a
                                        market order.


                                        Limit Orders
                                        In a limit order, a customer limits the acceptable purchase or selling price. A limit order can
                                        be executed only at the specified price or better. If the order cannot be executed at the limit
                                        price immediately, it is placed on the designated market maker’s (DMM’s) book and executed
                                        when and if the market price meets the order limit price. Buy limit orders are placed below
                                        the current market, whereas sell limit orders are placed above the current market. Buy limit
                                        orders are used by investors who believe a stock is currently overpriced, but would like to buy
                                        on a dip in the market. Investors who own a stock and believe it is currently undervalued turn
                                        in sell limit orders getting them out of the position should the stock rise to the desired level.


                                        Length of Limit Orders
                                        Limit orders can be turned in with one or two different time restrictions. They can be good
                                        for the day entered (day order), or good ‘til canceled (GTC), sometimes referred to as an open
                                        order. We will discuss these a bit later.


                                        Risks of Limit Orders
                                        A customer who enters a limit order risks missing the chance to buy or sell, especially if the
                                        market moves away from the limit price. The market may never go as low as the buy limit

                       price or as high as the sell limit price. Sometimes limit orders are not executed, even if the
                       stock trades at the limit price.

                       Why would that happen? A term you should be aware of is stock ahead. Limit orders on

                                                                                                                                      Unit 16
                       limit order at a specific price was not filled, chances are another order at the same price took
                       precedence—that is, there was stock ahead.

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 Limit orders stand in time priority. There may be multiple orders to buy a stock at a
                                 particular price. Once the stock begins trading at that price, those limit orders that
                                 were entered first will be filled first.


                       Stop Orders
                       A stop order, also known as a stop-loss order, is designed to protect a profit or prevent a loss
                       if the stock begins to move in the wrong direction.

                       The stop order becomes a market order once the stock trades at or moves through a certain
                       price, known as the stop price. Stop orders are left with and executed by the DMM. There is
                       no guarantee the executed price will be the stop price, unlike the price on a limit order. Buy
                       stop orders are entered above the current market, whereas sell stop orders are entered below
                       the current market.

                       A trade at the stop price triggers the order, which then becomes a market order. A stop order
                       takes two trades to execute, which are as follows:
                        Trigger. The trigger transaction at or through the stop price activates the trade.
                        Execution. The stop order becomes a market order and is executed at the next price,
                         completing the trade.


                       Buy Stop Order
                       A buy stop order protects a profit or limits a loss in a short stock position. The buy stop is
                       entered at a price above the current market and is triggered when the market price touches or
                       goes through the buy stop price.

                                 EXAMPLE
                                 A customer has shorted 1,000 shares of XYZ stock at $55, and the stock is now at $48.
                                 The customer would like to hang on for more gain but is concerned the stock will
                                 reverse itself and begin to rise, eroding some of the unrealized profit. To deal with
                                 this, the customer could place the following order: buy 1,000 XYZ 49 stop. If the stock
                                 does start to head north, once it trades at or through the stop price of 49, the order
                                 becomes a market order to buy 1,000 XYZ.
                       Buy stop orders are also used by technical traders who track support and resistance levels
                       for stocks. For instance, collect on delivery (COD) stock trades between 38 and 42. It never
                       seems to go above 42 or below 38. Technicians believe that if the stock breaks through
                       resistance, it will continue to move upward at a rapid pace. Therefore, they will not buy at 40
                       because there is little upside potential. However, they may place a buy stop order above the
                       resistance level, knowing that if the stock breaks resistance and begins to move up, they will
                       buy the stock before it develops upward momentum.

                                        An investor might place a stop order to buy 100 COD at 42.25 stop when the market is at

                                        A sell stop order protects a profit or limits a loss in a long stock position and is entered at a
                                        price below the current market.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     A customer is long 1,000 shares of XYZ at $32, and the stock is now at $41. The
                                                     customer would like to hang on for more gain but is concerned the stock will reverse
                                                     itself and begin to fall, eroding some of the unrealized profit. To deal with this, the
                                                     customer could place the following order: sell 1,000 XYZ 40 stop. If the stock does start
                                                     to head south, once it trades at or through the stop price of 40, the order becomes a
                                                     market order to sell 1,000 XYZ.
                                        Technical traders also use sell stop orders. They believe that if a stock breaks through support,
                                        it will fall like a rock. Therefore, they will not short the stock at 40 because there is little
                                        downside potential. Historically, the stock has not traded below 38.

                                        However, they may place a sell stop order just below the support level, knowing that if the
                                        stock breaks through support and begins to move down, they will short the stock before it
                                        develops downward momentum.

                                        An investor who is long stock might place a stop order to sell 100 COD at 37.75 stop when
                                        the market is at 40 if he believes 38 represents a technical support point below which the
                                        stock will continue to fall.

                                                  If a large number of stop orders are triggered at the same price, a flurry of trading activity
                                                  takes place as they become market orders. This activity will accelerate the advance or decline
                                                  of the stock price.


                                                  Stop-Limit Order
                                                  A stop-limit order is a stop order that once triggered, becomes a limit order instead of a
                                                  market order.

                                                               EXAMPLE
                                                               A customer calls you and says, “I want to sell my ABC stock if it falls to $30, but I don’t
                                                               want less than $29.95 for my shares.” So you enter the following order: sell 1,000 ABC
                                                               30 stop 29.95. Once ABC trades at or below 30, the order becomes a limit order to sell
                                                               at 29.95 or better. The problem here is that the market could leapfrog between the
                                                               stop price and the limit price. As a result, the customer will not get an execution.
                                                               Assume once the order is entered, the stock trades as follows: 30.01, 29.97, 29.94,
                                                               29.92, and so on. The trade at 29.97 triggers the order, at which point the order
                                                               becomes a limit order to sell at 29.95 or better (higher). In this scenario, the customer
                                                               does not sell. The moral of this example is if you are concerned that a stock is heading
                                                               south, place a market order to sell or a stop order. A stop-limit may leave you without
                                                               an execution.

                                        Let’s take a walk through some of the possibilities.

                                        XYZ is currently trading at 52. Where would a customer enter a buy limit order?

                                        Refer to the chart. Think of the horizontal middle line as the current price. The buy limit
                                        would be entered somewhere below 52. The investor wants to buy at a better price—a lower
                                        price for a buyer. The order would be filled at or below the order price.

                                        A sell limit order for XYZ would be entered above the market price. The seller is waiting for a
                                        price that is better than 52. The order would be filled at a price equal to or higher (better for a
                                        seller) than the order price.

                                        Stop orders are a little trickier because they have two parts: trigger (election) and execution.
                                        Consider a buy stop at 52 entered when the market is 51. Based on the ticks below, at what
                                        price would this order be executed?

                                        51.88      51.99      52.13       52.13     51.88

                                        Look at the chart. The chart shows you that a buy stop is entered above the market price.
                                        This reminds you that it is only elected or triggered at the first price where the market is at or
                                        above the order price. Stops become market orders when triggered, so it executes at the price
                                        immediately following the trigger. Based on this example, this buy stop triggers at 52.13 and
                                        could execute at 52.13.

                                        If this had been a buy stop-limit at 52, the trigger would still be 52.13. Just as before, it
                                        triggers at or above the order price. When a stop-limit is triggered, it becomes a limit order,
                                        which means it will execute only at a price at or below the stated price (lower is better for a
                                        buyer).

                                        Based on this example, this buy stop-limit triggers at 52.13 and could execute at 51.88.

                                        Consider a sell stop at 52 entered when the market is 53. Based on the ticks shown below, at
                                        what price could this order be executed?

                                        52.50       51.88         51.50     51.75      52.25

                                        The chart shows you that a sell stop is entered below the market price. This reminds you that
                                        it is only elected or triggered when the market is at or below the order price. Stops become
                                        market orders when triggered, so it executes at the next available price immediately following
                                        the trigger. Based on this example, this sell stop triggers at 51.88 and executes at 51.50.

                                        If this had been a sell stop-limit at 52, the trigger would still be 51.88. Just as before, it
                                        triggers at or below the order price. When a stop-limit is triggered, it becomes a limit order,
                                        which means it will execute only at a price at or above the stated price (higher is better for a
                                        seller). This sell stop-limit triggers at 51.88 and could execute at 52.25.

                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                  2.   UZEW is trading at 40.63. Your customer, who owns 100 shares of the stock, places an
                                       order to sell UZEW at 39.87 stop-limit. The tape subsequently reports the following
                                       trades:

                                                                                                                                        Unit 16
                                       UZEW 40.63 40.75 40.05 39.83 39.80 39.93

                                       Your customer’s order could first be executed at
                                         A.   39.80.
                                         B.   39.83.
                                         C.   39.93.
                                         D.   40.63.
                                       Answer: C. The sell stop-limit order is elected (triggered) at the trade of 39.83. That
                                       is the first time the stock trades at or below the stop price of 39.87. The order then
                                       becomes a sell limit order at 39.87. The order can be executed at that price or higher
                                       (the limit placed by the customer). The next trade reported after the trigger is reached
                                       (39.80) is below the limit price. The order could be executed at the next trade of 39.93.

                       When drawing your order reference chart, think of the phrase, SLoBS over BLiSS. It stands
                       for Sell Limits and Buy Stops over Buy Limits and Sell Stops. SLoBS tells you the orders placed
                       above the current market price (The o reminds you that the orders are over the market price.
                       BLiSS refers to orders placed below the current market price. B in BLiSS reminds you of B in
                       below.).

                       Why use stop orders?

                       Buy stop orders                                        Sell stop orders

                         position,                                              position,
                        protect a gain from a short stock position,           protect a gain from a long stock
                         and                                                    position, and
                        establish a long position when a breakout             establish a short position when a
                         occurs above the line of resistance.                   breakout occurs below the line of
                                                                                support.
                       There is no guarantee that if a stop order is elected (triggered), the investor will pay or receive
                       the stop price. Because it is a marker order that is entered after being triggered, the price can
                       be more, less, or the same as the stop price. If the investor wants a specified price (or better),
                       then it must be a stop-limit order. With that, you have the risk that the order might be
                       triggered, but never executed.


                       Reducing Orders
                       Certain orders on the DMM’s order book are reduced when a stock goes ex‑dividend. All
                       orders entered below the market are reduced on the ex-dividend date (or ex-date)—the first
                       date on which the new owner (purchaser) of stock does not qualify for the current dividend.
                       On the ex-date, the stock price opens lower by the amount of the distribution. Orders
                       reduced include buy limit and sell stops, including sell stop-limit orders. These orders are
                       reduced by the dividend amount. Without this reduction, trading at the lower price on the
                       ex-dividend date could cause an inadvertent execution.

           410         Unit 16   Types of Orders and Quotations



                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     ABC closes at 35.00. The following day is the ex-date for a $0.31 cash dividend.
                                                     ABC stock should open at 34.69. Without the reduction, a sell stop order at 35 could be
                                                     triggered even though the lower price is not due to market forces.


                                        Do Not Reduce (DNR)
                                        A do not reduce (DNR) order is not reduced by an ordinary cash dividend. In this case, the
                                        customer does not care if there is an execution due solely to the ex-date reduction.

                                                     TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                     You are likely to be asked which orders are reduced for cash dividends. Only those
                                                     placed below the market price are automatically reduced. Remember that BLiSS
                                                     (buy limits and sell stops) orders are placed below the market price and are reduced
                                                     for cash dividend distributions. All orders are adjusted for stock dividends and stock
                                                     splits, whether placed above or below the market.


                                        Reductions for Stock Splits
                                        If there is a stock dividend or stock split, the DMM will adjust all open orders.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     There is an open (GTC) order to sell 100 XYZ at 50 stop. If there is a 2:1 split, the order
                                                     becomes sell 200 XYZ at 25 stop.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     There is an open order to buy 500 XYZ at 30. If there is a 20% stock dividend, the order
                                                     becomes buy 600 XYZ at 25.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     There is an open order to buy 100 XYZ at 30. If there is a 20% stock dividend, the order
                                                     becomes buy 100 XYZ at 25. Common sense says the order size should be 120 shares.
                                                     However, only round lots are allowed on the order book. The additional 20 shares are
                                                     in the customer’s account but cannot be part of an open order. For reverse splits, all
                                                     open orders are canceled.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     The standard trading unit for stocks is normally 100 shares. We call that a round lot.
                                                     Any quantity less than a round lot is known as an odd-lot. Lesson 17.3 will delve further
                                                     into the topic of round lots and odd lots.

                                     Answer: A. When a stock goes ex-dividend, the price of the stock falls by the amount
                                     of the dividend. A dividend of $0.70 would reduce the stop price by that amount.


                      Time-Sensitive Orders
                      Orders based on time considerations include the following:                                                 Unit 16
                       Day
                       Good until canceled
                       At-the-open and market-on-close
                       Not held
                       Fill-or-kill
                       Immediate-or-cancel
                       All-or-none
                       Alternative, which provides two alternatives, such as sell a stock at a limit or sell it on stop


                      Day Orders
                      Unless marked to the contrary, an open order (stop or limit) is assumed to be a day order,
                      valid only until the close of trading on the day it is entered. If the order has not been filled, it
                      is canceled at the close of the day’s trading.


                      Good Til Canceled (GTC) Orders
                      GTC orders are valid until executed or canceled. However, all GTC orders are automatically
                      canceled if unexecuted for the number of days (often 30 to 90) set by the individual broker-
                      dealer. If the customer wishes to have the order remain working beyond those specific days,
                      the customer must reenter the order. An example would be, Buy 20M GGZ 9% Debentures at
                      95 AON GTC. This is a GTC order that also has an all-or-none specification.


                      At-the-Open and Market-on-Close Orders
                      At-the-open orders are executed at the opening of the market. Partial executions are allowable.
                      They must reach the post by the open of trading in that security or they will be canceled.
                      Market-on-close orders are executed at or as near as possible to the closing price in the OTC
                      market. On the NYSE, however, a market-on-close order must be entered before 3:40 pm ET
                      and will be executed at the closing price.


                      Not Held (NH) Orders
                      A market order coded NH (not held) indicates that the customer agrees not to hold the
                      floor broker or broker-dealer to a particular time or price of execution. This provides the
                      floor broker with the authority to decide the best time or price at which to execute the trade.
                      Market NH orders may not be placed with the NYSE DMM.

                                                     they are day orders. An exception is granted if the customer, in writing, states that the
                                                     order is GTC.


                                        Fill-or-Kill (FOK) Orders
                                        The commission house broker is instructed to fill an entire fill-or-kill (FOK) order
                                        immediately at the limit price or better. A broker who cannot fill the entire order immediately
                                        cancels it and notifies the originating branch office.


                                        Immediate-or-Cancel (IOC) Orders
                                        Immediate-or-cancel (IOC) orders are like FOK orders except that a partial execution is
                                        acceptable. The portion not executed is canceled.


                                        All-or-None (AON) Orders
                                        All-or-none (AON) orders must be executed in their entirety or not at all. AON orders
                                        can be day or GTC orders. They differ from the FOKs in that they do not have to be filled
                                        immediately.


                                        Alternative Orders (OCO)
                                        Assume a customer is long stock at $50 that was purchased six months earlier at $30. To
                                        protect his unrealized gain, the customer might enter a sell stop at $48. Alternatively, if
                                        the stock continues to rise, he wants out at $53. What he might do is enter both orders
                                        with the notation, one cancels the other (OCO). If one of the orders is executed, the other is
                                        immediately canceled.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     Exchanges can limit the order types they will accept. For instance, the NYSE and
                                                     Nasdaq do not accept GTC or stop orders (stop-loss or stop-limit) or AON or FOK
                                                     orders to be entered in their equity markets. Because these different order types are
                                                     also used in the bond market, students should still be familiar with them and be able
                                                     to distinguish them from other order types. Additionally, though an exchange might
                                                     not accept them, broker-dealers are still able to do so if they wish to. However, they
                                                     would need to manually monitor the status of the order if entered on an exchange that
                                                     does not accept them.

                                                     customer.


              LESSON 16.2: QUOTATIONS

                                     LO 16.b Name the different types of quotes.



                                     Introduction
                                     In many cases, before customers place an order, they want to know the approximate price they
                                     will be paying or receiving. The information is relayed to the client by furnishing a quotation
                                     or quote. This lesson will describe the various quotes supplied by securities firms.


                                     Bids, Offers, and Quotes
                                     Quotations are available for both listed and unlisted securities. In the case of stocks traded on
                                     the NYSE, the quotes come from the DMM. These are available electronically, even to retail
                                     investors. In the case of the OTC market, the quotations originate with the market makers.
                                     Exam questions are more likely to focus on them than on the DMM, at least when it comes
                                     to understanding the types of quotes.

                                     The OTC market has no DMMs. Instead, firms wishing to make a market in a particular
                                     security must register with, and receive approval from, FINRA. They buy and sell for their
                                     own inventories, for their own profit, and at their own risk. A broker-dealer acting as a market
                                     maker, buying and selling for his own account rather than arranging trades, acts as a principal,
                                     not an agent. Another way to describe this is proprietary trading.

           414         Unit 16   Types of Orders and Quotations



                                        A full quote consists of a bid price and an offer (ask) price. When coming from the market
                                        maker, it will also include the size.

                                        The current bid is the highest price at which the market maker will pay to buy, and the
                                        current offer is the lowest price at which the market maker will accept to sell. The difference
                                        between the bid and ask is known as the spread. A typical quote might be expressed as bid
                                        63–offered 63.07. The highest price the dealer will pay is 63, and the lowest price the dealer
                                        will accept is 63.07. The spread is 0.07 of a point between the bid and ask. The firm could
                                        also say 63 bid–63.07 ask or 63 to 0.07.

           Figure 16.5: The Customer’s and the Market Maker’s Relationship to the Quote
                                       Bid-63      Ask/Offer-63.07
             Quoting dealer             Buys            Sells
             Customer                   Sells             Buys

                                        When a customer buys a stock from a firm acting as principal, the broker marks up the ask
                                        price to reach the net price to the customer. Likewise, when a customer sells stock to a firm
                                        acting as principal, the dealer marks down from the bid price to reach the net proceeds to the
                                        customer.

                                        Students are often confused by these terms, so let’s try to simplify. If you ever go to an auction
                                        (even on eBay), and you want to buy something, you turn in a bid. That is what you are
                                        willing to pay to buy the item. That is exactly what the market maker is doing. The firm is
                                        announcing to the investment world, “This is how much we are willing to pay to buy this
                                        stock from another FINRA member firm.”

                                        What about the ask price? Have you ever gone to a flea market or some other selling scene
                                        where the prices are not marked on the item? If you are interested in buying it, you will say,
                                        “How much are you asking for this?” That is what the market maker is saying: “We have this
                                        stock in our inventory and are asking $X for it.” The market maker could also say, “We are
                                        offering the stock at $X.” That is why the terms ask price and offer price are interchangeable.

                                        When a customer of a FINRA member firm enters an order to buy a stock, the firm has two
                                        ways of acting. If the firm acts as a principal (the dealer part of broker-dealer), it buys the
                                        stock from the market maker at the asking or offering price. Then, following the FINRA 5%
                                        policy (covered in Lesson 13.5), it adds a markup to its cost. Alternatively, it can act as an
                                        agent (the broker part of broker-dealer), and charge the customer the same price it paid plus a
                                        commission.

                                        If the customer enters a sell order, things work in reverse. The firm, acting as a principal,
                                        buys from the customer and sells to the market maker at the bid price. The price paid to
                                        the customer by the member firm is less than what it receives from the market maker. That
                                        difference is the markdown. The broker-dealer can also act in an agency capacity by crediting
                                        the customer with the market maker’s bid price, less a commission.

                                                     TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                     A broker-dealer can never charge a markup (or markdown) and a commission on the
                                                     same trade. One or the other, but never both.

                                                                                Unit 16   Types of Orders and Quotations     415


                                  EXAMPLE
                                  If the market maker in WXYZ is quoting 43.25 to 0.50, (short hand for 43.25 bid-43.50
                                  ask or offer), and the customer’s broker-dealer wants a half-point for the trade, a
                                  customer buying would pay 44 net, and a customer selling would receive 42.75 net.

                                                                                                                                       Unit 16
                                  The additional half-point (added to the ask or offer, or subtracted from the bid) is the
                                  firm’s markup and markdown, respectively. When you see the term net after a price, it
                                  means no commission (but there was a markup or markdown).


                       Types of Quotes
                       As mentioned earlier in the course, we refer to the OTC market as a negotiated market. As a
                       negotiated market where broker-dealers are trading with other broker-dealers, there are several
                       different types of quotes. We will review those most likely to appear on your exam.


                       Firm Quote
                       A firm quotation is the price at which a market maker stands ready to buy or sell at least one
                       trading unit—100 shares of stock or five bonds—at the quoted price with other member
                       firms. When a FINRA member firm makes a market in a security, the broker-dealer must be
                       willing to buy or sell at least one trading unit of the security at its firm quote. All quotes are
                       firm quotes unless otherwise indicated. In almost all cases, the quote size will be more than 1
                       round lot.

                                  EXAMPLE
                                  A market maker in ABCD common stock is quoting
                                      52.15 – 52-27, 4 × 6
                                  That means the bid is $52.15 and the ask is $52.27. At those prices, the dealer is willing
                                  to buy as many as 400 shares and sell as many as 600 shares. If a member calls to sell
                                  100 on behalf of its customer, the market maker will buy 100 at 52.15 and revise the
                                  quote to 52.15 – 52.27, 3 × 6 to reflect the fact that it has already purchased 100 shares.
                       One function of an employee of a broker-dealer is that of OTC trader. This individual is
                       responsible for taking customer orders received in the trading department and getting them
                       executed at the best possible price. This trader may attempt to negotiate a better price with a
                       market maker by making a counteroffer or a counterbid, especially if the spread between the
                       market maker’s bid and ask is fairly wide. However, the only way to guarantee an immediate
                       execution is to buy stock at the market maker’s ask price or sell at the bid price.

                       In a typical bond transaction, a trader at one broker-dealer (a market maker) calls a trader at
                       another to buy a specific bond. A market maker might give another broker-dealer a quote that
                       is firm for an hour with five-minute recall. This is a firm quote that remains good for an hour.
                       If, within that hour, the market maker receives another order for the same security, the trader
                       calls the broker-dealer back and gives it five minutes to confirm its order or lose its right to
                       buy that security at the price quoted. You might recall the term out-firm from Lesson 6.1.

                       On the exam, you may have to identify the language of a firm quote. Examples would be, “it
                       is 40 -41,” or “we are quoting 40 – 41.” The phrasing indicates that the quote is actual.

                                        Backing Away
                                        A market maker can revise a firm quote in response to market conditions and trading activity,
                                        but a market maker who refuses to do business at the price(s) quoted is backing away from the
                                        quote. Backing away is a violation of trading rules. If you see this on the exam, remember, it is
                                        a bad thing to back away from a firm quote.


                                        Subject Quote
                                        One could think of a subject quote as being the opposite of a firm quote. Whereas the
                                        firm quote represents the prices the dealer will honor, a subject quote requires further
                                        confirmation. It would be very rare to get a subject quote from a market maker. The most
                                        common case is when a customer calls her registered representative and asks, “How is ABCD
                                        doing today?” The representative could respond, “Last time I looked, it was 38 to a half,” or “I
                                        think it is about 38–38.50.” The statement is clear that the prices might have changed. As we
                                        showed you phraseology used to indicate a firm quote, the phrasing used to indicate a subject
                                        quote might be tested as well.


                                        Qualified Quotes
                                        A quote will often be given with qualifiers intended to allow the dealer to back away if market
                                        conditions change.


                                        Workout Quote
                                        The term workout quote is usually reserved for situations where a market maker knows that
                                        special handling will be required to accommodate a particular trade. Either the order size is
                                        too big for the market to absorb without disruption, or the market is too thin or temporarily
                                        unstable.

                                        A workout quote is an approximate figure used to provide the buyer or the seller with an
                                        indication of price, not a firm quote.

            “It is 40–41 subject.”
            “40–42.50 workout.”


                                        Nominal Quote
                                        A nominal quote is someone’s assessment of where a security might trade in an active market.
                                        Nominal quotes may be used to give customers an idea of the market value of an inactively
                                        traded security, but they are not firm quotes. Nominal quotes in print must be clearly labeled
                                        as such. These are common with municipal bonds (see Lesson 6.1) because the market for so
                                        many of them is very thin.

                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                  5.   A broker-dealer is looking for a Nasdaq security for a customer and calls a market
                                       maker for a quote and is told that the quote is 20,000 shares at $20.22 for the next 10
                                       minutes. What kind of quote would this be defined as?

                                                                                                                                       Unit 16
                                        A. Nominal
                                        B. Firm
                                        C. Workout
                                        D. Subject
                                       Answer: B. This quote is firm. The market maker has extended the quote with a
                                       given size, price, and time for how long the quote is good for. If the broker making
                                       the call decides to purchase the security in the next 10 minutes, the broker can buy
                                       20,000 shares at the designated price of $20.22. Why is the quote not two-sided (bid
                                       and ask)? Because we know the broker-dealer’s customer is interested in purchasing
                                       the security; only the asking price (and size) is necessary.


                       Quotation Spread
                       The difference between a security’s bid and offer (ask) price is known as the spread.


                       Spread Factors
                       Many factors influence a spread’s size, including
                        the issue’s size,
                        the issuer’s financial condition,
                        the amount of market activity in the issue, and
                        the market conditions.

                                  TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                  A phrase worth remembering is, “The more active a security, the narrower the spread.”
                                  The reverse would be true as well.


                       Best Execution of Customer Orders
                       In any transaction for or with a customer, a member must use reasonable diligence to find the
                       best market for the subject security. Once completed, the trade should be executed so that the
                       resultant price to the customer is as favorable as possible under prevailing market conditions.
                       FINRA Rule 5310 considers the following factors in determining whether a member has used
                       “reasonable diligence”:
                        The character of the market for the security (e.g., price, volatility, relative liquidity, and
                         pressure on available communications)
                        The size and type of transaction
                        The number of markets checked
                        Accessibility of the quotation
                        The terms and conditions of the order that result in the transaction, as communicated to
                         the member and persons associated with the member

                                        Orders Involving Securities With Limited Quotations or Pricing
                                        Information
                                        Although the best execution requirements in Rule 5310 apply to orders in all securities,
                                        markets for securities differ dramatically. One of the areas in which a member must be
                                        especially diligent in ensuring that it has met its best execution obligations is with respect
                                        to customer orders involving securities for which there is limited pricing information or
                                        quotations available. This is not an issue for stocks traded on the NYSE or the Nasdaq Stock
                                        Market. On the other hand, for stocks traded on the OTC Link, the pricing information is
                                        frequently quite limited. In addition, the specified security’s quotes or trades might not be
                                        shown for weeks at a time.

                                        Furthermore, when there is a quote, it is often from a single market maker. Without
                                        competition, it is just like a store selling something that no one else has—it can set the price
                                        wherever it wants. In these instances, a member should generally seek out other sources of
                                        pricing information or potential liquidity, which may include obtaining quotations from
                                        other sources (e.g., other firms that the member has traded that security with in the past).


                                        Interpositioning
                                        When acting in an agency capacity for a customer, a member firm cannot place a third party
                                        between itself and the best available market (members cannot route an order through another
                                        firm). They must go directly to the best available market (to a firm at the inside market). That
                                        is the practice of interpositioning.

                                        Generally, interpositioning results in a less-favorable price to the customer, as the third party
                                        will trade at the inside market and then add additional costs for itself.

                                                     TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                     The only time interpositioning can be justified is if it results in a better execution for
                                                     the customer. Better means a lower price than the inside offer or a higher price than
                                                     the inside bid.

                                                     assigned to execute customers’ orders cannot be considered justification for executing
                                                     away from the best available market. Channeling orders through a third party—as
                                                     described earlier—as reciprocation for service or business generated, cannot operate
                                                     to relieve a member of its obligations under this rule.

              LESSON 16.3: SHORT SALES

                         LO 16.c Define short sale strategies and requirements.



                         Introduction
                         The term short sale, or selling short, has been mentioned several times, but other than in the
                         glossary, no explanation has been given. As you may recall from the course introduction, we
                         have written our material primarily for those who have recently completed the SIE exam. For
                         those of you who are grandfathered, or those who don’t remember your SIE material, here is a
                         short (no pun intended) refresher on selling short.

                         Selling a security one does not own is known as being short or having a short position in the
                         securities. Unlike a long position, where the investor is bullish, a short seller is taking the view
                         that the price of the security will decline. This is a bearish strategy. A profit is made when
                         the short seller is able to replace the borrowed security at a price below that at which it was
                         initially sold.

                         The risk to a short seller is that the price of the borrowed security increases. This means the
                         price the seller will have to pay to replace it will be higher than the sale price. Because there is
                         theoretically no limit on how high a security’s price can go, the short seller has unlimited loss
                         potential. Purchasing the security to replace the borrowed one is known as covering the short
                         or closing the short position. Because short selling involves borrowing, all short sales must be
                         done in a margin account.


                         Short Sale Rules
                         A short sale involves the sale of a security that the customer does not own. To make delivery,
                         the broker-dealer lends the security to its customer. After settlement of the trade, the broker-
                         dealer credits the proceeds to the customer’s account. Short selling is the buy low-sell high
                         principle, but in reverse, where the sale is made before the purchase.
                         The short seller profits if the stock declines in value, but has a potentially unlimited loss if the
                         stock appreciates. The short seller ultimately has to replace the borrowed stock. There is no
                         limit as to how high the market price can reach. This is why selling a stock short is so risky.

                                    EXAMPLE
                                    A customer sells short 100 shares of ABC stock at $40 = $4,000. The broker-dealer lends
                                    the customer the shares so that delivery can be made to the purchaser. The customer
                                    owes the broker-dealer 100 shares of ABC stock.
                                    To profit, the stock must decline in value. The short seller buys the stock to replace the
                                    borrowed shares the customer sold. If the stock’s price declines to $25 per share, the
                                    customer will buy 100 shares of ABC stock at $25 = $2,500.
                                    The investor profits ($1,500) because the purchase price ($2,500) is less than the sale
                                    price ($4,000).

                                        If the price goes up, there is no limit to how high the price can go and, therefore, there is
                                        unlimited loss potential. On the other hand, the maximum profit is limited. The price of
                                        a security can never fall below worthless. That makes the maximum profit the difference
                                        between the sale price and $0.

                                        All short sales must be done in a short margin account, and the broker-dealer must make sure
                                        the customer who sells short understands the risk and that opening the account is suitable.
                                        Short sales may occur anytime during the trading day, including at the opening and closing
                                        of the day. The only requirement is that the broker-dealer has or is able to locate the shares to
                                        lend.

                                                     PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                     6.   A customer is interested in selling securities short. The most important disclosure to
                                                          the customer is that
                                                            A. the customer has unlimited financial risk.
                                                           B. the customer profits when the price of the stock goes up.
                                                           C. the safest securities to short are municipal securities.
                                                           D. the best time to sell short is in a bull market.
                                                          Answer: A. The most important disclosure when selling short is that if the stock goes
                                                          up instead of down, the customer is losing money. Theoretically, there is no limit to
                                                          how high the price can go before the position is closed. Therefore, the customer is
                                                          exposed to unlimited financial risk.


                                        Regulation SHO
                                        Regulation SHO mandates a locate requirement. That means that before the short sale of any
                                        equity security, firms must locate the securities for borrowing to ensure that delivery will be
                                        made on the settlement date. The regulators refer to this as affirmative determination. Not
                                        doing so is known as naked short selling and is not permitted.


                                        Insider Short Sale Regulations
                                        The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 prohibits directors, officers, and principal stockholders
                                        (insiders) from selling short stock in their own companies.


                                        Sell Order Tickets
                                        The SEC requires that all sell orders be identified as either long or short. No sale can be
                                        marked long unless the security to be delivered is in the customer’s account or is owned by the
                                        customer and will be delivered to the broker by the settlement date.

                                        A person is long a security if he
                                         has title to it,
                                         has purchased the security or has entered into an unconditional contract to purchase the
                                          security but has not yet received it,
                                         owns a security convertible into or exchangeable for the security and has tendered such
                                          security for conversion or exchange, or
                                         has an option to purchase the security and has exercised that option.

                                                                                Unit 16   Types of Orders and Quotations     421


                       Unless one or more of these conditions are met, the SEC considers any sale of securities a
                       short sale.

                                  TAKE NOTE
                                  When a customer is both long and short shares of the same stock simultaneously, the
                                                                                                                                       Unit 16
                                  positions must be netted out to determine if the customer is net long or net short.
                                  For example, if a customer is long 500 shares of XYZ and short 200 shares of XYZ, the
                                  net position is long 300 shares. In this case, if the customer wished to sell 400 shares
                                  of XYZ, the sell order ticket must read “SELL 300 shares long and 100 shares short,”
                                  because the customer is only long 300 shares (net).


                       Borrowing Securities
                       Investors cannot sell short if they are not able to borrow the security they are selling. Securities
                       can be borrowed from
                        the member firm executing the short sale on behalf of the customer;
                        margin customers of that member firm;
                        other member firms; and
                        institutional investors, such as pension plans and custodial banks.
                       When opening a margin account, customers often sign a loan consent agreement that allows
                       custodians to lend customer margin securities from the portfolio. Certain sophisticated inves­
                       tors and institutional customers, such as pension funds, lend securities (this is especially use­ful
                       for hard-to-find-securities) to generate additional income in their portfolios by charging for
                       the loan.


                       Mark to Market
                       Mark to market, sometimes called marking to the market, is simply making daily adjustments
                       to the customer’s margin account as the price of the underlying security changes. In a short
                       position where the stock’s price increases, the equity in the account goes down. Of course,
                       when the price of the short security drops, the effect on the account’s equity is positive.
                       Remember, short sellers profit when the price of the stock goes down.


                       Shorting Bonds
                       Some securities, such as listed stocks, have many equivalent securities trading at any time.
                       For instance, it is easy to short 100 shares of an NYSE listed stock because an equivalent 100
                       shares of that stock can be purchased on the NYSE at any time. It is not easy to cover shorts
                       for most municipal bonds because the limited number of bonds available in each issue could
                       make it difficult to buy back the short position. In other words, the municipal market is too
                       thin.

                                  TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                  You may be required to know that short selling municipal bonds is almost never done.

           LESSON 16.4: EXTENSION OF CREDIT IN THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY

                                        LO 16.d Compute margin requirements.



                                        Introduction
                                        Margin accounts allow investors to leverage their investment dollars. Through margin
                                        accounts, investors can borrow money through brokerage firms by pledging securities as
                                        collateral. The Federal Reserve Board regulates margin transactions.

                                        FINRA member firms are required to impose initial and maintenance requirements on all
                                        margin accounts. They must mark to market all positions daily to ensure account equity meets
                                        the minimum requirements.

                                        Although this unit involves substantial calculation and accounting scenarios, students
                                        should expect that only about one-third to one-half of the margin test questions involve
                                        computations, with the rest dealing with concepts.


                                        Types of Margin Accounts
                                        There are two types of margin accounts: long and short. In a long margin account, customers
                                        purchase securities and pay interest on the money borrowed until the loan is repaid. In a
                                        short margin account, the stock is borrowed and then sold short, enabling the customer to
                                        profit if its value declines. All short sales must be executed through and accounted for in a
                                        margin account.

                                        In long margin accounts, customers borrow money; in short margin accounts, customers
                                        borrow securities.

                                        Advantages of margin accounts for customers are that they can
                                         purchase more securities with a lower initial cash outlay and
                                         leverage the investment by borrowing a portion of the purchase price.
                                        Leveraging magnifies the customer’s rate of return, or rate of loss in adverse market
                                        conditions.

                                     The advantages of margin accounts for broker-dealers are
                                      margin account loans generate interest income for the firm and
                                      margin customers typically trade larger positions because of increased trading capital,
                                       generating higher commissions for the firm.


                                     Margin Account Agreements
                                     Customers who open margin accounts must sign a margin agreement before trading can
                                     begin. The agreement consists of three parts: the credit agreement, the hypothecation
                                     agreement, and the loan consent form.


                                     Credit Agreement
                                     The credit agreement discloses the terms of the credit extended by the broker-dealer,
                                     including the method of interest computation and situations under which interest rates may
                                     change.


                                     Hypothecation Agreement
                                     The hypothecation agreement gives permission to the broker-dealer to pledge customer
                                     margin securities as collateral. The firm hypothecates customer securities to the bank, and
                                     the bank loans money to the broker-dealer on the basis of the loan value of these securities.
                                     All customer securities must be held in street name (registered in the name of the firm) to
                                     facilitate this process. When customer securities are held in street name, the broker-dealer
                                     is known as the nominal, or named, owner. The customer is the beneficial owner, because he
                                     retains all rights of ownership.

                                     After customers pledge their securities to the broker-dealer by signing the hypothecation
                                     agreement, the broker-dealer rehypothecates (repledges) them as collateral for a loan from the
                                     bank. Regulation U oversees the process when a bank lends money to a broker-dealer based
                                     on customer securities that have been pledged as collateral.

                                     Broker-dealers are limited to pledging 140% of a customer’s debit balance as collateral. Any
                                     customer securities in excess of this amount must be physically segregated. The firm cannot
                                     commingle customer securities with securities owned by the firm.

                                        Firms can only commingle one customer’s securities with another customer’s securities for
                                        hypothecation if customers have given specific permission by signing the hypothecation
                                        agreement.

                                        Loan Consent Form
                                        If signed, the loan consent form gives permission to the firm to lend out customer margin
                                        securities to other customers or broker-dealers, usually for short sales.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     It is mandatory that the customer sign the credit agreement and hypothecation
                                                     agreement. The loan consent form is optional.

                                        Risk Disclosure
                                        Before or at the time of opening a margin account, a member firm must provide customers
                                        with a margin disclosure statement. This information must also be provided to margin
                                        customers on an annual basis. The document discusses the risks associated with margin
                                        trading, some of which follow:
                                         Customers can lose more money that initially deposited.
                                         Customers are not entitled to choose which securities or other assets in their account(s)
                                          are liquidated or sold to meet a call for additional funds.
                                         Customers are not entitled to an extension of time to meet a margin call.
                                         Firms can increase their in-house margin requirements without advance notice.

                                                                                                                                                 Unit 16
               Credit Agreement           Discloses the terms under which credit is extended, including the use of the client’s
                                          securities as collateral for the margin loan. SEC Rule 10b-16 requires firms to disclose the
                                          method of computing interest and the conditions under which interest rates and charges
                                          will be changed. Firms must send customers an assurance that statements accounting for
                                          interest charges will be sent with the same frequency that interest is charged (monthly or
                                          quarterly).
               Hypothecation Agreement    Gives the firm permission to pledge (hypothecate) securities held on margin to a lending
                                          institution; a mandatory part of a margin agreement.
               Loan Consent (optional)    Gives the firm permission to lend securities held in the margin account to other brokers,
                                          usually for short sales. It is not mandatory for customers to sign the loan consent
                                          agreement.
               Margin Disclosure          FINRA Rule 2264 requires a margin disclosure statement be furnished before or at the time
               Statement                  of opening a margin account. The document focuses on the risks of margin trading.


                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                              8.   To open a margin account, it is mandatory that the customer sign
                                                    A. the credit agreement and the loan consent agreement.
                                                    B. the credit agreement and hypothecation agreement.
                                                    C. the hypothecation agreement and the loan consent agreement.
                                                    D. the credit agreement, the hypothecation agreement, and the margin
                                                        disclosure statement.
                                                   Answer: B. Only the credit and hypothecation agreement must be signed. The loan
                                                   consent agreement is optional and there is no signature on the margin disclosure
                                                   statement.


                                    Regulation T
                                    The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 gives the Federal Reserve Board the authority to regulate
                                    the extension of credit in the securities industry. For margin accounts, Regulation T states
                                    that customers must deposit a minimum of 50% of the price of the transaction within two
                                    additional business days of regular way settlement (T+2 for most securities). This is sometimes
                                    expressed as S+2, (settlement plus 2). Therefore, the deposit must be done within four
                                    business days of the transaction.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              The Regulation T time limit applies to both cash and margin accounts. Customers
                                              have two business days after settlement to make their required payment, regardless
                                              of the account type. Broker-dealers expect their customers will pay on the settlement
                                              date. The industry views the Regulation T rule as a two-day cushion.


                                    Marginable Securities
                                    Regulation T also identifies which securities are eligible for purchase on margin and which
                                    may be used as collateral for loans for other purchases.

                                                          margin account.
                                                         Marginable refers to securities that can be purchased on margin and can be used
                                                          as collateral in a margin account.
                                        The following should be helpful in keeping things in order.

            May be purchased on margin and used as collateral:
            ■ Exchange-listed stocks, bonds
            ■ Nasdaq stocks
            ■ Non-Nasdaq OTC issues approved by the Federal Reserve Board
            ■ Warrants
            Cannot be purchased on margin and cannot be used as collateral:
            ■ Put and call options
            ■ Rights
            ■ Non-Nasdaq OTC issues not approved by the Federal Reserve Board
            ■ Insurance contracts
            Cannot be bought on margin but can be used as collateral after 30 days:
            ■ Mutual funds
            ■ New issues


                                        Deadlines for Meeting Margin Calls
                                        As previously discussed, Regulation T requires margin account customers to meet initial
                                        margin deposit requirements no more than two business days after the settlement date. The
                                        deposit may be made in cash or in fully paid marginable securities valued at twice (200%) the
                                        amount of the Regulation T cash call. We will show you shortly where that number comes
                                        from.

                                        If payment is late, the broker-dealer may apply to its designated examining authority (DEA)
                                        for an extension. The DEA for a broker-dealer can be either FINRA, an exchange, or, in some
                                        cases, the Federal Reserve Bank. For introducing broker-dealers, (those who do not clear their
                                        own trades), the request is made by the firm that does their clearing (back-office work).

                                        A broker-dealer may, at its option, disregard any sum due from the customer not exceeding
                                        $1,000. That does not mean the firm ignores the debt. It means the sell out and freeze
                                        described in the next paragraph does not have to take place.

                                        If no extension is received by the morning of the third business day after the settlement date
                                        (one day after the deposit must be made), the firm must sell out the securities purchased
                                        and freeze the account for 90 days. If the customer wants to purchase securities in a frozen
                                        account, the customer must have full payment in the account before order entry.

                                        Freeriding is a term used when securities are purchased and then sold without making
                                        payment for the purchase on settlement date. Freeriding is generally prohibited in both
                                        cash and margin accounts. As a penalty, the account will be frozen for 90 days and no new
                                        transactions can occur unless there is cash or marginable securities in the account before the
                                        purchase is made.

                                 EXAMPLE
                                 An example of freeriding is a customer buying 100 shares of ABC at 25 on Monday and
                                 then selling it on Tuesday at 27. Instead of settling the trade on Wednesday (T+2) with
                                 a $2,500 deposit, the customer tells the broker-dealer to use the $2,700 that will be

                                                                                                                                     Unit 16
                                 coming in on Thursday and credit the account with the $200 profit. Although the client
                                 is entitled to that profit, the account will be frozen because the purchase was not paid
                                 for before the sale.
                                 What about day traders? They buy and sell on the same day. There are two ways to
                                 avoid the freeze:
                                     They can have sufficient funds in their account before making the trade.
                                     “Swap” checks on settlement date. That is, pay the broker-dealer and then receive
                                      payment for the sale.

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 9.   When a client’s cash account is frozen, the client
                                       A. must deposit the full purchase price no later than the settlement date for a
                                          purchase.
                                       B. must deposit the full purchase price before a purchase order may be executed.
                                       C. may make sales with the firm’s permission.
                                       D. may not trade under any circumstances.
                                      Answer: B. When an account is frozen, funds equal to the full purchase price must
                                      be in the client’s account before a broker-dealer can accept any buy orders.


                       Exempt Securities
                       Certain securities are exempt from Regulation T margin requirements. When purchased in a
                       margin account, they are subject to the firm’s determination of an initial requirement. Firms
                       must follow maintenance requirements established by FINRA or their SRO rules. Other than
                       knowing which securities are exempt, it is unlikely you will be asked anything else about
                       them.
                       Securities exempt from Regulation T include
                        U.S. Treasury bills, notes, and bonds;
                        government agency issues; and
                        municipal securities.


                       Initial Requirements
                       Customers are required to deposit a minimum amount of equity for their first purchase in
                       a margin account. Although Regulation T states that a deposit of 50% of the market value
                       of the purchase is required, FINRA rules require that this initial deposit cannot be less than
                       $2,000, unless paid in full.

           Figure 16.10: Initial Requirements Example
                                              Regulation T            FINRA    Customer Deposit
            Customer Purchase
                                              Requirement         Minimum Rule     Required
            100 shares at $50/share              $2,500               $2,000               $2,500
            100 shares at $30/share              $1,500               $2,000               $2,000
            100 shares at $15/share                $750               $1,500               $1,500

                                        The customer must deposit the greater of the Regulation T requirement or the FINRA
                                        minimum. The exception occurs when the customer’s initial purchase is less than $2,000; the
                                        customer is not required to deposit $2,000, only the full purchase price.

                                        There is another way to look at this: if the customer’s first purchase in a margin account is less
                                        than $2,000, deposit 100% of the purchase price. If the first purchase is between $2,000 and
                                        $4,000, deposit $2,000. If the first purchase is greater than $4,000, deposit 50%.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     The FINRA minimum rule also applies to short margin accounts. However, because
                                                     short transactions are more speculative, the minimum of $2,000 is never waived. If a
                                                     short sale margin requirement is less than $2,000, the required deposit is still $2,000.
                                                     For example, a short sale of 100 shares of XYZ at $18 per share would require a $2,000
                                                     deposit. On the other hand, a purchase of 100 shares of XYZ at $18 per share would
                                                     requires $1,800 (full payment). Note that we are only talking about initial transactions.
                                                     As we go on in this lesson, you will see that things can be different in an established
                                                     margin account.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     The Federal Reserve Board can change Regulation T, but the current requirement
                                                     has been in place since January 1, 1974. Assume Regulation T equals 50% in test
                                                     questions.

                                                     PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                     10. An investor opens a new margin account and buys 200 shares of DWQ at 50, with
                                                         Regulation T at 50%. What is the investor’s initial margin requirement?
                                                          A. $2,500
                                                          B. $3,000
                                                          C. $5,000
                                                          D. $10,000
                                                          Answer: C. The initial margin requirement is calculated by multiplying the market
                                                          value of $10,000 by the Regulation T requirement of 50%, which equals $5,000.


                                        Margin Accounting
                                        For active margin accounts, broker-dealers must verify that equity in the account still meets
                                        minimum requirements following fluctuations in market value.

                                        The practice of recalculation to check the status of the equity in the account is called marking
                                        to the market. It is typically done every business day on the basis of the closing price of the
                                        stock. This concept applies to both long and short margin accounts, which will be discussed
                                        separately.

                       Long Margin Accounting (The Customer Owns the Security)
                       The exam uses the following terms to describe activity in long margin accounts:
                        Long market value (LMV). The current market value of the stock position the investor

                                                                                                                                   Unit 16
                         purchased.
                        Debit register (DR). The amount of money borrowed by the customer.
                        Equity (EQ). The customer’s net worth in the margin account; it represents the portion of
                         the securities the customer fully owns.

                       The amount of equity in the account is determined by this equation:

                            LMV – DR = EQ

                       To simplify long margin accounts, think of them as a house with a mortgage. If the market
                       value of a house goes up or down, the mortgage amount does not change, but the equity goes
                       up or down. The same is true in a margin account; when the market value of securities goes
                       up, the debit balance (what the customer owes the broker-dealer) stays the same, while the
                       equity increases. When market value of securities goes down, the debit balance stays the same
                       and the equity decreases.

                       Continuing the analogy, consider a house payment. The payment does not affect the market
                       value of the house, but reduces the debit balance and consequently increases the equity.
                       When money is paid into a margin account, the debit balance is decreased, and the equity is
                       increased.


                       Analyzing Long Margin Accounts
                       To analyze long margin account activity, a simplified balance sheet will be used, as shown as
                       follows. The LMV is an asset, the DR is a liability, and the difference between them is the
                       equity.

                             LMV       DR

                                 Draw a chart whenever you are asked to compute equity in a margin account.
                                 Remember the master margin account equation: LMV – DR = EQ. Be sure that your
                                 account is balanced before going to the next step.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     A customer purchases 1,000 shares of XYZ at 60 on margin and borrows the maximum
                                                     50% from the broker-dealer.
                                                     The margin chart is set up as follows:

                                                      LMV           DR
                                                      60,000        30,000


                                                                    EQ
                                                                    30,000
                                                     In this instance, the customer must deposit $30,000 (50% of $60,000). The customer
                                                     may deposit cash or fully paid securities. Meeting the margin requirement in securities
                                                     requires double the necessary cash margin when Regulation T is 50%. For a margin
                                                     requirement of $30,000, the customer may pay $30,000 in cash, or deposit $60,000 of
                                                     fully paid securities to meet the Regulation T requirement.
                                        Earlier, we said we would explain where the 200% deposit came from. In the earlier example,
                                        we stated that the margin requirement could be met by double the cash requirement
                                        (200%). In this example, instead of depositing $30,000 cash, the client could have deposited
                                        $60,000 in fully paid marginable securities. Before we go the chart to prove that, we need to
                                        understand the concept.

                                        We continuously state that Regulation T requires a 50% deposit when buying (or selling
                                        short) on margin. Well, that is correct, but not really what Regulation T says. The regulation
                                        assigns a loan value to securities. In the case of the stocks we will be dealing with, that loan
                                        value is 50%. That means that a customer walking into a brokerage office with marginable
                                        stock worth $20,000 can borrow $10,000 by leaving that stock as collateral (hypothecating).
                                        The customer can walk out with a check for the money or can have it put into a special
                                        memorandum account (SMA) where it can be withdrawn later.

                                        Suppose a customer purchases $20,000 worth of stock in a margin account, but has no
                                        money. The cash call would be for $10,000. As we just described, if the customer has $20,000
                                        of stock, it can be deposited into the account. The broker-dealer can lend $10,000—exactly
                                        what is needed for the call. What does that look like on our balance sheet?

                                                LMV            DR
                                                20,000         20,000
                                                20,000
                                                               EQ
                                                               20,000

                                        The first $20,000 is the stock purchased. The second $20,000 is the stock deposited. Because
                                        there was no cash paid by the customer, the entire $20,000 is borrowed money making, the
                                        DR $20,000. That leave us $20,000 of equity, and that happens to be exactly the amount of
                                        fully paid stock deposited.

                                        The takeaway here is that any margin requirement can be met with marginable stock worth
                                        twice (200%) the amount of the call.

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 11. A margin account is restricted by $2,000. Which of the following actions may the
                                     customer take to bring the account to the Regulation T requirement?
                                      A. Withdraw $2,000 of SMA

                                                                                                                                     Unit 16
                                      B. Deposit $1,000 cash
                                      C. Deposit $4,000 of fully paid marginable stock
                                      D. Deposit $2,000 of fully paid marginable stock
                                      Answer: C. Keep it simple. Saying the account is restricted is just to make it seem
                                      more difficult. The question asks how to get the account off restriction? The customer
                                      needs $2,000 in cash to do so. However, there is no answer of $2,000. We just learned
                                      another way to get money—deposit fully paid marginable securities. How much? The
                                      deposit should be 200% or twice the amount of cash needed. That would be $2,000 ×
                                      2, or $4,000.

                       When the market value of securities changes, the broker-dealer must mark to market the
                       positions to ensure that enough equity remains in the account. The customer’s account must
                       always meet the maintenance requirement of FINRA. In a long margin account, minimum
                       maintenance is 25% of the LMV.
                       Marking to the market identifies the status of the customer’s account. The determination of
                       the status requires the computation of two benchmarks:
                        Regulation T (50% of LMV)
                        Minimum maintenance (25% of LMV)
                       Using the previous example, if XYZ declines to 50, we compute both of these benchmarks
                       based on the new market value of the account, as shown as follows:

                             LMV         DR
                                         30,000
                             60,000
                             50,000
                                         EQ
                                         30,000
                                         20,000

                       Regulation T = 25,000 (50% × 50,000). This account is restricted (see next topic).

                       Minimum maintenance required = 12,500 (25% × 50,000). This account is well above the
                       minimum maintenance level.

                       Here are some helpful tips in long margin accounting:
                        When the market value of securities goes up or down, the DR does not change.
                        When marking to the market, the calculation of Regulation T and minimum
                         maintenance is based on the new LMV.


                       Restricted Accounts
                       If the equity in the account is less than the Regulation T requirement but greater than or
                       equal to the minimum maintenance requirement, the account is restricted. We saw an
                       example of that on the previous chart.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     If an account becomes restricted, there is no requirement for the customer to take any
                                                     action to remove the account from the restricted status. A maintenance call will be
                                                     sent only if the account falls below the minimum maintenance requirement.


                                        Restricted Account Rules
                                        If an account is restricted, the following rules apply.
                                         To purchase additional securities, put up 50%.
                                         To withdraw securities from the account, the customer must deposit cash equal to 50% of
                                          the value of the securities to be withdrawn.
                                         If securities are sold in a restricted account, at least half the proceeds must be retained in
                                          the account to reduce the debit balance. This is called the retention requirement. Also,
                                          50% of the proceeds are credited to SMA.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     SMA is used much like a line of credit with a bank. SMA preserves the customer’s right
                                                     to use excess equity (discussed later in the unit.) Please also note that even though we
                                                     are referring to an account, in practice and on the exam, it is always referred to simply
                                                     as SMA, not an SMA.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     Let’s go back to our earlier example. After the purchase at $60 per share, the value has
                                                     dropped to $50 per share. That makes our numbers:
                                                          LMV $50,000; DR $30,000; EQ $20,000
                                                     This account is restricted by $5,000 because 50% of the LMV is $25,000 and the
                                                     account’s equity is only $20,000.
                                                     The customer contacts the firm to state that she wants to sell $10,000 worth of stock.
                                                     Initially, the firm applies all of the proceeds against the debit balance and credits SMA
                                                     with $5,000. Her account now looks as follows:
                                                          LMV $40,000; DR $20,000; EQ $20,000; SMA $5,000
                                                     What if the customer wishes to withdraw some of the proceeds of the $10,000 sale
                                                     instead of leaving it all in the account? Because the account is restricted, automatically
                                                     50% of the proceeds go to reduce the debit balance. That would mean $5,000 to
                                                     reduce the DR and the other $5,000 to the customer. That would make the account
                                                     look like this:
                                                          LMV $40,000; DR $25,000; EQ $15,000; SMA 0
                                                     Why is the SMA zero? Remember, it was created because all $10,000 was retained in
                                                     the account to reduce the debit balance. 50% of that $10,000 was put into SMA as
                                                     money that could be withdrawn in the future. In this example, the SMA was initially
                                                     created based on retaining all of the proceeds. When the customer changes her mind,
                                                     from a margin accounting standpoint, the 50% she takes out comes from that SMA.
                                                     The reason all the proceeds of the sale are initially applied against the debit balance is
                                                     this. What if the customer does not want any of the proceeds to be sent to herself? In
                                                     this case, the firm has the obligation to reduce the debit and thus her interest charges.

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 12. If securities are sold in a restricted account, which of the following is not affected?
                                       A. LMV
                                       B. DR

                                                                                                                                       Unit 16
                                       C. EQ
                                       D. SMA
                                      Answer: C. All but equity are affected. Equity is affected only if the customer elects to
                                      remove a portion of the proceeds.


                       Maintenance Requirements
                       When the equity in the account falls below the minimum maintenance requirement, the
                       customer receives a maintenance margin call. Maintenance calls are a demand that the
                       customer make a payment to bring the account back to minimum. Failure to meet the call
                       immediately requires the broker-dealer to liquidate enough securities in the account to bring
                       the account back to minimum. There are two ways to meet the margin maintenance call:
                        Depositing cash
                        Fully paid marginable securities

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 A firm can impose a maintenance level higher than the FINRA minimum maintenance
                                 rule levels. This is a house minimum. Many firms today impose 30%–35% minimum
                                 maintenance requirements.

                                 TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                 It is critical to remember that Regulation T imposes margin requirements for new
                                 securities transactions and for withdrawals of cash or other collateral. Regulation
                                 T does not otherwise establish any requirements relating to the amount of margin
                                 that must be maintained in a customer’s account after it has bought (or sold short)
                                 one or more securities. The rules on maintenance equity are solely those of the self-
                                 regulatory organizations (SROs).
                       Consider the previous example we have been working with. By evaluating the amount of
                       equity in the account relative to the Regulation T and minimum maintenance benchmarks, it
                       can be determined that the account is in restricted status.

                       The new equity of $20,000 is less than the Regulation T requirement of $25,000, but more
                       than the minimum maintenance of $12,500.

                             LMV         DR
                                         30,000

                                         20,000

                            Regulation T = 25,000 (50% × 50,000)

                            minimum maintenance = 12,500 (25% × 50,000)

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     When calculating the equity in a margin account using a T-chart, be sure to follow
                                                     these steps:
                                                         Calculate the equity after a market value change: LMV – DR = EQ.
                                                         Calculate the new Regulation T: 50% of the new LMV.
                                                         Calculate the new minimum maintenance: 25% of the new LMV.


                                        Maintenance Call
                                        Assume that the market value of the securities falls from $50,000 to $36,000. To find the
                                        status of the account, the chart would be adjusted as follows:

                                                LMV           DR
                                                              30,000
                                                50,000
                                                36,000
                                                              EQ
                                                              20,000
                                                              6,000

                                               Regulation T level = 18,000 (50% × 36.000)

                                               minimum maintenance requirement = 9,000 (25% × 36,000)

                                        Note the adjustment to the LMV. The LMV has fallen to $36,000, so the EQ must be
                                        changed to $6,000 ($36,000 – $30,000 = $6,000). After adjusting EQ in the account, the
                                        new Regulation T and minimum maintenance levels are calculated. (Regulation T = 50% of
                                        $36,000, or $18,000; minimum maintenance = 25% of $36,000, or $9,000).

                                        This account is subject to a maintenance call because the equity is below the minimum
                                        requirement by $3,000 ($9,000 required – $6,000 actual). If the call is not met promptly, the
                                        broker-dealer will liquidate securities in the customer’s account as needed.

                                        A formula can be applied to calculate the market value to which securities can fall before there
                                        is a maintenance call. This formula is known as the market value at maintenance formula
                                        and is calculated as follows:

                                               DR ÷ 0.75

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     A customer buys $90,000 worth of stock on margin and meets the initial Regulation T
                                                     requirement by depositing $45,000. The debit balance is $45,000. To what level would
                                                     the market value have to fall in order for the account to be at minimum maintenance?
                                                     Divide the debit balance of $45,000 by 0.75, which results in a maintenance market
                                                     value of $60,000. If the market value does fall to $60,000, the account will look like
                                                     this: LMV $60,000; DR $45,000; EQ $15,000. At this point, the account is exactly at 25%
                                                     equity.
                                                     As with most computations, there is more than one way to do this. For some, it is more
                                                     comfortable to multiply the debit balance times 4/3 (or 11/3). It will still come out to
                                                     $60,000.

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 If an account falls below the minimum, the broker-dealer sends a maintenance call
                                 demanding an amount sufficient to bring the account back to the minimum.


                                                                                                                                       Unit 16
                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 13. A customer has a long margin account with a market value of $12,000 and a debit
                                     balance of $10,000. The customer would receive a maintenance call for
                                      A. $0 because the account meets the minimum equity requirement of $2,000.
                                      B. $1,000.
                                      C. $2,000.
                                      D. $4,000.
                                      Answer: B. The equity in the account is $2,000, which is approximately 16% of
                                      the market value, ($2,000 divided by $12,000). To bring the account back to the
                                      minimum, which is $3,000 (25% × $12,000), the customer will receive a maintenance
                                      call for $1,000. After meeting the call, the account will look like this: LMV $12,000; DR
                                      $9,000; EQ $3,000.


                       Excess Equity and the SMA
                       Excess equity (EE) in a margin account is the amount of equity exceeding the Regulation T
                       requirement.

                       To illustrate, return to the example account:

                             LMV         DR
                             60,000      30,000



                                         EQ
                                         30,000

                       Assume that the market value of the securities increases to $80,000. After marking to the
                       market, the account appears as follows:

                             LMV         DR
                                         30,000       (2) SMA = 10,000

                             60,000
                             80,000
                                         EQ

                                         30,000       (1) EE = 10,000
                                         50,000

                            Regulation T = 40,000 (50% × 80,000)

                            minimum maintenance = 20,000 (25% × 80,000)

                       The increase in market value creates equity of $50,000 because the DR does not change.
                       The new Regulation T requirement is $40,000 (50% of $80,000), and the new minimum
                       maintenance is $20,000 (25% of $80,000). Because the equity exceeds Regulation T, this
                       account has EE of $10,000 ($50,000 – $40,000 = $10,000).

                                        In the example, (1) refers to the excess equity and (2) refers to the SMA, which we are now
                                        going to discuss.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     A rule to determine SMA is as follows: for every $1 increase in market value, $0.50 of
                                                     SMA is created. In the previous example, market value increased by $20,000, which
                                                     created SMA of $10,000.
                                        EE creates SMA, or buying power, in the account.

                                        SMA is a line of credit that a customer can borrow from or use to purchase securities.

                                        It is perhaps the most complicated margin concept. The house analogy can also help simplify
                                        SMA. Assume that a house has increased substantially in value. Homeowners with large
                                        amounts of equity sometimes borrow against their equity through home equity loans. When
                                        they take a loan, the amount they owe on their house is more than before, and the equity falls.
                                        SMA is like a home equity loan. It is created because of increased equity in the account and
                                        is an additional line of credit. When the SMA line of credit is used, the debit balance in the
                                        customer’s account is increased and the equity falls.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     The amount of SMA in the account is equal to the greater of the EE or the amount
                                                     already in SMA.
                                        Until this transaction, our example account had no EE. The EE of $10,000 generated SMA of
                                        $10,000.

                                        What happens to the SMA if the market value of the securities falls? The following example
                                        depicts the market value falling to $70,000:

                                                LMV          DR
                                                80,000       30,000     (2) SMA = 10,000
                                                70,000


                                                             EQ

                                                             50,000     (1) EE = 5,000
                                                             40,000     10,000

                                               Regulation T = 35,000 (50% × 70,000)

                                               minimum maintenance = 17,500 (25% × 70,000)

                                        The decrease in market value creates equity of $40,000. The new Regulation T requirement
                                        is $35,000 (50% of $70,000), and the new minimum maintenance is $17,500 (25% of
                                        $70,000). Because the equity exceeds Regulation T, this account has EE of $5,000 ($40,000 –
                                        $35,000 = $5,000).

                                        What is the new SMA amount? Regulation T states that the SMA amount is equal to the
                                        greater of the EE or the SMA already in the account. Because the SMA of $10,000 is greater
                                        than the EE of $5,000, the SMA remains at $10,000. In summary, remember that although
                                        SMA increases when the market value in the account increases, it does not decrease as a result
                                        of a market value decline.

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 SMA may be more than EE and may exist even if there is no EE in the account.

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 Although the SMA is not reduced by a decline in market value, there is a certain                   Unit 16
                                 condition where it cannot be used. SMA can always be used in a restricted account, as
                                 long as its use does not bring the account below the minimum maintenance level.
                       The following is one last example in calculating the SMA balance. Assuming the market value
                       of securities rises to $100,000, what is the new SMA balance?

                             LMV           DR
                             70,000        30,000      (2) SMA = 10,000
                             100,000                   20,000

                                           EQ
                                           40,000      (1) EE = 5,000
                                           70,000      20,000

                            Regulation T = 50,000 (50% × 100,000)

                            minimum maintenance = 25,000 (25% × 100,000)

                       The increase in market value creates equity of $70,000. The new Regulation T requirement
                       is $50,000 (50% of $100,000), and the new minimum maintenance is $25,000 (25%
                       of $100,000). Because the equity exceeds Regulation T, this account has EE of $20,000
                       ($70,000 – $50,000 = $20,000). This affects the amount of SMA. The SMA rule explains that
                       the SMA amount is equal to the greater of the EE or the SMA already in the account. Because
                       the EE of $20,000 is greater than the existing SMA of $10,000, the SMA balance becomes
                       $20,000.

                       We have shown you that SMA is increased by EE from market value increases. Any of the
                       following also generate SMA:
                        Nonrequired cash deposits. If a customer deposits cash that is not required to meet a margin
                         call, the full amount reduces the debit and is also credited to SMA.
                        Dividends. Dividends received on securities in the margin account are added to SMA. The
                         customer can withdraw these income distributions, even if the account is restricted.

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 Customers wishing to remove cash dividends coming into their margin accounts must
                                 do so within 30 days of receipt. Otherwise, the cash dividend is applied against the
                                 debit balance, thereby increasing the equity in the account.

                        Loan value. If a customer makes a nonrequired deposit of marginable stock, the stock’s
                         loan value is credited to SMA. Because the loan value is 50% of the current market value,
                         the credit is equal to half what would be gained by a deposit of an equal amount of cash.
                        Sale of stock. When stock is sold, 50% of the sales proceeds is credited to SMA.


                       Using SMA
                       SMA is a line of credit; therefore, the investor can use it to withdraw cash or meet the margin
                       requirement on stock purchases.

                                        The customer can withdraw cash by borrowing against the credit line of $20,000, which will
                                        increase the debit balance by $20,000. If the full $20,000 is withdrawn, the account will

                                        The use of $20,000 of SMA reduces the SMA balance to zero. The debit balance is increased
                                        to $50,000, because SMA is a loan. The equity balance falls to $20,000, and the account is in
                                        restricted status. The customer can use SMA as long as it does not cause a maintenance call.

                                        SMA can be used when the account has EE or is in restricted status. SMA can also be used
                                        to meet the initial margin requirements on stock purchases. SMA gives the investor buying
                                        power. Assume a margin account appears as follows:

                                        The SMA of $20,000, when used as the margin requirement, allows the customer to purchase
                                        $40,000 of stock. In other words, for every $1 of SMA, the customer can purchase $2 of

                      stock. SMA has a buying power of 2:1. After the purchase of $40,000, the account appears as

                      The $40,000 purchase was paid for by a debit balance increase of $40,000. Anytime SMA is
                      used to buy stock, the debit balance increases by the full amount of the purchase.

                      The use of SMA to meet the purchase price is like borrowing on a credit card. The customer
                      owes more money. This account is in restricted status after the purchase of $40,000 of stock
                      because the equity in the account is less than the Regulation T level of $55,000.

                                TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                Here is a quick review of critical long margin account concepts:
                                     The first transaction in a margin account requires a deposit of the greater of 50%
                                      of the LMV or $2,000. The $2,000 minimum is waived if 100% of the transaction is
                                      less than $2,000 [e.g., 100 shares at $15 requires $1,500 (full payment)].
                                     The basic margin equation is: LMV – DR = EQ.
                                     Regulation T = 50% of the LMV.
                                     Minimum maintenance = 25% of the LMV (SRO rules).

                                     Utilizing SMA increases the debit balance.
                                     The buying power of SMA is 2:1.

                                                          Answer: D. The sale of securities in the account results in an automatic release of
                                                          funds to SMA. Nonrequired cash deposits, such as interest and dividends, are also
                                                          automatically credited to SMA. An increase in the value of the securities will increase
                                                          SMA if the EE becomes greater than the existing SMA. A decrease in the market value
                                                          of the securities will not increase or decrease SMA in a long margin account. It will,
                                                          however, increase the SMA in a short margin account.

                                        Pattern Day Traders
                                        A day trader is someone who buys and sells the same security on the same day to try to take
                                        advantage of intraday price movements. A pattern day trader is someone who executes four
                                        or more day trades in a five-business-day period.

                                        We are not hearing anything about this on the exam, but, because it is in FINRA’s content
                                        outline, we are presenting you with the basics. If we hear of any new information, it will be
                                        posted in Exam Tips and Content Updates.

                                        The minimum equity requirement for pattern day traders is $25,000; they must have on
                                        deposit at least $25,000 in the account equity on any day in which day trading occurs. The
                                        minimum maintenance margin requirement for pattern day traders is 25%, the same as for
                                        regular customers.




Series_7_2E.indb 440                                                                                                                          11/19/2021 7:54:30 PM
                                                                              Unit 16   Types of Orders and Quotations     441


                       Pattern day traders are also treated differently when it comes to buying power. Buying power
                       for day traders is four times the maintenance margin excess. Maintenance margin excess
                       is defined as the equity in the account above the 25% minimum requirement. For regular
                       customers, buying power is two times SMA.

                                                                                                                                     Unit 16
                       Margin rules also prohibit day trading accounts from using account guarantees, which are
                       otherwise permitted. A cross guarantee is one for which another customer, in writing, agrees
                       to the use of money or securities in her account to carry the guaranteed accounts (i.e., to meet
                       any margin calls).


                       Approval for Day Trading Accounts
                       Member firms who promote day trading strategies must now implement procedures to
                       approve day trading accounts.

                       Before opening an account, the member must
                        provide the customer with a risk disclosure statement that outlines all the risks associated
                         with day trading (the statement can be furnished in writing or electronically) and
                        approve the account for a day trading strategy or receive from the customer a written
                         statement that the customer does not intend to engage in day trading.


                       Short Sales and Margin Requirements
                       Short sales are always done in a short margin account. In a short sale, there is a short seller,
                       a stock lender (from whom the shares are borrowed), and a buyer who purchases the shares
                       being sold short. One of the basic requirements of short selling is that the short seller, on the
                       dividend payment date, must make good to the stock lender for the dividends the lender is
                       no longer receiving from the issuer. The buyer of the shares is receiving the dividends directly
                       from the issuer. Therefore, on the dividend payment date, the short seller’s account is debited
                       the amount of the cash dividend for remittance to the stock lender.


                       Margin Deposits
                       To borrow shares for short sales, an investor must make margin deposits. Regulation T
                       specifies that the initial margin for short sales can be met with either cash or marginable
                       securities, just as in long margin transactions. Because the short seller is obligated to replace
                       the borrowed shares, sufficient cash (or buying power) must be in the account at all times to
                       enable the broker-dealer to purchase the necessary shares if the customer is unable to do so.

                       The Series 7 exam uses the following terms to describe activity in short margin accounts:
                        Short market value (SMV). The current market value of the stock position the investor
                         sells short.
                        Credit register (CR). The amount of money in the customer’s account; equal to the sales
                         proceeds plus the margin deposit requirement. Think of this as a credit balance in the
                         account.
                        Equity (EQ). The customer’s net worth in the margin account; the amount by which the
                         credit balance exceeds the current SMV of the securities in the account.

                       The amount of equity in the account is determined by this equation:

                            CR – SMV = EQ

                                        Analyzing Short Margin Account Activity
                                        To analyze short margin account activity, a simplified balance sheet will be used, just as we did
                                        with long margin accounts:

                                                CR           SMV

                                                             EQ



                                        When establishing a short margin account, there is a minimum deposit of $2,000. This
                                        minimum must be met even if the customer sells short less than $2,000 worth of securities.
                                        The Regulation T requirement for short sales is the same as it is for long purchases: 50%.

                                        with 25% on long positions. As with long margin accounts, the firm may impose a higher
                                        house minimum.

                       Short Margin Account Math
                       To illustrate how a short margin account works, assume the following.

                       A client sells short 1,000 shares of ABC at $70,000 and meets the Regulation T requirement.

                       accounting in the short margin chart should appear as follows.

                        The market value of the securities sold short is entered as the SMV.
                        The Regulation T requirement of 50% of the SMV is entered as equity.
                        The credit balance (CR) is the stock sales proceeds plus the equity deposited (SMV +
                         EQ).

                       The credit balance (CR) provides assurance to the broker-dealer that there will be cash
                       available for the customer to purchase the securities if the market value of the securities rises.
                       The risk of a short account is a stock price increase; a short seller profits only if the market
                       value of the securities declines.

                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                   For short margin accounting questions: once you get the credit balance by adding the
                                   SMV and EQ together, do not change it. Use it to compute equity after a market value
                                   change with the basic equation: CR – SMV = EQ.
                       The following illustrates the accounting for the market value decline and the resulting new
                       equity:

                              CR            SMV
                              105,000       70,000
                                            60,000 (1)


                                            EQ
                                            35,000
                                            45,000 (2)

                       The market value of the securities sold short declines to $60,000.

                       The equity increases to $45,000 as a result of the decline. This is determined as follows: CR –
                       SMV = EQ ($105,000 – $60,000 = $45,000).

                                                     PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                     18. A customer sells short 100 shares of ABC at $80 per share and meets the minimum
                                                         Regulation T requirement. Two months later, she covers the short position by
                                                         buying ABC at $70 per share. This was the only transaction in the account. What is
                                                         the maximum amount she can withdraw from the account after closing the short
                                                         position (Regulation T is 50%)?
                                                           A. $1,000
                                                          B. $4,000
                                                          C. $5,000
                                                          D. $12,000
                                                          Answer: C. The customer originally sold the stock at $80 per share and deposited
                                                          $4,000 per the Regulation T requirement ($8,000 × 50%). She now has SMV of $8,000
                                                          and a credit balance of $12,000 ($8,000 sale proceeds + $4,000 deposit). The market
                                                          value of the stock is now down to $7,000. The customer may withdraw the equity of
                                                          $5,000 when the position is closed. The simple way to do this is: she deposited $4,000
                                                          and made $1,000. That gives her $5,000—all of which is all her money.

                                        Short positions, like long positions, are marked to market daily to reflect any change in
                                        position value.

                                        What is the status of this investor’s account? Just as in long margin accounts, the short margin
                                        account statuses are as follows:
                                         Excess equity. Equity in excess of Regulation T (50% of the current SMV).
                                         Restricted. Equity less than Regulation T, and greater than or equal to minimum
                                          maintenance.
                                         Maintenance call. Equity less than minimum maintenance (30% of the SMV).
                                        By calculating the Regulation T benchmark, we can see that this account has EE and has
                                        created SMA of $15,000, as shown:

                                                                  (2)

                                               minimum maintenance = 18,000 (30% × 60,000)

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     Multiply the decrease in SMV by 1.5 to arrive at the EE and the amount that is credited
                                                     to the SMA.
                                        The EE and SMA of $15,000 are available because the equity in the account ($45,000)
                                        exceeds the Regulation T requirement ($30,000) by $15,000. Now assume that the market

                                          80,000       value to $80,000 causes the
                                                       equity to fall to $25,000
                                                       (CR – SMV = EQ).

                                                       no cash deposit required.

                            Regulation T = 40,000 (50% × 80,000)

                            minimum maintenance = 24,000 (30% × 80,000)

                       To find the maximum market value to which a short sale position can increase before a
                       maintenance call is issued, apply the following formula:

                            total credit balance ÷ 130% (1.3)

                       This is known as the SMV at maintenance.


                       Minimum Maintenance in a Short Account
                       The minimum maintenance margin requirement for short accounts is 30%. However, there
                       are exceptions based on price per share:
                        For stock trading under $5 per share, a customer must maintain 100% of SMV or $2.50
                         per share, whichever is greater.
                        For stock trading at $5 per share and above, the minimum requirement is the greater of
                         $5 per share or 30% of the short market value. As a practical matter, only when the SMV
                         exceeds $16.67 will the requirement be 30%.

                                  EXAMPLE
                                  A customer sells short 1,000 shares of stock at $4 per share. The margin deposit would
                                  be $4,000, not $2,000.
                                  A customer sells short 1,000 shares at $2 per share. The margin deposit would be
                                  $2,500.
                                  In both cases, the minimum maintenance margin requirement exceeds the initial
                                  requirement. Therefore, each customer must deposit the higher amount.

                                                          Answer: C. With the stock at $10, $5 per share is greater than 30% of the SMV.


                                        Combined (Mixed) Margin Accounts
                                        A client who has a margin account with both long and short positions in different securities
                                        has a combined account. In combined accounts, equity and margin requirements are
                                        determined by calculating the long and short positions separately and combining the results.

                                        The following example shows the use of the long and short margin charts in calculating
                                        combined equity.

                                        An investor has the following margin account positions:

                                               LMV = $50,000; SMV = $40,000; CR = $60,000; DR = $20,000

                                               SMA = $5,000 (The combined equity in this example is $50,000.)

                                        The basic equation for the calculation of combined equity is:

                                               LMV + CR – DR – SMV = EQ
                                        The formula above shows combined equity, but questions may ask for the combined
                                        Regulation T requirement or combined minimum maintenance requirements. As with
                                        questions asking about the combined equity, to calculate combined Regulation T or
                                        minimum maintenance requirements, first calculate the long, then the short, and add the two
                                        together.

                                     Answer: D. Using our mini-balance sheet, each margin account has, in essence, an
                                     asset and a liability. In the case of a long margin account, the asset is the LMV, the
                                     value of the stock held in the account. The liability is the debit balance, the money
                                     owed to the broker-dealer. In a short margin account, the asset is the credit balance.
                                     That consists of the cash proceeds from the sale plus the margin deposit. The liability
                                                                                                                                     Unit 16
                                     is the cost to buy back the stock, the SMV. We know that the equity in any account
                                     is the difference between what the investor owns and what is owed. One option
                                     is to compute the equity separately for each account and add the totals together.
                                     Another is to take all four numbers and add together the two assets (the LMV + the CR
                                     balance) and then subtract the two liabilities (the DR balance + the SMV).


                       Options and Margin
                       With the exception of LEAPS options, options are not marginable securities. When buying
                       options, customers must deposit 100% of the premium. When buying a stock on margin and
                       then writing a covered call, there is no Regulation T requirement for the call option. All the
                       customer must do is have 50% of the purchase price of the stock in the account. If you see
                       a margin question on covered call writing, be sure to focus on what is being asked: Is it the
                       Regulation T requirement, or is it the margin deposit? Consider the following examples.

                                 EXAMPLE
                                 If a customer buys stock and receives a premium by writing a call, the premium
                                 received for the call reduces the margin deposit that would be required.
                                 Question: A customer purchases 100 ABC at 62 and simultaneously writes an ABC 65
                                 call at 3 in her margin account. What is the margin deposit?
                                 Answer: The Regulation T requirement for establishing the long stock position
                                 is $3,100 (50% × $6,200). The margin deposit is $2,800, which is the Regulation T
                                 requirement reduced by the premium received. Because options trades settle T+1,
                                 the $300 from the sale will be in the account ahead of the settlement date (T+2) for
                                 the stock purchase. With $300 already in the account, the investor need only deposit
                                 $2,800 to meet the Regulation T requirement of $3,100.
                                 Question: A customer purchases 100 ABC at 62 and simultaneously writes an ABC 65
                                 call at 3 in his cash account. What is the required deposit?
                                 Answer: In a cash account, the Regulation T requirement is 100% of the purchase
                                 price of the stock—that is, $6,200. The required deposit, however, is $5,900. Once
                                 again, the option sale settles T+1, so the $300 is in the account ahead of the settlement
                                 date for the stock purchase. That reduces the required deposit. Conceptually, this
                                 is no different from making a $6,200 purchase on your charge card and receiving a
                                 $300 credit for something you returned. Your end of the month statement will show a
                                 balance due of $5,900.
                       If, in a margin account, a customer buys stock and simultaneously buys an option, the
                       customer must deposit 50% of the purchase price of the stock and 100% of the premium.

                                 EXAMPLE
                                 Question: A customer purchases 100 ABC at 62 and at the same time, buys an ABC 60
                                 put at 3. What is the margin deposit?
                                 Answer: The margin deposit is $3,400. The 50% requirement on the stock is $3,100.
                                 Because options require full payment, the customer must pay the entire premium of
                                 $300.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     LEAPS options with more than nine months to expiration are marginable. The initial
                                                     (and maintenance) requirement is 75%. But, unless the question specifically refers to
                                                     LEAPS, no borrowing is allowed to purchase options.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     A customer buys 10 XYZ LEAPS at $4.50 each. The LEAPS expire in 24 months. What
                                                     must the customer deposit?
                                                     The customer must deposit $3,375, which is 75% of the total cost of $4,500. When the
                                                     time remaining to expiration reaches nine months, the maintenance requirement is
                                                     100% of the current market value.

                                        With regard to option spreads, Regulation T requires customers to deposit the maximum loss.
                                        In debit spreads, the net debit represents the maximum loss. In credit spreads, subtract the net
                                        credit from the difference between the strike prices to determine maximum loss.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     Question: A customer buys 1 XYZ Jan 60 put at 8.50 and writes 1 XYZ Jan 50 put at
                                                     2.25. What must the customer deposit?
                                                     Answer: This is a bear put spread established at a net debit of 6.25. Because the net
                                                     debit represents maximum loss, the customer must deposit $625.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     Question: A customer buys 1 XYZ 60 call at 2.25 and writes 1 XYZ 50 call at 8.50. What
                                                     is the required deposit?
                                                     Answer: This is a bear call spread established at a net credit of 6.25. The maximum
                                                     loss is the difference between the 10-point spread of the strike prices and the 6.25
                                                     credit. That is 3.75 and makes the required deposit $375.


                                        Customer Portfolio Margining (CPM)
                                        As with some other points we’ve made throughout the course, this topic is in FINRA’s content
                                        outline, but we have not run across it in the exam. We will post to Exam Tips and Content
                                        Updates when we learn anything new.

                                        Customer portfolio margining (CPM) is a different way to calculate margin requirements
                                        for an account based on the net risk of an entire portfolio of securities rather than a
                                        standardized percentage applied to each individual position. Margin requirements calculated
                                        this way are generally lower than those that are calculated conventionally. Broker-dealers must
                                        meet certain requirements if they wish to offer portfolio margining to customers. Among
                                        those are the following:
                                         The customer must be approved to engage in uncovered short option transactions.
                                         Depending on the firm’s capabilities, customer accounts must have a minimum equity of
                                          $100,000 or even more.
                                         REITs, even those listed on the NYSE, can be included.

              LESSON 16.5: RULES OF THE SECURITIES MARKETPLACES
                         LO 16.e Determine the rules and regulations pertaining to trading securities.

                                                                                                                                      Unit 16
                         NYSE Euronext
                         The NYSE is the most widely known stock exchange. Although exchanges are called stock
                         markets, other securities, such as bonds and/or options, may trade there as well. Often called
                         the Big Board, the NYSE is the largest of all U.S.-listed exchanges. Stocks listed on the NYSE
                         can also be listed on regional exchanges, such as the Chicago Stock Exchange. It should be
                         noted that the exchange does not influence or determine the price of securities traded there.


                         Exchange Listing Requirements
                         Securities traded on the NYSE, known as listed securities, must satisfy the exchange’s listing
                         requirements. Generally, a corporation that wants its securities listed must have a minimum
                         number of publicly held shares and a minimum number of shareholders, each holding 100
                         shares or more. Although the minimum numerical criteria are not tested, it is important that
                         you recognize that only companies of significant size and public ownership qualify for listing
                         on the NYSE.

                         Only NYSE members (individual seat owners) can trade on the floor.

                         The NYSE is not the only exchange; regional exchanges tend to focus on the securities of
                         companies within their regions, although they also offer trading in many securities listed on
                         the NYSE. This is known as dual listing. Listing requirements on regional exchanges are often
                         less stringent than those of the national exchanges, and the companies they list are usually
                         among the smallest and newest in their industries.


                         Designated Market Maker (DMM)
                         DMMs facilitate trading in specific stocks, and their chief function is to maintain a fair and
                         orderly market in those stocks. In fulfilling this function, they act as both brokers and dealers.
                         They act as dealers when they execute trades for their own accounts and as brokers when they
                         execute orders other members leave with them. The specialist (DMM) acts as an auctioneer.
                         In return for providing this service to the exchange, DMMs receive rebates on fees charged by
                         the exchange whenever their quotes result in trades.


                         Auction Market
                         Exchange securities are bought and sold in an auction market. Exchange markets are also
                         sometimes called double-auction markets because both buyers and sellers call out their best
                         bids and offers in an attempt to transact business at the best possible price.

                         To establish the best bid, a buying broker-dealer must initiate a bid at least $0.01 higher than
                         the current best bid. The best offer by a selling broker-dealer must be at least $0.01 lower than
                         the current best offer.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     A quote might look like this:
                                                     Last          Bid               Ask             Size
                                                     $46.71        $46.66            $46.74          30 × 14

                                        Several bids at the same price and several offers at the same price may occur. To provide for
                                        the orderly transaction of business on the floor, the highest bids and lowest offers always
                                        receive first consideration.


                                        Priority, Precedence, and Parity
                                        When more than one broker enters the same bid or offer, the specialist (DMM) awards the
                                        trade in the following order:
                                        1. Priority—first order in
                                        2. Precedence—largest order of those submitted
                                        3. Parity—spin the parity wheel (random)


                                        Volatile Market Conditions Rule 80B
                                        Rules known as the market-wide circuit breaker rules protect against rapid, uncontrolled drops
                                        in the market. A market-wide trading halt will be triggered if the S&P 500 Index declines in
                                        price by specified percentages from the prior day’s closing price of that index. Those triggers
                                        are currently set at three circuit breaker thresholds as follows:

                                        Level 1 halt = 7% decline in S&P 500
                                         Before 3:25 pm—15 minutes;
                                         At or after 3:25 pm—trading may continue, unless there is a Level 3 halt
                                        Level 2 halt = 13% decline in S&P 500
                                         Before 3:25 pm—15 minutes;
                                         At or after 3:25 pm—trading may continue, unless there is a Level 3 halt
                                        Level 3 halt = 20% decline in S&P 500
                                         At any time—trading will halt and not resume for the rest of the day
                                        A Level 1 or 2 halt cannot occur more than one time per day. In other words, if a Level 1 halt
                                        has already occurred, it would take a Level 2 halt to stop trading again.

                                        Finally, trading halts for individual listed securities trading on an exchange will generally be
                                        initiated by the exchange itself or by the SEC. For OTC stocks, either FINRA or specific
                                        trading venues such as Nasdaq can initiate a trading halt. The halt can be caused by good or
                                        bad news.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     During a market halt, while no trading can occur, investors can still cancel existing
                                                     (open) orders that had been entered previously.

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 21. If the S&P 500 is down 13% by 11 am at the NYSE, what happens?
                                       A. This is a Level 1 halt and the market will halt trading for 15 minutes.
                                       B. This is a Level 2 halt and the market will halt trading for 15 minutes.

                                                                                                                                       Unit 16
                                       C. This is a Level 3 halt and the market will halt trading for 30 minutes.
                                       D. Nothing happens until the S&P 500 drops 15%, then trading will halt for 30
                                            minutes.
                                      Answer: B. A Level 2 halt occurs when the S&P 500 drops 13% from the opening.
                                      Trading will halt for 15 minutes.


                       Arbitrage
                       Arbitrage is a trading strategy that specialized traders, called arbitrageurs, use to profit from
                       temporary price differences between markets or securities. In general, arbitrageurs look for
                       ways to profit from temporary price disparities in the same or equivalent securities. This term
                       frequently appears in questions about market manipulation. Unlike the examples of market
                       manipulation, arbitrage is a perfectly legal activity.


                       Market Arbitrage
                       Some securities trade in more than one market—on two exchanges, for instance—creating
                       the possibility that one security may sell for two different prices at the same time. When that
                       happens, arbitrageurs buy at the lower price in one market and sell simultaneously at the
                       higher price in the other. Arbitrage is not a type of market manipulation.


                       Convertible Security Arbitrage
                       Arbitrage trades are also possible in equivalent securities—convertible bonds and the
                       underlying stock, for instance. If conditions are right, an arbitrageur may be able to convert
                       bonds to stock and sell the stock for a profit.

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 22. During a trading halt, an investor can
                                      A. cancel an order that was placed before the halt.
                                      B. execute a market order.
                                      C. execute a limit order.
                                      D. close an existing position.
                                      Answer: A. Once there is a trading halt, it stops all trading in the security until the
                                      halt expires. Canceling an order does not involve any trading. Please do not confuse
                                      this with something similar we learned in Lesson 10.1. Although trading in a security
                                      stops, options on that security may still be exercised.


                       COD Trades
                       In Lesson 1.1, we described the delivery versus payment (DVP) and receipt versus payment
                       (RVP) accounts. Those are accounts, primarily for institutional clients, where the delivery of
                       securities purchased is made to a third party acting as an agent for the purchaser. This third
                       party is usually a bank and holds the institution’s money. Payment is made upon delivery to
                       the agent. RVP is the opposite—the agent delivers the securities concurrent with the payment
                       by the purchaser.

                                        FINRA Rule 11860 refers these as collect on delivery (COD) and payment on delivery
                                        (POD) transactions. Members cannot accept an order on a COD or POD basis unless
                                        members follow all of the FINRA rule procedures, as follows:
                                         The member shall have received from the customer prior to or at the time of accepting
                                          the order, the name and address of the agent and the time and account number of the
                                          customer on file with the agent and institution number, where appropriate.
                                         Each order accepted from the customer pursuant to such an arrangement has noted
                                          thereon the fact that it is a POD or COD transaction.
                                         The member shall deliver to the customer a confirmation, or all relevant data customarily
                                          contained in a confirmation with respect to the execution of the order, not later than the
                                          close of business on the next business day after any such execution.
                                         The member shall have obtained an agreement from the customer that the customer
                                          will furnish its agent instructions with respect to the receipt or delivery of the securities
                                          involved in the transaction promptly upon receipt by the customer of each confirmation.

                                        Trades in these accounts qualify for a special rule under Regulation T. If a broker-dealer
                                        purchases for or sells to a customer a security in a delivery against payment transaction,
                                        the broker-dealer has up to 35 calendar days to obtain payment if delivery of the security
                                        is delayed because of the mechanics of the transaction and is not related to the customer’s
                                        willingness or ability to pay.

              INTRODUCTION
                         Since the Great Depression, the securities industry has been closely regulated in the interest of
                         protecting the investor. To that end, the processes of issuing securities and trading them once
                         issued are subject to careful regulatory procedures. It is also recognized that investing money
                         is inherently risky. The laws cannot eliminate all risks. Instead, they require that investors
                         receive enough information to be able to assess the risk accurately and be able to make sound
                         investment decisions. To apply an understanding of the disclosure requirements, the registered
                         representative must recognize regulatory standards. Think of this unit as a view of the “back-
                         office” directives. It covers the mechanics of what happens when the customer decides to
                         implement a decision to buy or sell securities and follows it through to settlement.

           LESSON 17.1: THE ORDER TICKET
                                         LO 17.a Recall the information required to be on an order ticket.



                                         Order Memorandum
                                         Although the term you will use in everyday work is order ticket, technically, the SEC uses
                                         the term order memorandum. Traditionally, when entering a customer order, the registered
                                         representative has manually filled out an order ticket. Increasingly, representatives are entering
                                         orders electronically.

                                         After the representative prepares the order ticket, it is sent to the wire room or trading desk,
                                         where the order is routed to the proper market for execution. A registered principal must
                                         approve the order promptly after execution. FINRA’s interpretation of the term promptly after
                                         execution is no later than the end of the trading day. Approval consists of checking for errors
                                         and—especially for discretionary accounts or trades in high-risk securities—suitability. Errors
                                         do happen.

                                         A customer order is most susceptible to error at two points: communication of the order
                                         between customer and broker and transmission of the order from broker to wire operator.

                                         Breakdowns in communication in the ordering process most often occur because of inaccurate
                                         information on a ticket. For example, a buy limit order is entered as a buy stop order. Or,
                                         a market order is entered as a limit order. Sometimes, when a customer has more than one
                                         account, the order ticket is written for the wrong account. This can happen when there is a
                                         married couple and each has their own account and they also have a joint account. In the rush
                                         to get the trade done, the registered representative may “hit the wrong button.”

                                         The information required on the order ticket includes
                                          customer account number;
                                          registered representative identification number;
                                          whether the order is solicited or unsolicited;
                                          whether the order is subject to discretionary authority;
                                          description of the security (symbol);
                                          number of shares or bonds to be traded;
                                          action (buy, sell long, or sell short);
                                          options (buy, write, covered, uncovered, opening, or closing);
                                          order restrictions and price qualifications (e.g., market, GTC, or day order);
                                          type of account (cash or margin); and
                                          the time the order was received, the time of entry, and the price at which it was executed.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     The account name or number must be on an order ticket before order execution.

                                                     Two items that would not be on an order ticket are the current market price of the
                                                     security and the client’s name or address.

                       If a mistake is made (e.g., a wrong account number), no change to the order can be made
                       without the approval of a principal or the branch manager. All the facts surrounding the
                       change must be put in writing and retained for three years.


                       Report of Execution
                       The registered representative receives a report after a trade is executed. He first checks the
                       execution report against the order ticket to make sure that everything was done as the
                       customer requested. If everything is in order, he reports the execution to the customer. If
                       an error exists, the representative must report it to the branch office manager or principal
                       immediately. As stated earlier, changing an account number on an order ticket (cancel and
                       rebill) requires manager approval.


                       Incorrect Trade Reports
                       Sometimes the details of a trade are reported to a customer incorrectly. Even when the                        Unit 17
                       reporting mistake was made by the firm, the actual trade is binding on the customer.
                       However, if execution takes place outside the customer’s instructions, the trade is not binding.
                       For example, if the customer order was for 200 shares and the trade was reported as 300
                       shares, the customer is not obligated for the extra 100 shares.


                       Reporting an Error
                       FINRA rules require that a record of any errors be reported to the person designated to receive
                       such error reports by the firm. At a broker-dealer, that individual would always be a manager
                       or someone who holds a principal’s license. All such reports should be made immediately in
                       writing and retained for three years under the general record retention rules.

                       These reports may be referred to as error reports, error records, trade correction reports, or any
                       number of generic names a firm might assign to such records.

                                 TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                 If justified, a supervisory person with the broker-dealer, but not a registered
                                 representative, may correct a bona fide error. A rep of a broker-dealer cannot do this
                                 because of the concern that any such payment may conceal individual misconduct.

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 1.   As with all businesses, mistakes happen. What document is checked by the registered
                                      representative to verify the accuracy of a trade?
                                        A. The customer confirmation
                                       B. The broker-dealer confirmation
                                        C. The execution report
                                       D. The order flow report
                                      Answer: C. It is the execution report that is reviewed by the registered representative
                                      to verify the trade matched the submitted order. The confirmations come later and
                                      we want to make sure they are accurate.

           LESSON 17.2: ORDER FLOW
                                         LO 17.b Define the function and procedures of securities trading and reporting in
                                         the secondary market.

                                         When things work the way they are supposed to, this is the way the flow of an order looks.

           Figure 17.1: Order Process Diagram

                                                Customer places order
                                                 with a broker-dealer.




                                                Order is entered, and
                                               order ticket is generated.




            Order is transmitted to NYSE floor                              Order is executed OTC
              a) not held orders directed                           a) firm acts as agent and acquires
                 to floor brokers                                      security on customer’s behalf
              b) limit orders, stop orders, and                     b) firm fills order as principal
                 market orders to order book                           (from inventory)




                                            Execution report is generated.




                                                Trade is reported to
                                            Consolidated Tape or Nasdaq.



                                              Customer confirmation is
                                                 sent and copied to
                                              registered representative.



                                            Trade settlement is processed
                                            through margin department/
                                               cashiering department.


                                         These are the basic steps taken once the order leaves the broker-dealer’s hands. As would be
                                         true when we are shopping anywhere, the final step is the cashier. In our business, if the trade
                                         is on margin, then there is a quick stop at the margin department to determine the final bill
                                         (the amount of the call).

                                                PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                2.    Which department in a brokerage firm handles all customer transactions using
                                                      credit?
                                                       A. Margin
                                                       B. Cashiering

                                                       D. Reorganization
                                                      Answer: A. Yes, there will be questions this simple on the real exam. Margin is using
                                                      credit so, obviously, it is the margin department that handles credit. Students miss
                                                      questions like this because they think there is a trick.

                                      FINRA has established an “alphabet” of systems and processes to help the flow of transactions
                                      move. We will look at them in no specific order.



                                                                                                                                                        Unit 17

                                      Orders generally begin by getting a quote for the security. Nasdaq provides a computer link
                                      between broker-dealers that trade OTC. The system provides three levels of stock quotation
                                      service to the securities industry.
                                       Nasdaq Level 1 is available to registered representatives through a variety of public
                                        vendors. Level 1 displays the inside market only, the highest bids and the lowest asks
                                        for securities included in the system, and other basic information such as last sale and
                                        volume. Normal market price fluctuations prevent a registered representative from
                                        guaranteeing a Level 1 price to a client.
                                       Nasdaq Level 2 is available to approved subscribers only. Level 2 provides the current
                                        quote and quote size available from each market maker in a security in the system. To list
                                        a quote on Level 2, a market maker must guarantee that the quote is firm for at least 100
                                        shares.
                                       Nasdaq Level 3 provides subscribers with all the services of Levels 1 and 2 and allows
                                        registered market makers to input and update their quotes on any securities in which they
                                        make a market.

                                                    Not all OTC securities are listed on Nasdaq. For instance, government and municipal
                                                    securities, while traded OTC, are not listed on Nasdaq.


                                        Rule 613 (Consolidated Audit Trail)
                                        The SEC adopted Rule 613 to create a comprehensive consolidated audit trail (CAT) that
                                        would allow regulators to efficiently and accurately track all activity, including options,
                                        throughout the U.S. markets in National Market System (NMS) securities. The rule specifies
                                        the type of data to be collected and when the data is to be reported to a central repository.

                                        In particular, the rule requires each SRO, as well as their respective members, to provide
                                        certain detailed information to a central repository regarding each quote and order in a
                                        security, and each reportable event with respect to each quote and order, such as origination,
                                        modification, cancellation, routing, and execution.


                                        Dark Pools of Liquidity
                                        Dark pools, sometimes called dark pools of liquidity or simply dark liquidity, is trading
                                        volume that occurs or liquidity that is not openly available to the public. The bulk of this
                                        volume represents trades engaged in by institutional traders and trading desks away from
                                        the exchange markets. Generally, these are large volume transactions that occur on crossing
                                        networks or alternative trading systems (ATS) that match buy and sell orders electronically for
                                        execution without routing the order to an exchange or other market where the quote, last sale
                                        price, and volume information is displayed.

                                        Institutional trading desks that choose to utilize dark pools are able to execute large block
                                        orders without affecting public quotes or price, or revealing their investment strategy
                                        regarding any of their holding accumulations or divestitures. Additionally, orders can be
                                        placed anonymously so that the identity of the entity placing the order is unknown to the
                                        general investing public, along with the volume and price for the transaction. The concern
                                        with dark pools is that some market participants are left disadvantaged because they cannot
                                        see the trades, volume, or prices agreed upon within the pools, and thus market transparency
                                        is darkened.


                                        Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE)
                                        The Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE) is the FINRA-approved trade
                                        reporting system for corporate and government agency bonds trading in the OTC secondary
                                        market. Reporting to TRACE enables better market transparency as trade details are
                                        disseminated immediately to the investing public.

                                        TRACE is a trade reporting system only. It is not an execution system. It does not accept
                                        quotations, nor does it provide settlement and clearance functions. Following are the
                                        reporting rules for TRACE:
                                         Both sides of the transaction must report.
                                         Trades must be reported as soon as practicable and no later than 15 minutes after
                                          execution.
                                         Execution date, time of trade, quantity, price, yield, and if price reflects a commission
                                          charged are all reportable and displayed.

                       While most corporate debt securities, asset-backed securities (ABS), Treasury securities, and
                       collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs) are TRACE eligible, there are exclusions. The
                       following is a list of exclusions to know:
                        Debt of foreign governments
                        Money market instruments
                        Debt securities that are not depositary trust eligible


                       Trade Reporting Facilities (TRFs)
                       Trade reporting facilities (TRFs) are facilities through which members report transactions in
                       stocks listed on the NYSE and the Nasdaq Stock market when the trades are made off the
                       exchange, (OTC). All OTC transactions in equity securities to which a FINRA member is a
                       party must be reported to FINRA, unless expressly excepted from the trade reporting rules.

                                                                                                                                  Unit 17
                       Reportable transactions include OTC trades in OTC equity securities and transactions in
                       restricted equity securities effected pursuant to Securities Act Rule 144A. These 144A trades
                       are made by qualified institutional buyers. This even includes secondary transactions in
                       unlisted DPP and REIT securities.

                       The “normal market hours” are from 9:30:00:000 a.m. until 4:00:00:000 p.m. Eastern Time,
                       and trades with an execution time outside of this period are considered “outside normal
                       market hours.” The FINRA Facilities support milliseconds. Thus, for example, a trade
                       executed at 4:00:00:001 is considered “outside normal market hours” and must be modified
                       accordingly.

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 3.   TRACE can best be described as
                                       A. an execution system.
                                       B. an order display and execution system.
                                       C. a quotation system.
                                       D. a trade reporting system.
                                      Answer: D. TRACE is a FINRA trade reporting system. If you remembered that the
                                      acronym stands for Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine, the answer is obvious.
                                      Subscribers can access last sale information on eligible fixed income such as
                                      corporate bonds and U.S. agency debentures transactions in the OTC market.


                       Role of the NYSE DMM
                       After almost 100 years of domination on the floor of the NYSE, the era of the specialist ended
                       as 2008 came to a close. Replacing the specialist (and doing essentially the same work) is the
                       DMM. As of the date of print, all of the DMMs work for one of seven NYSE member firms.

                       A DMM is a person who represents a member firm of the NYSE. The DMM’s primary role
                       is to facilitate trading in certain stocks. DMMs must make a market in the stock they trade
                       by displaying their best bid and ask prices to the market during trading hours. They also
                       are required to maintain a fair and orderly market in the stocks they trade. They do this by
                       stepping in with their own capital to help reduce market volatility when there is an imbalance
                       of buy and sell orders. While the number of stocks a DMM trades depends on how active the
                       stock trades, most DMMs are responsible for trading 5–10 stocks.

                       In addition to maintaining an orderly market, a secondary function of the DMM is to
                       minimize price disparities that may occur at the opening of daily trading. They do this by

                                         buying or selling (as a dealer) stock from their own inventory only when a need for such
                                         intervention exists. Otherwise, the DMM lets public supply and demand set the market’s
                                         course. Maintaining a market in a stock requires considerable financial resources. Therefore,
                                         the DMM must have enough capital to maintain a substantial position in the security.

                                         A DMM must abide by certain NYSE floor rules in the daily conduct of her business. The
                                         DMM
                                          must maintain a fair and orderly market;
                                          must stand ready to buy and sell for her own account, if necessary, to maintain a fair and
                                           orderly market;
                                          is expected to transact business for her own account in such a way as to maintain price
                                           continuity and minimize temporary price disparities attributable to supply and demand
                                           differences;
                                          must avoid transacting business for her own account at the opening or reopening of
                                           trading in a stock if this would upset the public balance of supply and demand;
                                          must file the reports and keep the books and records the NYSE requires; and
                                          may trade for her own account in between the current bid and ask quotes in its book.


                                         Agent and Principal
                                         The DMMs are both agents and principals. On the NYSE floor, they can act in the following
                                         ways:
                                          As agents, they execute all orders brokerage firms leave with them. They accept certain
                                           kinds of orders from members, such as limit and stop orders, and execute these as
                                           conditions permit.
                                          As principals, or dealers, they buy and sell in their own accounts to make markets in
                                           assigned stocks. They are expected to maintain continuous, fair, and orderly markets—
                                           that is, markets with reasonable price variations. However, a DMM may not buy stock for
                                           her own account at a price that would compete with the current market. In other words, a
                                           specialist cannot buy, as principal, at a price that would satisfy a customer order to buy.


                                         Municipal Bond Reporting

                                         Electronic Municipal Market Access (EMMA)
                                         The electronic municipal market access (EMMA) website is funded and operated by the
                                         Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB). EMMA is a centralized online site used to
                                         locate key information about municipal securities. The information on EMMA is presented
                                         for retail, nonprofessional investors. It is free of charge. EMMA makes available official
                                         statements (OSs) (the municipal equivalent of a prospectus) for most new municipal bond
                                         offerings, 529 college savings plans, and other municipal securities. Ratings information is
                                         also available. In fact, if an issuer’s rating changes, the information surrounding the change
                                         is posted. EMMA also provides real-time access to prices, as well as prices and rates from
                                         remarketing agents regarding auction rate securities (ARS).


                                         Real-Time Transaction Reporting System
                                         The MSRB operates the Real-Time Transaction Reporting System (RTRS). The system
                                         collects and disseminates transaction data in municipal securities for market transparency,



Series_7_2E.indb 460                                                                                                                   11/19/2021 7:54:36 PM

                      surveillance purposes, and analytics. Broker-dealers and municipal securities dealers must
                      report transactions in municipal securities pursuant to MSRB Rule G-14. Firms may employ
                      agents for the purpose of submitting transaction data. However, the primary responsibility for
                      timely and accurate submission remains with the firm that effected the transaction. The data is
                      captured and made available to the marketplace within 15 minutes of a trade.

                      For regulatory purposes, RTRS maintains an audit trail and provides regulators with
                      transaction data and related information to enhance surveillance capabilities. The RTRS
                      surveillance database stores each trade report submitted by, or on behalf of, a dealer, and
                      audit trail reports provide, among other things, information about trades effected by a dealer,
                      modifications and cancelations reported by, or on behalf of, a dealer, and trades in specific
                      municipal securities shown by their CUSIP numbers.

                      One notable exception from the reporting requirements are municipal fund securities
                      (e.g., Section 529 plans).

                      Types of Markets
                      Following are three market terms that might appear on the exam. Let’s define them for you.


                      Third Market
                      The third market is a trading market in which exchange-listed securities are traded in the
                      OTC market. Broker-dealers registered as OTC market makers in listed securities can do
                      transactions in the third market. All securities listed on the NYSE and most securities listed
                      on the regional exchanges are eligible for OTC trading as long as the trades are reported
                      within 90 seconds of execution.


                      Fourth Market
                      The fourth market is a market for institutional investors in which large blocks of stock, both
                      listed and unlisted, trade in transactions unassisted by broker-dealers. These transactions take
                      place through electronic communications networks (ECNs). ECNs are open 24 hours a day
                      and act solely as agents.


                      Grey Market
                      The grey market refers to a security not currently traded on any of the OTC quoting
                      marketplaces (e.g., Pink Open Market) or quoted on any other U.S. quotation medium such
                      as Nasdaq. Broker-dealers are not willing or able to publicly quote OTC securities because of
                      a lack of investor interest, company information availability, or regulatory compliance.

           LESSON 17.3: GOOD DELIVERY UNDER FINRA’S UNIFORM PRACTICE
                        CODE (UPC)
                                         LO 17.c Identify the various components that make up good delivery of securities.



                                         The Uniform Practice Code (UPC)
                                         “The Uniform Practice Code (UPC) is a series of rules, interpretations and explanations
                                         designed to make uniform, where practicable, custom, practice, usage, and trading technique
                                         in the investment banking and securities business, particularly with regards to operational
                                         and settlement issues. These can include such matters as trade terms, deliveries, payments,
                                         dividends, computation of interest, and marking to the market.” —FINRA's Market
                                         Transparency Reporting Tools

                                         FINRA created the UPC so that the transaction of day-to-day business by members may
                                         be simplified and facilitated, that business disputes and misunderstandings, which arise
                                         from uncertainty and lack of uniformity in such matters, may be eliminated, and that the
                                         mechanisms of a free and open market may be improved and run smoothly.

                                         All OTC transactions in securities by members, except transactions in securities that are
                                         exempted the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including municipal securities, are subject to
                                         the provisions of the UPC.

                                         For exam purposes, the most tested portion of the UPC deals with delivery and payment of
                                         securities transactions.


                                         Making Good Delivery
                                         Good delivery is a delivery where everything is in good order such that a transaction settles
                                         satisfactorily. There are a number of requirements, such as the proper time, size, and
                                         documentation. We will look at those most likely to be on your exam, starting with time and
                                         size. That will be followed by explaining good delivery form. It is the registered representative’s
                                         responsibility to ensure that a security is in good deliverable form when a customer sells it.


                                         Time for Delivery
                                         The settlement date is the date on which ownership changes between buyer and seller. It is
                                         the date on which broker-dealers are required to exchange the securities and funds involved in
                                         a transaction and customers are requested to pay for securities bought and to deliver securities
                                         sold. There are several specified good delivery times.


                                         Regular Way Settlement
                                         Unless otherwise specified at the time of the trade, all settlements are made the regular way.
                                         Regular way settlement for most securities transactions is the second business day following
                                         the trade date, known as T+2.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     If a trade occurs on a Tuesday (trade date), it will settle regular way on Thursday.
                                                     If a trade takes place on a Thursday, it will settle the following Monday.

                                                                                     Unit 17   Processing Transactions     463


                       Knowing that not all securities settle T+2 is equally important, and a summary of settlement
                       rules is included later in this section. Corporate securities, municipals, and government
                       agency securities settle T+2. U.S. government T-bills, T-notes, T-bonds, and options settle
                       next business day—T+1. Money market securities transactions settle the same day. In trades
                       between dealers, if the seller delivers before the settlement date, the buyer may either accept
                       the security or refuse it without prejudice.

                                  TAKE NOTE
                                  Interdealer trades in government securities settle in federal funds. Interdealer trades
                                  in all other securities settle in clearinghouse funds. Federal funds represent payments
                                  that have same day availability. The most common examples of clearinghouse funds
                                  are personal (or business) checks. Those take time to clear and are not considered
                                  immediately available funds.


                                                                                                                                    Unit 17
                       Cash Settlement
                       In connection with a transaction for “cash,” delivery shall be made at the office of the
                       purchaser on the day of the transaction. Stocks or bonds sold for cash settlement must be
                       available on the spot for delivery to the buyer.

                       Cash trade settlement occurs no later than 2:30 pm ET if the trade is executed before
                       2:00 pm. If the trade occurs after 2:00 pm, settlement is due within 30 minutes.


                       Seller’s Option Contracts
                       Seller’s option contracts are a form of settlement that are available to customers who want
                       to sell securities but know they cannot deliver the physical securities in time for regular way
                       settlement. A seller’s option contract lets a customer lock in a selling price for securities
                       without having to make delivery on the second business day. Instead, the seller can settle
                       the trade as specified in the contract. Or, if the seller elects to settle earlier than originally
                       specified, the trade can be settled on any date from the third business day through the
                       contract date, provided the buyer is given a one-day written notice.
                       A buyer’s option contract works the same way, with the buyer specifying when settlement will
                       take place. The exam does not ask, “Why would someone do this?” You only need to know
                       what the terms mean.


                       When-, As-, and If-Issued Contracts (When-Issued Trades)
                       Typically, new municipal bond issues are sold to investors before the bonds are issued and
                       available for delivery. An investor receives a when-issued confirmation describing the bonds.
                       The confirmation does not include a total dollar amount or settlement date because, until
                       the settlement date is known, the accrued interest cannot be calculated to determine the total
                       dollar amount. Once the bonds are issued, the investor receives a new confirmation stating the
                       purchase price and settlement date.

                       A when-issued transaction confirmation must include
                        a description of the security;
                        the purchase price (dollar bond) or yield (serial bond); and
                        the trade date.




Series_7_2E.indb 463                                                                                                     11/19/2021 7:54:36 PM

                                         Because the settlement date is unknown, a when-issued confirmation for bonds cannot
                                         include accrued interest. That means it will not show the total dollar amount due.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     As we discussed in Lesson 16.4, Regulation T specifies the date customers are required
                                                     to pay for purchase transactions. The settlement date, however, is the date customers
                                                     are requested to deliver payment or the securities involved in transactions. Under
                                                     Regulation T, payment is legally due two business days after settlement date. Failure
                                                     to make payment on time can lead to an account freeze, unless the broker-dealer has
                                                     received an extension from its designated examining authority (DEA).

                                                     TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                     The following table gives a summary of the trade settlements and delivery times for
                                                     different securities and different types of settlement choices.

            Regulation T                                                          2 business days after regular way

                                         Assume a question is asking about the normal customer settlement terms, regular way, unless
                                         the question specifically mentions Regulation T.
                                         In addition, here is a hint on municipal when-issued settlements. A probable question will ask
                                         either what is not included or what is included on a when-issued confirmation. To discern the
                                         correct answer, remember SAT, which identifies what is not included:
                                          Settlement date
                                          Accrued interest
                                          Total dollar amount due at settlement
                                         If a question asks when customer confirmations must be sent, the answer is no later than the
                                         settlement date. However, if the question asks when broker-to-broker confirmations must be
                                         sent, the answer is no later than the business day following the trade date (T+1).


                                         Don’t Know (DK) Notice
                                         In an interdealer trade, each side electronically submits its version of the transaction to the
                                         Automated Confirmation Transaction System. If one side does not recognize the other side’s
                                         details of the transaction (e.g., the number of shares is wrong, or the price is wrong), it will
                                         electronically DK (don’t know) the trade.

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 DKs are used in interdealer trades for which one party to the transaction does not
                                 recognize the trade or, if it does, disagrees with the terms of the trade as submitted by
                                 the other party.
                                 The term can also be used within a member firm when an order or wire room does not
                                 recognize the account number or other information on an order ticket.
                                 The exam is not likely to get into the procedures followed after the DK notice is sent.
                                 That is for coverage on principal’s exams.


                       Due Bills
                       If one of your customers buys a stock before the ex-dividend date, the customer is entitled to
                       the dividend. However, if the trade is somehow mishandled and does not settle until after the
                       record date, the seller will receive the dividend in error. In this case, your firm should send a
                                                                                                                                    Unit 17
                       due bill to the seller’s firm stating, “Our customer is due the dividend—kindly remit.”

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 Broker-dealers send due bills when the wrong party receives a dividend, interest, or
                                 rights from the issuer.

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 5.   A confirmation of each customer trade must be given or sent
                                       A. on the trade date.
                                       B. before the trade date.
                                       C. on or before the settlement date.
                                       D. before the settlement date.
                                      Answer: C. SEC rules require that a confirmation must be given or sent to a customer
                                      at or before the completion of the transaction (the settlement date).


                       Good Deliverable Form
                       Good delivery describes the physical condition of, signatures on, attachments to, and
                       denomination of the certificates involved in a securities transaction. Good delivery is normally
                       a back-office consideration between buying and selling brokers. In any member-to-member
                       transaction, the delivered securities must be accompanied by a properly executed uniform
                       delivery ticket. Every issue has a transfer agent. The transfer agent is the final arbiter of
                       whether a security meets the requirements of good delivery.


                       Overdelivery and Underdelivery
                       In settling customer sell transactions in which the securities delivery matches the exact
                       number of shares or bonds sold, the first rule of good delivery is met. But if the customer
                       overdelivers or underdelivers, the transaction is not good delivery.

                                 EXAMPLE
                                 Overdelivery: A customer sells 300 shares and brings in one certificate for 325 shares.
                                 Underdelivery: A customer sells 100 shares and brings in one certificate for 80 shares.

                                         Partial Delivery
                                         A member-to-member partial delivery is acceptable under Uniform Practice Rules if the
                                         amount remaining to be delivered does not include an odd-lot.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     Delivering 200 shares to satisfy a 300-share sale would be good delivery (the amount
                                                     remaining is a round lot). However, delivering 250 shares in the same sce­nario would
                                                     not be good delivery, because it would be a mix of two round lots and an odd-lot.


                                         Good Delivery Clearing Rule (100-Share Uniform Units)
                                         Please pay attention to the good delivery clearing rule because is it highly tested. When one
                                         broker-dealer delivers stock certificates to another broker-dealer, the firm separate round lots
                                         and odd lots. Round lot certificates are good delivery as long as they are in 100s or multiple
                                         of 100s. In simple terms, as long as the certificate ends in 00 (e.g., 400, 1,200, 8,500), it
                                         meets the conditions of the UPC. When it comes to odd lots, members can make round lot
                                         deliveries of them if the odd lots add up to a single round lot.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     Using odd lots to make round lots:
                                                     The trade is for 200 shares. If the firm delivers four certificates of 50 shares each, that is
                                                     good delivery. Why? Because taking two of the certificates together equals 100 shares.
                                                     That can be done twice to total 200 shares. Another alternative would be 1-70 share
                                                     certificate, 1-60 share certificate, 1-40 share certificate, and 1-30 share certificate. How
                                                     so? Take the 70 and the 30 and we have 100. Then take the 60 and the 40 and we have
                                                     the next 100.
                                         If the trade has an odd-lot, any number of certificates adding up to that odd-lot is acceptable.
                                         For example, a trade for 67 shares can be a 50 plus a 17, or a 25, plus a 30, plus a 12. Here is
                                         another example.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     For a 300-share sale, the seller could deliver
                                                          one 300-share certificate;
                                                          three 100-share certificates;
                                                          six 50-share certificates;
                                                          two 100-share certificates, one 60 share certificate, and one 40 share certificate; or
                                                          three 60-share certificates and three 40-share certificates.
                                                     Each of these deliveries meets the requirements of the rule. However, delivering four
                                                     75-share certificates would not be good delivery. Think of it this way: can you take
                                                     the certificates and make piles of 100 shares? If the answer is yes, it is good delivery.
                                                     There is no way to get stacks of 100 shares if you only have certificates of 75 shares.
                                                     Remember, the fact that 4 × 75 = 300 is irrelevant. The rule states that certificates of
                                                     less than 100 shares can only be used if you can make separate piles of 100 each.

                       Good Delivery for Bonds
                       The rules for good delivery are the same for corporate and municipal bonds. Delivery of
                       bonds in coupon or bearer form should be made in denominations of $1,000 or $5,000.
                       Fully registered bonds are delivered in denominations of $1,000 or multiples of $1,000, but
                       never larger than $100,000. Municipal bonds may settle in bearer or registered form and be
                       delivered in the denominations stated earlier.


                       Missing Coupons
                       If coupons are missing from a bond, it is not good delivery. If an issuer is in default on a
                       coupon bond, all of the unpaid coupons must be attached for it to be good delivery.

                                 TAKE NOTE


                                                                                                                                      Unit 17
                                 From a practical standpoint, with coupon bonds not issued since the mid-1980s, there
                                 are very few of these left. Once again, we remind you that we are in the “test” world
                                 and not necessarily the “real” word.

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 6.   All of the following would be good delivery for 470 shares except
                                       A. two 100-share certificates and three 90-share certificates.
                                       B. four 100-share certificates and one 70-share certificate.
                                       C. eight 50-share certificates, one 40-share certificate, and one 30-share
                                             certificate.
                                       D. 47 10-share certificates.
                                      Answer: A. We want to know which of these does not follow the rule.

                                      In choice A, we have two 100-share certificates—that’s great for 200 shares. We
                                      also have three 90-share certificates. How do we make two stacks of 100, plus an
                                      additional 70 shares for the odd-lot? We can’t. Yes, 3 × 90 = 270 (the remaining
                                      shares), but we need stacks of 100. With a 90-share certificate, you need a 10 to make
                                      100 and we don’t have that.

                                      Look at the others to see how they meet the rule.

                                      B. Four stacks of 100 and one stack of 70—perfect.

                                      C. Eight 50s. We take two of the 50s and have 100 and can do that four times. Then,
                                      we add the 40 and the 30 and we have our odd-lot.

                                      D. Forty-seven 10-share certificates. This is sort of like paying a $470 purchase with 47
                                      $10 bills—the cashier doesn’t like it, but it works. Here, we take 10 of the 10s and that
                                      is 100. We can do that four times. That leaves over seven 10-share certificates, which
                                      is our 70-share odd-lot.

           LESSON 17.4: TRANSACTION PROCESSING RULES AND REGULATIONS
                                         LO 17.d Determine the rules and regulations pertaining to processing transactions.



                                         Legal Requirements for Good Delivery
                                         In addition to the proper time and size, having the necessary documentation is a critical
                                         part of good delivery. In order for ownership to change hands, the certificate representing
                                         ownership must be negotiable. In a way, it is similar to depositing a check. If the check is not
                                         made out properly or signed (endorsed) with the proper name, the bank might not process it.
                                         Here are the major criteria that determine negotiability of certificates.


                                         Assignment
                                         Each stock and bond certificate must be assigned (endorsed by signature) by the owner(s)
                                         whose name is registered on the certificate’s face. Certificates registered in a joint name require
                                         all owners’ signatures.

                                         Endorsement by a customer may be made on the back of a certificate on the signature line or
                                         on a separate stock or bond power of substitution. One stock or bond power can be used with
                                         any number of certificates for one security, but a separate power is required for each security.


                                         Stock or Bond Power
                                         A stock power or bond power, often called a security power, is a legal document—separate
                                         from a securities certificate—that investors can use to transfer or assign ownership to another
                                         person. “Securities powers typically are used either: (1) as a matter of convenience when
                                         an owner cannot sign the actual certificates, or (2) for safety (such as sending unsigned
                                         certificates in one envelope and signed powers in another). Physically, a securities power
                                         looks like the backside of a securities certificate, and it can be completed in the same manner.
                                         Market professionals typically attach a customer’s signed powers to the related unsigned
                                         certificates for processing purposes.” —U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission


                                         Alteration
                                         If an alteration or a correction has been made to an assignment, a full explanation of the
                                         change signed by the person or firm who executed the correction must be attached.


                                         Signature Guarantee
                                         When customers hold securities in physical certificate form and want to transfer or sell them,
                                         they will need to sign the certificates or the securities powers mentioned earlier. In most cases,
                                         the signature(s) will need to be guaranteed before a transfer agent will accept the transaction.
                                         Although it is an inconvenience to get signatures guaranteed, the process protects customers
                                         by making it harder for people to steal their money by forging a signature on the securities
                                         certificates or powers.

                                        Medallion Signature Guarantee
                                        An investor can obtain a signature guarantee from a financial institution, such as a commercial
                                        bank, savings bank, credit union, or broker-dealer that participates in one of the Medallion
                                        signature guarantee programs.

                                        A Medallion imprint or stamp indicates that the financial institution is a member of
                                        a Medallion signature guarantee program and is an acceptable signature guarantor. By
                                        participating in the program, financial institutions can guarantee customer signatures with the
                                        assurance that their guarantees will be immediately accepted for processing by transfer agents.

                                        Signature Requirements
                                        A customer’s signature must match exactly the name registered on the security’s certificate.

                                                  TAKE NOTE
                                                  Regarding signature requirements for purposes of good delivery, the only two
                                                  acceptable abbreviations within a signature are Co. for the word company, and & for
                                                  the word and. No other abbreviations, such as Inc., or Corp., are permitted.


                                        Legal Transfer Items
                                        Any form of registration other than an individual or joint ownership may require supporting
                                        guarantees or documentation to render a certificate negotiable.

                                        For business registrations involving sole proprietorships or partnerships, a simple guarantee by
                                        a broker-dealer is usually sufficient. For corporate registrations and certificates in the names
                                        of fiduciaries, a transfer agent may require a corporate resolution naming the person signing
                                        a certificate as authorized to do so. Fiduciaries must supply either a certified copy of a trust
                                        agreement or a copy of a court appointment, depending on the type of fiduciary involved.


                                        Invalid Signatures
                                        If a broker-dealer guarantees a forged signature, such as that of a deceased person, the firm
                                        becomes liable. The executor or administrator of the estate must endorse the certificate or
                                        furnish a stock power and transfer the securities to the name of the estate before they can be
                                        sold. Minors’ signatures are invalid for securities registration purposes.

                                         Good Condition of Security
                                         If a certificate is mutilated or appears to be counterfeit, appropriate authentication must be
                                         obtained before a transfer agent can accept the security for replacement. If the damage is so
                                         extensive that the transfer agent doubts the certificate’s authenticity, it will require a surety
                                         bond from the seller. This is a form of insurance protecting the transfer agent from claims.


                                         CUSIP Regulations
                                         Committee on Uniform Securities Identification Procedures (CUSIP) numbers are used
                                         in all trade confirmations and correspondence regarding specific securities. A separate CUSIP
                                         number is assigned to each issue of securities; if an issue is subdivided into classes with
                                         differing characteristics, each class is assigned a separate CUSIP number. In general, a CUSIP
                                         number will aid in identifying and tracking a security throughout its life.


                                         Legal Opinion: Municipal Securities
                                         Unless a municipal bond is traded and stamped ex-legal (without a legal opinion), the legal
                                         opinion must be printed on or attached to the bond as evidence of the bond’s validity.
                                         Securities traded ex-legal are in good delivery condition without the legal opinion.


                                         Fail-to-Deliver
                                         A fail-to-deliver situation occurs when the broker-dealer on the sell side of a contract does
                                         not deliver the securities in good delivery form to the broker-dealer on the buy side on the
                                         settlement date.

                                         As long as a fail-to-deliver exists, the seller will not receive payment.

                                         In a fail-to-deliver situation, the buying broker-dealer may buy-in the securities to close the
                                         contract and may charge the seller for any loss caused by changes in the market. If a customer
                                         fails to deliver securities to satisfy a sale, the firm representing the seller must buy-in the
                                         securities after 10 business days from the settlement date.


                                         Reclamation
                                         Reclamation occurs when a buying broker-dealer, after accepting securities as good delivery,
                                         later discovers that the certificates were not in good deliverable form (e.g., certificates are
                                         mutilated). The securities can be sent back to the selling broker-dealer with a Uniform
                                         Reclamation Form attached within specific time frames, depending on the reason reclamation
                                         is being made.

                                                     TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                     There are two types of bond deliveries that are never subject to reclamation:
                                                     (1) bond certificates subject to an in-whole call and
                                                     (2) bonds where the issuer goes into default after the trade date.

                       PRACTICE QUESTION
                       7.   Instead of signing on the back of a certificate representing a security sold, the
                            registered owner could sign on a separate paper called
                              A. an endorsement.
                              B. a stock (or bond) power.
                              C. a proxy.
                              D. a stock split.
                            Answer: B. If the client were to assign the back of the certificate, that security would
                            now be completely negotiable. If lost, it would be the same as losing an endorsed
                            check. To minimize problems, make the assignment on a stock power, which is
                            a separate piece of paper, and when put together with the actual certificate, it is
                            treated as if the certificate itself had been signed.

              INTRODUCTION
                          As the old saying goes, “You can please some of the people all of the time, you can please all of
                          the people some of the time, but you can’t please all of the people all of the time.” It is rare that
                          even the most cautious registered representative doesn’t receive at least one customer complaint
                          during the many years of being registered. FINRA has established a lengthy procedure for
                          dealing with those complaints and the reporting obligations of member firms and their
                          associated persons.


              LESSON 18.1: REPORTING DISCIPLINARY INCIDENTS AND HANDLING
                           CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS

                          LO 18.a Identify Form U4 reporting requirements.


                          Form U4
                          Registration as an associated person of a FINRA member firm requires the filing of Form U4.
                          The information required on Form U4 is extensive and includes
                           name, address, and any aliases used;
                           five-year residency history;


                                                                                                                             473

                                        10-year employment history (verify the past three years); and
                                        disclosure of an charge or conviction for any felony or any securities-related misdemeanor.
                                       A yes answer to the final bullet point requires a detailed explanation on a DRP (disclosure
                                       reporting page).

                                       Any changes to this information require filing an amended form with the Central Registration
                                       Depository no later than 30 days after the member becomes aware of these changes.


                                       Qualifications Investigated
                                       Before submitting an application to register an individual with FINRA as a registered
                                       representative, a member firm must certify that it has investigated the person’s business
                                       reputation, character, education, qualifications, and experience, and that the candidate’s
                                       credentials are in order.

                                       If, during its routine review of Form U4, FINRA discovers that any portion of the
                                       information submitted, especially relating to personal history and past disciplinary or law
                                       enforcement encounters, is misleading or omits material information, disciplinary action may
                                       be taken, resulting in a bar to the individual. In addition, the principal signing the application
                                       may be liable as well.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   It is not necessary to update Form U4 to note educational achievements or changes to
                                                   marital status.


                                       DRPs
                                       The DRPs can be the scariest part of Form U4. Depending on your personal history, they can
                                       contain nothing, or can be many pages long. The disclosures are not limited to the securities
                                       industry. FINRA breaks them down into these six categories:
                                        Criminal disclosure
                                         – Felony and certain financially related misdemeanors
                                        Regulatory action disclosure
                                         – SEC, state regulators, SRO
                                        Civil judicial disclosure
                                         – Civil cases not involving securities
                                        Customer complaint/arbitration/civil litigation disclosure
                                         – Customer complaints
                                        Termination disclosure
                                         – Terminations for cause

                       LO 18.b Relate the procedure for addressing customer complaints.



                       Customer Complaint Procedures
                       Although each member firm must establish its own procedures, there are common elements to
                       all. First of all, we need to define a customer complaint. Here is FINRA’s definition:


                                                                                                                                   Unit 18
                            For purposes of Rule 4513, “customer complaint” means any grievance by a
                            customer or any person authorized to act on behalf of the customer involving the
                            activities of the member or a person associated with the member in connection with
                            the solicitation or execution of any transaction or the disposition of securities or
                            funds of that customer.

                       FINRA then describes the proper recording of the complaint like this:
                       “Each member shall keep and preserve a separate file of all written customer complaints and
                       action taken by the member, if any. Customer complaint records shall be preserved for a
                       period of at least four years.”

                       The key takeaways are
                        a complaint is only a complaint if it is in writing, and
                        complaint records are retained for a minimum of four years.


                       When Complaints are Received
                       If the complaint is received by the registered representative, it must be immediately brought to
                       the attention of the person designated in the member’s written procedures manual. That could
                       be the branch manager or perhaps someone in the firm’s legal department.

                       If a complaint about a registered representative is received by the broker-dealer, the most
                       common procedure is to discuss it with the rep first before contacting the customer. Efforts
                       are made to solve the complaint without taking it through FINRA’s formal procedures. If that
                       can’t be done, mediation or arbitration is usually the next step.

                                                    2.   There are different record retention requirements for different records. Under FINRA
                                                         Rule 4513, how long must a FINRA member firm keep a record of written customer
                                                         complaints?
                                                          A. One year
                                                          B. Four years
                                                          C. Six years
                                                          D. Lifetime of the customer’s account
                                                         Answer: B. According to FINRA Rule 4513, written customer complaints and any
                                                         correspondence related to the complaints have a record retention requirement of
                                                         four years.


           LESSON 18.2: FINRA’S COMPLAINT RESOLUTION METHODS AND RULES

                                        LO 18.c Determine the methods of resolution.



                                        Code of Arbitration Procedure
                                        Arbitration is an alternative to going to court to resolve disputes. According to the American
                                        Bar Association, “Arbitration is a private process where disputing parties agree that one or
                                        several individuals can make a decision about the dispute after receiving evidence and hearing
                                        arguments.”

                                        The FINRA Code of Arbitration Procedure was originally established to arbitrate unresolved
                                        industry disputes. It was mandatory in controversies involving
                                         a member against another member or registered clearing agency,
                                         a member against an associated person, and
                                         an associated person against another associated person.
                                        Over time, customer complaints became subject to mandatory arbitration resulting in two
                                        codes: the Customer Code and the Industry Code.

                                        Today, virtually all new account forms contain a predispute arbitration clause that must
                                        be signed by customers before account opening. Thus, assuming the customer has signed
                                        the arbitration agreement or the new account form containing the predispute arbitration
                                        agreement, unresolved customer complaints must be arbitrated under the Code of Arbitration.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    In the absence of a signed arbitration agreement, a customer can still force a member
                                                    to arbitration, but a member cannot force a customer to arbitration.
                                        Class action claims are not subject to arbitration. In addition, claims alleging employment
                                        discrimination brought against a member firm by its own employees, including sexual
                                        harassment claims, are not required to be arbitrated unless the parties agree.

                                        The advantages of arbitration over suits in state or federal courts are savings of time, money,
                                        and the fact that all decisions are final and binding; no appeals are allowed. One party may
                                        not like the result, but the dispute is settled.

                                 TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                 If a customer requests to see the predispute arbitration agreement she has signed, a
                                 member firm must supply her with a copy within 10 business days of the request.


                       Initiation of Proceedings
                       Any party to an unresolved dispute may initiate proceedings by filing a claim with the director
                       of arbitration of FINRA. The statement of claim must describe in detail the controversy in
                       dispute, include documentation in support of the claim, and state the remedy being sought (a
                       dollar amount). The claimant must also include a check for the required claim filing fee. The
                       director will then send a copy of the claim to the other party (respondent).

                       The respondent then has 45 calendar days to respond to both the director and the claimant.
                       The answer must specify all available defenses and any related counterclaim the respondent
                       may have against the claimant. A respondent who fails to answer within 45 days may, at the
                       sole discretion of the director, be barred from presenting any matter, arguments, or defenses at
                       the hearing.

                       If the dispute involves irreparable injury to one of the parties, that party may seek an interim
                       injunction or a permanent injunction. The party seeking relief must make a clear showing
                       that its case is likely to succeed on its merits and that it will suffer permanent harm unless
                       immediate relief is granted.


                       Mediation

                                                                                                                                   Unit 18
                       An alternate dispute resolution process and a reasonable, inexpensive first step is mediation.

                       If both parties agree, before the opening of hearings, a meeting may be held in an attempt
                       to work out a settlement. A mediator is selected to preside over the discussions and to assist
                       the parties, if possible, in reaching their own solution. If mediation is unsuccessful, a hearing
                       is conducted. A mediator is prohibited from serving on an arbitration panel regarding any
                       matter in which that person served as mediator. Sometimes, parts of a dispute settle in
                       mediation, leaving fewer differences to be settled in arbitration, which can translate into
                       savings of time and money. The issue is settled when the memo of understanding is signed.

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 Once mediation begins, either party may withdraw at any time without the consent of
                                 the mediator or the other party.


                       Selection of Arbitrators
                       FINRA maintains a list of arbitrators divided into two categories: nonpublic and public.

                       Nonpublic arbitrators are as follows:
                        Any persons who worked in the financial industry for any duration during their careers,
                         including persons associated with a mutual fund or a hedge fund, and persons associated
                         with an investment adviser, will always be classified as nonpublic arbitrators.
                        Any financial industry professional who regularly represents or provides services to
                         investor parties in disputes concerning investment accounts or transactions including
                         attorneys, accountants, or other professionals whose firms earned significant revenue
                         from representing individual and/or institutional investors relating to securities matters
                         are classified as nonpublic arbitrators. However, for these individuals, waiting five years

                                             (cooling-off period) after ending the affiliation based on their own activities, or two years
                                             after ending an affiliation based on someone else’s activities, reclassifies and allows them to
                                             serve as public arbitrators.

                                        Public arbitrators are as follows:
                                         Any persons who do not meet the definition of a nonpublic arbitrator may serve as a
                                          public arbitrator.


                                        Arbitration Thresholds and Simplified Arbitration
                                        For both the customer and the industry codes, the following threshold rules apply:
                                         $50,000 or less—one arbitrator
                                         $50,000–$100,000—one arbitrator unless both parties agree to three
                                         Greater than $100,000—three arbitrators unless both parties agree to one
                                        Any dispute involving a dollar amount of $50,000 or less is eligible for simplified arbitration.
                                        In this instance, a single arbitrator reviews all of the evidence and renders a binding decision
                                        within 30 business days.


                                        Composition of the Panel
                                        We don’t expect the exam to get this deep, but when the case involves a member of the public,
                                        the case is heard by a public arbitrator if only one. If there are three, a majority will be public.
                                        And, if requested, the panel can be three public arbitrators.

                                        If the case is strictly between members and does not involve a statutory discrimination claim,
                                        all panel members are nonpublic. In cases involving an associated person, public arbitrators
                                        are on the panel as well.


                                        Awards
                                        All monetary awards must be paid within 30 days of the decision date. Any award not paid
                                        within this time will begin to accrue interest as of the decision date. In addition, all awards
                                        and details on the underlying arbitration claim are made publicly available by FINRA.


                                        Statute of Limitations
                                        No claim is eligible for submission to arbitration if six years or more have elapsed from the
                                        time of the event giving rise to the claim.

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                    3.   A dispute involving a dollar amount of $50,000 or less is eligible for

                                      Answer: D. Any dispute involving a dollar amount of $50,000 or less is eligible for
                                      simplified arbitration. In this instance, a single arbitrator reviews all the evidence
                                      and renders a binding decision within 30 business days. It would be eligible for
                                      mediation, not remediation. It is too small for a panel of three arbitrators. One of the
                                      features of arbitration is that there are no appeals; the decision is final and binding.


                       LO 18.d Determine the rules and regulations pertaining to complaint resolution.



                       The Code of Procedure (COP)
                       For trade practice violations, FINRA follows the Code of Procedure (COP). Unlike the Code
                       of Arbitration Procedure that deals with disputes, the initials COP in a test question are a clue
                       that there has been a violation of the rules—someone has broken the law. As we will learn
                       next, penalties for violating the rules can be severe.


                       Availability of Manual to Customers
                       Customers might not know their rights, so FINRA Rule 8110 has an interesting requirement.
                       Members must make available a current copy of the FINRA Manual for examination by
                       customers upon request. It used to be that firms had to maintain an inventory of the FINRA
                       manuals. In keeping with modernity, members may comply with this rule by maintaining
                       electronic access to the FINRA Manual and providing customers with such access upon
                       request. This is done by having a hyperlink to the FINRA website.

                                                                                                                                      Unit 18
                       Reporting Requirements
                       The reporting requirements of FINRA Rule 4530 demand that a member firm promptly
                       report to FINRA, but in any event not later than 30 calendar days, after the member knows
                       (or should have known) that members or associated persons of the member
                        have been found to have violated federal securities law;
                        are subject to a customer complaint alleging theft, misappropriation of customer assets, or
                         forgery;
                        have been suspended or expelled by another SRO;
                        are indicted, convicted, or plead guilty or no contest to any criminal offense (other than
                         traffic violations);
                        become a defendant or respondent in any securities- or commodities-related litigation or
                         arbitration settled for an amount in excess of $15,000 ($25,000 if the defendant/respon­
                         dent is the member firm itself );
                        become subject to a statutory disqualification; or
                        are the subject of in-house disciplinary action involving suspension, termination, with­
                         holding of commissions, or fines in excess of $2,500.


                       Sanctions
                       Sanctions against a member or associated person found in violation of securities laws and rules
                       are included with the written decision. Under FINRA Rule 8300, sanctions could include one
                       or more of the following:

                                         Fine
                                         Suspension of the membership of a member or suspension of the registration of an associ­
                                          ated person for up to two years
                                         Expulsion of the member, cancelation of the membership of the member, or revocation or
                                          cancelation of the registration of an associated person
                                         Barring a member or associated person from association with all members
                                         Any other fitting sanction
                                        If an associated person is suspended, that person cannot remain associated with the member
                                        in any capacity, including a clerical or administrative capacity (during the suspension period,
                                        that person cannot remain on the member’s premises). The member is prohibited from paying
                                        a sal­ary, commission, or other remuneration that the person might have earned during the
                                        suspension period. The suspended person may be paid monies earned before the suspension
                                        period. When a member firm is suspended, the firm is treated like a nonmember in any
                                        dealings with members. Essentially, this means no participation in underwritings and no
                                        member-to-member pricing.


                                        Appeals
                                        If either side is displeased with the decision, an appeal may be made to the National
                                        Adjudicatory Council (NAC). Any appeal must be made within 25 days of the decision date;
                                        otherwise, the decision is final. If no satisfaction is received from the NAC, the appealing
                                        party may take the case to the SEC. Again, if turned down, the appealing party has the right
                                        to continue the appeal process by taking its case to the federal court system. Appealing a
                                        decision stays the effective date of any sanctions other than a bar or expulsion.

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                    4.   As a result of a disciplinary infraction, FINRA has suspended a member for 3 months.
                                                         During this period, the member shall
                                                          A. have no securities dealings of any kind.
                                                          B. be treated as a nonmember by other members.
                                                          C. restrict activities with customers solely to investment companies.
                                                          D. restrict activities with member firms solely to investment banking.
                                                         Answer: B. A suspended member is considered a nonmember firm while the
                                                         suspension is in effect. There is no restriction on activity, but everything is done on a
                                                         retail basis, substantially reducing any income for the firm.


                                        Clearly Erroneous Transactions
                                        Under Rules 11892 and 11893, Nasdaq has the authority to declare any interdealer trade null
                                        and void or adjust the terms of any interdealer trade if the terms of the trade are clearly in
                                        error (e.g., obvious error in price, number of shares). Nasdaq can take these actions on its own
                                        or in response to a complaint from a member.

                       If a member wants to have a trade nullified or adjusted, it must notify Nasdaq Market
                       Operations within 30 minutes of the execution and provide all the details surrounding the
                       trade. After review, Nasdaq will make a decision to
                        void the trade,
                        adjust the terms of the trade, or
                        take no action.
                       The rules apply to any OTC transaction involving an exchange-listed security (11892) and
                       any transaction involving an OTC equity security (11893). FINRA notes that it is less likely
                       to take action when the report is about an OTC equity security because aberrant trading in
                       the OTC equity market is often due to issues other than systems problems or extraordinary
                       events.

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 5.   If a member wishes to appeal an adverse decision in a Code of Procedure (COP)
                                      hearing, the member must appeal to the National Adjudicatory Council (NAC) within
                                      how many days of the decision date?
                                        A. 25
                                        B. 30

                                        D. 45
                                      Answer: A. If either side is displeased with a COP decision, an appeal must be made
                                      within 25 days of the decision date.

              INTRODUCTION
                         Broker-dealers communicate with the public for two major reasons. First, as with most
                         businesses, it pays to advertise. That is, if potential clients don’t know who you are, they won’t
                         come knocking on your door. Then, once you have obtained the clients, good communications
                         are necessary to keep them. On the exam, both objectives are addressed. Having gotten this far
                         in the course, we do not expect you to be surprised that there are many regulations covering
                         these communications. Almost everything in this unit is drawn from FINRA Rule 2210. It is
                         doubtful you will need to remember that number.

           486         Unit 19   Communications With the Public



           LESSON 19.1: TYPES OF COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE PUBLIC
                                        LO 19.a Compare the three main types of communications with the public, their
                                        characteristics, and definitions.

                                        In Rule 2210, FINRA has taken the federal requirements on communications with the
                                        public and expanded on them in its conduct rules. These rules require that all members
                                        observe high standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade. It is
                                        strictly prohibited to make use of any manipulative, deceptive, or other fraudulent devices or
                                        contrivances when conducting business with the public.

                                        FINRA and SEC rules deal with communications concerning a member’s investment banking
                                        or securities business. A registered principal must be familiar with the standards for content,
                                        supervisory review and approval, and recordkeeping for such material.

                                        FINRA provides definitions and categories that differentiate the various types of
                                        communications for which the principal is responsible.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    When we get to the specific review and approvals, you will need to know that general
                                                    securities principals (Series 24) may review and/or approve communications for
                                                    all securities except options. Limited securities principals (Series 26) may only
                                                    review and/or approve communications for investment company products. Options
                                                    communications generally need review or approval from an ROP (Series 4).
                                        The definitions of communication with the public are classified into correspondence, retail
                                        communications, and institutional communications.

                                        The application of the rules differs depending on the category of a particular communication.
                                        For this reason, you must be able to determine what fits where.


                                        Correspondence
                                        Correspondence is written or electronic communication that is distributed or made available
                                        to 25 or fewer retail investors within any 30 calendar-day period. FINRA means this to
                                        include current and prospective customers.

                                        Each member must establish written procedures that are appropriate to its business, size,
                                        structure, and customers for the review of incoming and outgoing correspondence with
                                        the public. This includes procedures to review incoming correspondence directed to
                                        registered representatives. Firms need to be able to properly identify and handle customer
                                        complaints and to ensure that customer funds and securities are handled in accordance with
                                        firm procedures. Procedures may allow for either pre- or post-review of correspondence
                                        by a principal. When pre-review is not required, the firm must include a provision for
                                        the education and training of associated persons as to the firm’s procedures governing
                                        correspondence. These procedures must include documentation of such education and
                                        training, and surveillance and follow-up to ensure that such procedures are implemented and
                                        adhered to. Evidence that these supervisory procedures have been implemented and carried
                                        out must be maintained and made available to FINRA upon request.

                      Retail Communication
                      Retail communication is defined in FINRA Rule 2210 as “any written (including electronic)
                      communication that is distributed or made available to more than 25 retail investors within
                      any 30 calendar-day period.” What would commonly be thought of as advertisements and sales
                      literature generally fall under this definition. Some specific examples of retail communication
                      would include
                       telemarketing or other sales scripts (if expected to be used with more than 25
                        noninstitutional investors within a 30-day period);
                       posts to an interactive electronic forum (e.g., social media updates);
                       a storyboard of a television or video ad; and
                       independently prepared reprints.
                      What is a retail investor? Any person—other than an institutional investor—regardless of
                      whether the person has an account with any firm is considered a retail investor. With a few
                      exceptions (which will follow), an appropriately qualified registered principal of the member
                      must approve each retail communication before the earlier of its use or filing with FINRA’s
                      Advertising Regulation Department.

                      The requirement to have a principal approve retail communication does not apply if, at the
                      time that a member intends to distribute it
                       another member has filed it with FINRA’s advertising department and has received a letter
                        from the department stating that it appears to be consistent with applicable standards,
                       the member using it in reliance upon the letter has not materially altered it and will use it
                        in a manner that is consistent with the conditions of the department’s letter,
                       if it is a post to an interactive electronic forum.
                      The requirement of prior principal approval generally will not apply with regard to any retail
                      communication that does not make any financial or investment recommendation or otherwise
                      promote a product or service of the member.

                      FINRA may also grant an exception from the approval rule for good cause. Notwithstanding
                      any other exception, an appropriately qualified registered principal of the member must
                      approve each retail communication before the earlier of its use or filing with FINRA.

                                TEST TOPIC ALERT                                                                                 Unit 19
                                Please note that the term retail customer refers to any customer—existing or
                                prospective—that does not fit into the definition of institutional client.


                      Institutional Communication
                      Institutional communication is any written communication that is distributed or made
                      available only to institutional accounts but does not include a member firm’s internal
                      communications.

                      Keep in mind that when regulators talk about written communication, they always include
                      electronic communications too.

                      For purposes of this Rule, the term “institutional account” shall mean the account of any:
                       Bank
                       Savings and loan association

                                         Insurance company
                                         Registered investment company
                                         Registered investment adviser (SEC or state-registered)
                                         Any entity with $50 million or more of total assets, including natural persons
                                        This definition is important because any entity that isn’t defined as an institution is retail.
                                        The rule specifically excludes the individual participants of employee benefit plans from the
                                        definition of institutional investors.

                                        If a member has reason to believe that a communication or excerpt of the communication
                                        intended for institutional investors will be forwarded to or made available to a person who is
                                        not an institutional investor, the communication must be treated as a retail communication
                                        until the member reasonably concludes the improper practice has ceased.

                                        Each member must establish written procedures that are appropriate to its business, size,
                                        structure, and customers for the review of institutional communications used by the
                                        member and its associated persons by an appropriately qualified, registered principal. Such
                                        procedures must be reasonably designed to ensure that institutional communications comply
                                        with applicable standards. When such procedures do not require review of all institutional
                                        communications before first use or distribution, they must include provision for the
                                        education and training of associated persons as to the firm’s procedures governing institutional
                                        communications, documentation of such education and training, and surveillance and follow-
                                        up to ensure that such procedures are implemented and adhered to. Evidence that these
                                        supervisory procedures have been implemented and carried out must be maintained and made
                                        available to FINRA upon request.

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                    1.   Institutional communication is defined as sales material
                                                           A. received from a mutual fund or other institutional investor.
                                                           B. sent only to an institutional investor.
                                                           C. sent to both institutional investors and the general public.
                                                           D. sent to an institutional investor for forwarding to its public clients.
                                                         Answer: B. To qualify as institutional communication, the material can only be
                                                         seen by institutions. If the broker-dealer receives any hints that the communication
                                                         may be passed on from the institution to a retail investor, it will likely fall out of the
                                                         definition and require approvals.

                                        Other Communications
                                        In addition to the three primary types of communications with the public, there are several
                                        other types of communications you should be aware of.

                       Public Appearance
                       A public appearance is participation in a seminar, webinar, radio or television interview,
                       or other public appearance or public-speaking activity. To qualify, it must be an activity
                       that is unscripted and could not be classified as correspondence, retail, or institutional
                       communication.

                       Members must establish written procedures that are appropriate to their business, business’s
                       size, structure, and customers to supervise their associated persons’ public appearances.
                       Therefore, preapproval of a principal may be required but is not mandated. Such procedures
                       must provide for the education and training of associated persons who make public
                       appearances as to the firm’s procedures, documentation of such education and training, and
                       surveillance and follow-up to ensure that such procedures are implemented and adhered to.
                       Evidence that these supervisory procedures have been implemented and carried out must be
                       maintained and made available to FINRA upon request.

                       Any scripts, slides, handouts, or other written (including electronic) materials used in
                       connection with public appearances are considered communications for purposes of this
                       rule, and members must comply with all applicable provisions of this rule based on those
                       communications’ audience, content, and use. If the material will be seen by more than 25
                       investors in a 30-day period, it is considered retail communication. In that case, it must have
                       preapproval from a principal unless meeting one of the exceptions mentioned previously.

                       If an associated person recommends a security in a public appearance, the associated person
                       must have a reasonable basis for the recommendation. The associated person also must
                       disclose any conflicts of interest that may exist, such as a financial interest in any security
                       being recommended. This disclosure is not required when the security recommended is a
                       mutual fund or variable contract of an insurance company. If past performance of a mutual
                       fund or variable contract is shown, it must be for no less than the previous 12 months.

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 2.   Which of the following would meet FINRA’s definition of a public appearance?
                                       A. A carefully scripted presentation in an online interactive electronic forum, such
                                           as a chat room or in an online seminar
                                       B. An unscripted presentation in an online interactive electronic forum, such as a
                                           chat room or in an online seminar

                                                                                                                                    Unit 19
                                       C. An unscripted presentation to over 1,000 registered representatives through
                                           the member firm’s internal broadcasting facilities
                                       D. A brochure describing the features offered by the member firm that includes a
                                           link to a specially prepared video on the member’s website
                                      Answer: B. To be a public appearance, it must be unscripted and for the public, not
                                      a group of registered representatives. Brochures, even those with video links, are
                                      invariably going to be retail communications.


                       Independently Prepared Reprint
                       Independently prepared reprints are retail communications and have some special
                       characteristics that generate exam questions. An independently prepared reprint (IPR)
                       consists of any article reprint that meets certain standards. A key requirement is that the
                       reprint was prepared by an independent publisher and was not materially altered by the
                       member. A member may alter the contents of an IPR only to make it consistent with
                       applicable regulatory standards or to correct factual errors.

           490        Unit 19   Communications With the Public



                                       An article reprint qualifies as an IPR under the rules only if, among other things, its publisher
                                       is not an affiliate of the member using the reprint or any underwriter or issuer of the security
                                       mentioned in the reprint. Also, neither the member using the reprint nor any underwriter
                                       or issuer of a security mentioned in the reprint may have commissioned the reprinted
                                       article. IPRs must be preapproved by a principal and are exempted from the FINRA filing
                                       requirements. A member firm acting as manager or co-manager of a securities offering may
                                       not publish research and the firm’s analyst may not make a public appearance regarding the
                                       subject company for a minimum of 10 calendar days following the effective date of an initial
                                       public offering (IPO), or for three calendar days following an additional issue (secondary)
                                       offering.

                                       Often investment bankers set a longer quiet period such as 25 days to coincide with the
                                       obligation to deliver a prospectus.


                                       Research Reports
                                       A research report is a document prepared by an analyst or strategist, typically as a part
                                       of a research team for an investment adviser or broker-dealer. The report may focus on an
                                       individual stock or sector of the economy and generally, but not always, will recommend
                                       buying, selling, or holding an investment.

                                       FINRA has established rules designed to improve the objectivity of research reports and
                                       provide investors with more useful and reliable information when making investment
                                       decisions.

                                       Members must take steps to ensure that all research reports reflect an analyst’s honest view
                                       and that any recommendation is not influenced by conflicts of interest, such as investment
                                       banking business (see Unit 20) with the issuer. If a member issues a report or a research
                                       analyst renders an opinion that is inconsistent with the analyst’s actual views regarding a
                                       subject company, FINRA considers such action fraudulent.

                                       To ensure the investing public receives objective information from the media and
                                       publications, the FINRA rules require the following:
                                        Firms must clearly explain their rating systems, use rating terms according to their plain
                                         meaning, note the percentage of all ratings they have assigned to each category (e.g., buy/
                                         sell/hold), and document the percentage of investment banking clients in each category.
                                        Analysts’ compensation may not be tied to the firm’s investment banking revenues.
                                        Analysts must disclose in their research reports and public appearances whether they
                                         or any member of their households have a financial interest in the subject security and
                                         whether their employer firms owned 1% or more of any class of a subject company’s
                                         equity securities at the close of the previous month.
                                        Research reports must disclose whether, within the last 12 months, the firm has received
                                         fees for investment banking services from—or managed or co-managed—a public offering
                                         for a company that is the subject of a research report. They must also disclose whether the
                                         firm expects to receive or intends to seek in the three months following publication of a
                                         research report any investment banking fees from any company that is the subject of a
                                         report.
                                        An investment adviser or a broker-dealer may not present to a client research reports,
                                         analyses, or recommendations prepared by other persons or firms without disclosing the
                                         fact that the adviser or broker-dealer did not prepare them. An investment adviser or a
                                         broker-dealer may base a recommendation on reports or analyses prepared by others, as
                                         long as these reports are not represented as the investment adviser’s or broker-dealer’s
                                         own.

                      Quiet Period
                      FINRA interprets the date of the offering to be the later of the effective date of the registration
                      statement or the first date on which the securities were bona fide offered to the public.

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 The following items fall outside the definition of research reports:
                                     Discussions of broad-based indices
                                     Commentaries on economic, political, or market conditions
                                     Technical analyses concerning the demand and supply for a sector, index, or
                                      industry based on trading volume and price
                                     Statistical summaries of multiple companies’ financial data, including listings of
                                      current ratings
                                     Notices of ratings or price target changes

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 3.   Which of the following requires that the communication was issued by an
                                      independent publisher and not materially altered by the member?
                                        A. A research report
                                        B. An independently prepared reprint (IPR)
                                        C. A website article
                                        D. A script for a public appearance
                                      Answer: B. An IPR consists of any article reprint that meets certain standards
                                      designed to ensure that the reprint was issued by an independent publisher and was
                                      not materially altered by the member.


                      Electronic Communications With the Public
                      Although not classified as a specific type of communication, with the growth of the internet
                      and the rise of electronic communications in general, it has been necessary for FINRA to
                      bring electronic communications in the securities industry into the regulatory framework.

                      Websites, whether sponsored by the company itself or set up by an individual registered

                                                                                                                                   Unit 19
                      representative, are considered retail communications and are subject to applicable filing and
                      recordkeeping rules. They must be reviewed and approved by a principal before first use and
                      must contain no exaggerated claims or misleading information, and if materially altered since
                      the last filing, must be reapproved and refiled. There must also be nothing in the website that
                      suggests business affiliation with or approval by FINRA.

                      Members may indicate FINRA membership on a member’s website, provided that the
                      member provides a hyperlink to FINRA’s homepage—www.finra.org—in close proximity
                      to the member’s indication of FINRA membership. This provision also applies to a website
                      relating to the member’s investment banking or securities business maintained by or on behalf
                      of any person associated with a member.

                      Electronic bulletin boards are also considered retail communications, but a registered
                      representative using one, or a chat room, need not identify himself as a registered person. Use
                      of an online interactive forum by a registered representative must be approved by a principal,
                      although each post does not require principal approval. The communications must be held to
                      normal standards of accuracy and completeness.

                                       Individual emails to customers fall under the definition of correspondence and are subject to
                                       the appropriate standards of conduct and supervision. Instant messaging could qualify as retail
                                       communication or correspondence, depending on the size of the audience.

                                       FINRA has released several notices dealing with the use of social media, such as Facebook and
                                       Twitter. We have learned of a few questions on the topic and they are included in our QBank.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   Regulations are clear—firms must have established procedures to maintain, review,
                                                   and supervise communications transmitted via blogs, email, instant messaging, texts,
                                                   Twitter, Facebook, and whatever new communication forum is coming our way.
                                                   Recently, a firm and some representatives were fined when it was discovered that reps
                                                   had used outside electronic sources for securities-related business. In other words,
                                                   there was no supervision, no review, and no record of the communication. FINRA does
                                                   not look kindly on that.


                                       SEC Advertising Rules
                                       The SEC has two rules regarding advertising that can appear on the exam. They are Rule 135a
                                       dealing with generic advertising and Rule 156, titled Investment Company Sales Literature.


                                       Generic Advertising SEC Rule 135A
                                       Generic advertising promotes securities as an investment medium, but does not refer to any
                                       specific security. Generic advertising often includes information about
                                        the securities investments that companies offer,
                                        the nature of investment companies,
                                        services offered in connection with the described securities,
                                        explanations of the various types of investment companies,
                                        descriptions of exchange and reinvestment privileges, and
                                        where the public can write or call for further information.
                                       All generic advertisements must contain the name and address of the sponsor of the
                                       advertisement but never include the name of any specific security. A generic advertisement
                                       may be placed only by a firm that offers the type of security or service described.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   Firms must have available for sale the type of security or service they advertise. For
                                                   example, a brokerage firm is not permitted to advertise no-load mutual funds if it does
                                                   not sell them.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   A broker-dealer may place an advertisement announcing mutual funds are now
                                                   offered, but may not provide the name of the mutual fund family or families offered.
                                                   In other words, if the advertisement states that the broker-dealer now offers FLY FAR
                                                   mutual funds, this would not be defined as a generic advertisement.

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 4.   If a firm wanted to promote securities as an investment medium but does not refer to
                                      any specific security, it would likely use which of the following?
                                        A. Generic advertising
                                        B. An independent generic research report
                                        C. A generic website post
                                        D. A public correspondence
                                      Answer: A. All generic advertisements must contain the name and address of the
                                      sponsor of the advertisement but never include the name of any specific security.


                       Rule 156
                       Under federal law, it is unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of any means
                       or instrumentality of interstate commerce or of the mails, to use sales literature which is
                       materially misleading in connection with the offer or sale of securities issued by an investment
                       company. Under these provisions, sales literature is materially misleading if it (1) contains an
                       untrue statement of a material fact or (2) omits to state a material fact necessary to make a
                       statement made, in the light of the circumstances of its use, not misleading.


                       Performance Reporting
                       Probably the most common offense deals with performance. Representations about past or
                       future investment performance could be misleading because of statements or omissions made
                       involving a material fact. Per SEC Rule 156, examples of these would include
                        representations implying that future gain or income may be inferred from or predicted
                         based on past investment performance;
                        portrayals of past performance, made in a manner which would imply that gains or
                         income realized in the past would be repeated in the future;
                        failure to disclose, if a sales load or any other nonrecurring fee is charged, the maximum
                         amount of the load or fee. If the sales load or fee is not reflected, a statement that the
                         performance data does not reflect the deduction of the sales load or fee, and that, if
                         reflected, the load or fee would reduce the performance quoted.

                       In any sales literature for an investment company, other than a money market fund, that

                                                                                                                                    Unit 19
                       contains performance data, average annual total return (after taxes on distributions, as well
                       as after taxes on distributions and redemption) for one-, five-, and 10-year periods must be
                       shown. If the fund has been in operation for a shorter period, the life of the fund must be
                       used. Longer periods may be shown in five-year increments up to the life of the fund.
                       If the sales literature refers to yield, it must include the total return figures and show the CY
                       in no greater size or prominence than total return. The quotation must also identify the length
                       of the period quoted and the last day in the base period used in the computation.

                       Some municipal bond funds like to advertise a tax-equivalent yield. To do so, they must
                       show both the CY and total return as earlier in addition, and the tax-equivalent yield may be
                       set out in no greater prominence. And, as stated previously, if the fund carries a sales load,
                       performance data must indicate the effect of the load.

                                       Names Rule
                                       Section 35(d) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 addresses certain broad categories
                                       of investment company names that are likely to mislead investors about an investment
                                       company’s investments and risks. The name rule requires a registered investment company
                                       with a name suggesting that the company focuses on a particular type of investment (e.g., an
                                       investment company that calls itself the ABC Stock Fund, the XYZ Bond Fund, or the QRS
                                       U.S. Government Fund) to invest at least 80% of its assets in the type of investment suggested
                                       by its name.

                                       In addition, under SEC Rule 482, any advertisement, pamphlet, circular, form letter, or other
                                       sales literature addressed to or intended for distribution to prospective investors is considered
                                       materially misleading unless the sales literature includes the following information.

                                             An investment in the Fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit
                                             Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although the Fund seeks to
                                             preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money
                                             by investing in the Fund.


           LESSON 19.2: REVIEW, APPROVAL, AND FILING OF COMMUNICATIONS

                                       LO 19.c Classify the required approvals of public communications including
                                       reviews and education of personnel.



                                       Required Approvals of Public Communications
                                       A principal of your firm may be required to approve or review communications to the public.
                                       Here are the requirements.
                                        Institutional—No preapproval of a principal is required. When such procedures do not
                                         require review of all institutional communications before first use or distribution, they
                                         must include provision for the education and training of associated persons as to the firm’s
                                         procedures governing institutional communications.
                                        Retail—Preapproval of a principal is required (before use).
                                        Correspondence—Pre- or post-review of a principal is required (reviewed before or after
                                         use).
                                        Public appearance—Preapproval of a principal may be required but is not mandated.
                                        Independently prepared reprints—These must be preapproved by a principal if the
                                         communication meets the definition of a retail communication.
                                        Research reports—Approval requirements are based on how they are defined (e.g.,
                                         institutional, retail). Research reports must be preapproved by a principal if the
                                         communication meets the definition of a retail communication.
                                        Electronic communications
                                         – Website preapproval of a principal is required.
                                            –    Electronic bulletin boards—Use of an online interactive forum by a registered
                                                 representative must be approved by a principal, although each post does not require
                                                 principal approval.

                          –   Emails and instant messaging—Approval requirements are based on how they are
                              defined (institutional, retail, or correspondence).
                          –   Generic advertising—Preapproval of a principal is required.


                      Filing Requirements
                      There is a special filing requirement for new members of FINRA. For a period of one year
                      beginning on the date reflected in the Central Registration Depository (CRD®) system as
                      the date that FINRA membership became effective, the new member must file any retail
                      communication with FINRA at least 10 business days before first use. This is called prefiling.
                      When FINRA says any, they mean any retail communication published or used in any
                       electronic or other public media, including any generally accessible website;
                       newspaper;
                       magazine or other periodical;
                       radio, television, telephone or audio recording;
                       video display, signs or billboards, motion pictures; or
                       telephone directories (other than routine listings).
                      After the first year of registration, a member firm is now established. From this point, the firm
                      may file retail communications within 10 business days of first use (postfiling).

                                TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                Whether a first-year firm or not, retail communications for investment companies
                                (including mutual funds, variable contracts, and unit investment trusts) that include
                                a ranking or a comparison that is generally not published or is the creation of the
                                investment company or the member must be filed with FINRA at least 10 business
                                days before first use (prefiling).
                                In addition, there is a 10-day prefiling requirement for any retail communication
                                involving option contracts (for all members).
                                If the ranking or comparison is generally published or is the creation of an
                                independent entity (e.g., Lipper or Morningstar), the usual filing rules for filing will
                                apply (i.e., within 10 business days of first use [postfiling]).
                      Retail communications must be kept on file for three years from last use. This includes                      Unit 19
                      electronic as well as paper format.

                                PRACTICE QUESTION
                                5.   When comparing the types of communication, which of the following require prior
                                     principal approval before use?
                                      A. Sending a letter to a pension plan with a recommendation for the purchase of
                                           a security
                                      B. The broker-dealer sending a letter to all existing clients promoting a new
                                           service it offers
                                      C. Sending a summary of a recent meeting to an institutional client
                                      D. Notifying all existing clients of a change of location

                                                         Answer: B. Sending notification to all existing clients at a broker-dealer would
                                                         involve more than 25 retail investors in a 30-calendar-day period. This would define
                                                         it as retail communication and require prior principal approval. It is the best answer
                                                         from the choices given. Institutional communications don’t require prior principal
                                                         approval and notifying clients of a change of address is not considered a retail
                                                         communication requiring approval.


           LESSON 19.3: PRODUCT SPECIFIC COMMUNICATIONS

                                        LO 19.d Identify procedures for product-specific advertisements and disclosures
                                        required for public use.



                                        Product-Specific Advertisements and Disclosures
                                        All of a member’s communications with the public—institutional, retail, and
                                        correspondence—must be based on principles of fair dealing and good faith and provide a
                                        sound basis for evaluating the facts in regard to any particular security or type of security,
                                        industry discussed, or service offered.

                                        No material fact or qualification may be omitted if it could cause the communication to be
                                        misleading. Although most of these standards apply to all forms of communications with the
                                        public, the principal should be aware of the nuances.

                                        Exaggerated or misleading statements are prohibited. In determining whether a
                                        communication is misleading, FINRA calls for consideration of the following:
                                         Overall context of the statement—a statement that is misleading in one context may be
                                          appropriate in another. An essential test in this regard is the balanced treatment of risks
                                          and potential returns.
                                         Different levels of explanation or detail may be needed, depending on the audience
                                          and the ability of the member to control who might come in contact with the
                                          communication.
                                         Overall clarity of the communication—FINRA warns that unclear statements can create
                                          serious misunderstandings to the point of constituting a rules violation.

                                                    EXAMPLE
                                                    Overly technical explanations or material disclosures buried in footnotes are likely to
                                                    confuse the reader and could be construed as misleading.


                                        Use of Investment Company Rankings in Retail Communications
                                        For purposes of this rule, the term ranking entity refers to any entity that provides general
                                        information about investment companies to the public, that is independent of the investment
                                        company and its affiliates, and whose services are not procured by the investment company or
                                        any of its affiliates to assign the investment company a ranking.

                                        Members may not use investment company rankings in any retail communication other than
                                         rankings created and published by Ranking Entities or
                                         rankings created by an investment company or an investment company affiliate but based
                                          on standard performance measurements.

                       Required Disclosures of Investment Company Rankings
                       A headline or other prominent statement must not state or imply that an investment company
                       or investment company family is the best performer in a category unless it is ranked first in
                       the category.

                       Other disclosures include
                        the name of the category (e.g., growth);
                        the name of the ranking entity and, if applicable, the fact that the investment company or
                         an affiliate created the category or subcategory;
                        criteria on which the ranking is based (e.g., total return, risk-adjusted performance);
                        the fact that past performance is no guarantee of future results; and
                        a ranking based on total return must be accompanied by rankings based on total return
                         for one year, five years, and 10 years, or since inception, if shorter.


                       Requirements for the Use of Bond Mutual Fund Volatility Ratings
                       The term bond mutual fund volatility rating is a description issued by an independent
                       third party. The rating relates to the sensitivity of the net asset value (NAV) of a portfolio of
                       an open-end management investment company that invests in debt securities to changes in
                       market conditions and the general economy. The rating is based on an evaluation of objective
                       factors, including
                        the credit quality of the fund’s individual portfolio holdings;
                        the market price volatility of the portfolio;
                        the fund’s performance, and specific risks, such as
                         – interest rate risk,
                           –   prepayment risk, and
                           –   currency risk.

                       These ratings may not describe volatility as a risk rating.


                       Required Disclosures of Bond Mutual Fund Volatility Ratings
                       The name of the entity that issued the rating must be disclosed, along with                                  Unit 19
                        the date of the current rating;
                        a link to a website that includes the criteria and methodology used;
                        a statement that there is no standard method to determine the rating;
                        a description of the types of risk the rating measures (e.g., short-term volatility); and
                        a statement that there is no guarantee the fund will continue to have the same rating or
                         perform in the future as rated.


                       CMO Suitability
                       CMOs are multi-class debt instruments backed by a pool of mortgages, such as Ginnie Maes.
                       They are far more complex than stocks and bonds. Even the registered representative may have
                       a difficult time understanding how these work.

                                       FINRA Rule 2216 states that before a member can sell a CMO to a retail customer (anyone
                                       other than an institutional investor), the firm must be sure the representative is trained and
                                       must offer the customer educational material that includes information and a discussion on
                                        the characteristics and risks of CMOs, including prepayment rates and average lives;
                                        the interest rates, including their effect on value and prepayment rates;
                                        tax considerations;
                                        transaction costs and liquidity;
                                        the structure of CMOs, including the different tranches that are offered and the risks
                                         pertain­ing to each;
                                        the relationship between mortgage loans and mortgage securities;

                                        a glossary of terms.
                                       Any retail communication concerning CMOs
                                        may not compare CMOs to any other investment vehicle, including bank CDs;
                                        must disclose, if applicable, that a government agency backing applies only to the face
                                         value of the CMO and not to any premium paid; and
                                        must disclose that a CMO’s yield and average life will fluctuate depending on the prepay­
                                         ment rate and changes in interest rates.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   6.   A member firm is selling CMOs. Which of the following statements regarding member
                                                        advertising for this security are true?
                                                         A. The member may state that the CMO is guaranteed by the federal government.
                                                         B. The member may state that the CMO is similar to a mortgage REIT.
                                                         C. The member may compare the CMO to a bank CD.
                                                         D. The member must state that the CMO’s yield and average life will fluctuate
                                                             depending on the prepayment rate.
                                                        Answer: D. A communication with the public may never compare a CMO to any
                                                        other investment vehicle. Furthermore, retail communication must state that yield
                                                        and average life will fluctuate depending on the prepayment rate and changes in
                                                        interest rates.


                                       Options Communications
                                       The three categories we’ve been discussing in this unit also apply to communications about
                                       options. A registered options principal (ROP) is responsible for advance approval of retail
                                       communications.

                                       With regard to retail communication relating to options, the mem­ber must file copies with
                                       FINRA at least 10 calendar days before first use (prefiling) if the OCC Disclosure Booklet
                                       (ODD) has not been delivered. Firms have two methods of filing with FINRA’s Advertising
                                       Regulation Department: (1) electronically using a web-based filing system, or (2) in hard
                                       copy.

                                       Options advertising is limited to

                            whom a current OCC Disclosure Booklet may be obtained.

                          Options communications used prior to the delivery of the options disclosure document must
                          not contain recommendations or past or projected performance figures, including annualized
                          rates of return or names of specific securities. As long as the communication contains contact
                          information for obtaining a copy of the options disclosure document, it must be limited to
                          general descriptions of the options being discussed (e.g., equity, index, or foreign currency).
                          The communication may also contain a brief description of options, including a discussion of
                          how an option is priced.

                                     PRACTICE QUESTION
                                     7.   Retail communications describing bull put spreads must be approved by
                                           A. a branch manager.
                                           B. an advertising principal.
                                           C. the chief compliance officer.
                                           D. a registered options principal (ROP).
                                          Answer: D. When it comes to approval of communications dealing with options,
                                          approvals can only be done by a ROP.

                                        Exclusions From the Filing Requirement
                                        Here are some of the most likely exclusions to be tested:

                                        annuities, in addition to the general FINRA standards governing communications. These
                                        standards are applicable to advertisements and sales literature, as well as individualized
                                        communications such as personalized letters and computer-generated illustrations, whether
                                        printed or made available on-screen.

                                        All communications must clearly describe the product as either variable life or a variable
                                        annuity, as applicable. Proprietary names may be used in addition to these descriptions. There
                                        may be no implication that the product being offered or its underlying account is a mutual
                                        fund.

                       Liquidity
                       Because variable life insurance and variable annuities frequently involve substantial charges
                       and/or tax penalties for early withdrawal, there may be no representation or implication that
                       these are short-term, liquid investments. Any statement about the ease of liquidation of these
                       products must be accompanied by the negative impact of factors such as contingent deferred
                       sales loads, tax penalties, and impact on cash value and death benefits.


                       Guarantees
                       Although insurance products contain a number of specific guarantees, the relative safety of the
                       product from these guarantees may not be overemphasized because it depends on the claims-
                       paying ability of the insurance company. There may be no representation or implication that a
                       guarantee applies to the investment return or principal value of the separate account. Also, it
                       may not be represented or implied that an insurance company’s financial ratings apply to the
                       separate account.

                       Although the rating firms S&P and Moody’s Investor Service offer ratings on the financial
                       health of insurance companies, the primary source used by almost everyone in the industry
                       is A.M. Best. An A or A+ rating from them signifies substantial ability to meet their claim
                       obligations.


                       Fund Performance Predating Inclusion in a Variable Product
                       Illustrations are sometimes used to show how an existing fund would have performed as an
                       investment option within a variable life or variable annuity policy. Performance that predates
                       a fund’s inclusion may be used only if no significant changes occurred to the fund at the time
                       or after it became a part of the variable product.


                       Single Premium Variable Life
                       Communications regarding single premium variable life may only emphasize investment
                       features of this product if an adequate explanation of the life insurance features is also
                       provided.

                       When a life insurance policy is funded with too much money within a seven-year period, it is
                                                                                                                                   Unit 19
                       defined as a modified endowment contract (MEC). MECs have restricted access to cash values
                       and also lose some tax advantages that other cash value polices have. Therefore, few single
                       premium life insurance policies are issued.


                       Hypothetical Illustrations of Rates of Return in Variable Life Insurance
                       Hypothetical illustrations showing assumed rates of return may be used to demonstrate the
                       performance of variable life policies. Rules that apply to the use of these illustrations include
                       the following:

                                             rate illustrated should be reasonable, considering market conditions and the available
                                             investment options.
                                         Illustrations must reflect the maximum mortality and expense charges associated with the
                                          policy for each assumed rate of return illustrated. Current charges may also be illustrated.

                                        In general, variable life product performance may not be compared with other investment
                                        products. However, comparison of variable life with a term insurance product is permitted
                                        to demonstrate the concept of tax-deferred growth resulting from investment in the variable
                                        product.

                                                         Answer: B. Even with excellent performance of the separate account, it generally
                                                         takes a number of years before the cash value equals the amount of the premiums
                                                         paid. Furthermore, there are no guarantees to the cash value. It could be more,
                                                         less, or the same as the total of premium payments. Remember that hypothetical
                                                         projections must always include a return of 0% and cannot show more than 12%.

              INTRODUCTION
                         We have learned about the many different types of securities available in the marketplaces.
                         Many issued by corporations, others by governments, federal, state and local. In all cases, the
                         purpose of issuing these securities is to raise money and capital to work for the benefit of the
                         issuer.

                         In general, investors purchase securities as new issues from a corporation, municipality, or
                         the federal government. After the initial sale, those securities trade in the secondary market as
                         trades between investors. This unit begins the process for bringing new issues to market. It then
                         continues with the many legal requirements related to raising capital publicly and privately.

           LESSON 20.1: MARKETING NEW ISSUES
                                        LO 20.a Identify characteristics of the primary market.



                                        The Primary Market
                                        The term primary market does not refer to a market place such as an exchange or the OTC
                                        market. The primary market describes the sale of securities to the investing public in what
                                        are known as issuer transactions. That means the issuer receives the proceeds generated by the
                                        sale of those securities. In all cases, these are shares that have never been issued to the public
                                        before. The most common example is the initial public (or primary) offering (IPO). Those
                                        shares represent the first time any shares have been issued to raise new capital for the issuer.

                                        Can an issuer have more than one primary offering? Yes, it happens with mutual funds every
                                        day. As you learned in Unit 8, open-end investment companies are constantly issuing new
                                        shares. They have a primary every day. However, they, like any other issuer, can only have one
                                        IPO. Whenever a corporation wishes to raise additional equity capital, it can issue additional
                                        new shares. These shares generally come from the authorized but unissued shares we discussed
                                        in Unit 3. There are several terms used for these additional primary offerings, such as follow-on
                                        offering or additional primary offering (APO).

                                        The easiest way to identify a primary offering is to “follow the money.” If the funds wind up
                                        in the coffers of the issuer, it is a primary offering or a primary distribution.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    There is one case where the issuer receives the proceeds and it is not a primary
                                                    offering. When a company resells treasury stock, it receives the proceeds. Because
                                                    those shares were previously owned, it cannot be called a primary offering.

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                    1.   An initial public offering (IPO) is always
                                                          A. an issuer transaction.
                                                          B. a nonissuer transaction.
                                                          C. of treasury stock.
                                                          D. a follow-on offering.
                                                         Answer: A. An issuer transaction is one where the money goes to the issuer. An IPO
                                                         is the first time the issuer is raising funds from the public. A nonissuer transaction is
                                                         when the money goes to investors rather than the issuer. A sale of treasury stock is an
                                                         issuer transaction, but it cannot be an IPO because those shares were already sold. A
                                                         follow-on offering is an offering of new shares, but it “follows” after an IPO.


                                        The Secondary Market
                                        Discussed in detail in Lesson 3.3, once a new issue has been distributed, all further buying
                                        and selling takes place in the secondary market. As pointed out much earlier, these are the
                                        exchanges, Nasdaq, and the OTC market. Transactions in the secondary market are largely
                                        nonissuer transactions. That is, the proceeds of the sale do not go to the issuer; they go to the
                                        selling shareholder (or bondholder).

                       LO 20.b Recall the process for bringing new issues to market.



                       Participants in a New Issue
                       The main participants in a new issue are the entity selling the securities and the broker-dealer
                       acting as the underwriter (investment banker). The exam will focus on both corporate and
                       municipal underwritings. Most of the industry participants play similar roles for both. Where
                       there is an important difference, we will note it.


                       The Issuer
                       Unless the issue is exempt from registration (coming up in the next lesson), the issuer (the
                       entity), selling the securities to raise money, must file a registration statement with the SEC.
                       This document requires that the issuer supply sufficient information about the security and
                       the corporation and its officers to allow an investor to make a sound investment decision.
                       When the SEC reviews this document, during what is known as the 20-day cooling-off
                       period, it looks for sufficiency of investment information rather than accuracy, though upon
                       completion of the review, it does not guarantee adequacy of the prospectus.

                       Near the end of the cooling-off period, the underwriter holds a due diligence meeting.
                       The preliminary studies, investigations, research, meetings, and compilation of information
                       about a corporation and a proposed new issue that go on during an underwriting are known
                       collectively as due diligence.

                       The underwriter must conduct a formal due diligence meeting to provide information
                       about the issue, the issuer’s financial background, and the intended use of the proceeds.
                       Representatives of the issuer and the underwriter attend these meetings and answer questions
                       from broker-dealers, securities analysts, and institutions.

                       When underwriting municipal revenue bonds, this due diligence investigation relies on a
                       feasibility study. This study focuses on the projected revenues and costs associated with the
                       project and an analysis of competing facilities.

                       As part of the due diligence process, investment bankers must
                        examine the use of the proceeds,
                        perform financial analysis and feasibility studies,
                        determine the company’s stability, and
                        determine whether the risk is reasonable.

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 The issuer knows a lot about manufacturing, accounting, software, or whatever it is
                                 they do. They don’t know a lot about what it takes to sell securities to the public. That
                                 is why an investment banking firm is used.

                                                                                                                                     Unit 20

           506         Unit 20   The New Issues Market



                                        Underwriter
                                        A business (or municipal government) that plans to issue securities usually works with an
                                        underwriter, a broker-dealer specializing in investment banking—the process of underwriting
                                        new issues. An investment bank’s functions may include
                                         advising corporations on the best ways to raise long-term capital,
                                         raising capital for issuers by distributing new securities,
                                         buying securities from issuers and reselling them to the public,
                                         distributing large blocks of stock to the public and to institutions, and
                                         helping issuers comply with securities laws.
                                        The investment banker who negotiates with the issuer is known as the underwriting manager
                                        or syndicate manager. The underwriting manager directs the entire underwriting process,
                                        including signing the underwriting agreement with the issuer and directing the due diligence
                                        meeting and distribution process. A syndicate may have more than one manager.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    Investment bankers help issuers raise money through the sale of securities. They
                                                    do not loan money. They are also called underwriters. All underwriters of corporate
                                                    securities must be FINRA member firms. Underwriters of municipal securities must be
                                                    members of the MSRB.


                                        Forming a Syndicate
                                        The MSRB defines the syndicate (sometimes called a selling syndicate) as “a group of
                                        underwriters formed to purchase (underwrite) a new issue of municipal securities from the
                                        issuer and offer it for resale to the general public. The syndicate is organized for the purposes
                                        of sharing the risks of underwriting the issue, obtaining sufficient capital to purchase an issue
                                        and broadening the distribution channels of the issue to the investing public.”

                                        Underwriting syndicate members make a financial commitment to help bring the securities
                                        public. In a firm commitment offering, all syndicate members commit to purchase from the
                                        issuer and then distribute an agreed-on amount of the issue (their participation or bracket).
                                        Syndicate members sign a syndicate agreement, or syndicate letter, that describes the
                                        participants’ responsibilities and allocation of syndicate profits, if any. Syndicate and selling
                                        groups may be assembled either before or after the issue is awarded to the underwriter.
                                        In a negotiated underwriting, the issuer and the investment banker negotiate the offering
                                        terms, including the amount of securities to be offered, offering price or yield, and
                                        underwriting fees.

                                        Negotiated underwritings are standard in underwriting corporate securities because of close
                                        business relationships between issuing corporations and investment banking firms.

                                        Competitive bid underwriting arrangements are the standard for underwriting most general
                                        obligation (GO) municipal securities and are often required by state law. In a competitive bid,
                                        a state or municipal government invites investment bankers to bid for a new issue of bonds.
                                        The issuer awards the securities to the underwriter(s) whose bid results in the lowest net
                                        interest cost to the issuer.

                                                                                       Unit 20   The New Issues Market     507


                       After the issuing municipality meets with the municipality’s attorneys and accountants to
                       analyze each bid, it awards the municipal bond issue to the syndicate that offers to underwrite
                       the bonds at the lowest net interest cost or true interest cost to the issuer.

                       Net interest cost (NIC) is a common calculation used for comparing bids and awarding the
                       bond issue. It combines the amount of proceeds the issuer receives with the total coupon
                       interest it pays. True interest cost (TIC) provides the same type of cost comparison adjusted
                       for the time value of money.

                                  TAKE NOTE
                                  NIC is a straight mathematical interest-rate calculation. The lowest NIC is the winner.
                                  TIC weights early interest payments more heavily to give greater value to dollars of
                                  today over dollars to be paid in the future, consistent with present value calculations.


                       Selling Group Formation
                       Although the members of an underwriting syndicate agree to underwrite an entire offering,
                       they frequently enlist other firms to help distribute the securities as members of the selling
                       group. Selling group members act as agents with no commitment to buy securities.

                       The managing underwriter is normally responsible for determining whether to use a selling
                       group and, if so, which firms to include. If the securities to be issued are attractive, broker-
                       dealers will want to participate. If the securities are not attractive, the manager may have to
                       persuade broker-dealers to join.

                       Selling group members sign a selling group agreement with the underwriters, which typically
                       contains
                        a statement that the manager acts for all of the underwriters,
                        the amount of securities each selling group member will be allotted and the tentative
                         public offering price (POP) at which the securities will be sold (this price is firmed up just
                         before the offering date),
                        the portion of the underwriting spread (called the concession) to be received on sales
                         made by selling group members (this is usually the largest portion of the spread);
                        provisions as to how and when payment for shares is to be made to the managing
                         underwriter, and
                        legal provisions limiting each selling group member’s liability in conjunction with the
                         underwriting.

                                  TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                  Syndicate members take on financial liability and act in a principal capacity. Selling
                                  group members have no financial liability and act as agents because they have no
                                  commitment to buy securities from the issuer.

                                                         Answer: C. The term used to describe the investment banker who leads the
                                                         negotiations is the syndicate or underwriting manager. It is possible the term lead
                                                         underwriter could be used as well.


                                        Types of Underwriting Agreements
                                        An agreement among underwriters details each underwriter’s commitment and liability,
                                        particularly for any shares that remain unsold at the underwriting syndicate’s termination.

                                        The agreement designates the syndicate manager to act on behalf of the syndicate members.
                                        The manager’s authority to manage the underwriting, which includes establishing the offering
                                        price with the issuer, deciding the timing of the offering, controlling advertising, and making
                                        all required filings, comes via this agreement.


                                        Firm Commitment
                                        The firm commitment is the most commonly used type of underwriting contract. Under its
                                        terms, the underwriter(s) [investment bank(s)] commit to buy the securities from the issuer
                                        and resell them to the public. The underwriters assume the financial risk of incurring losses in
                                        the event they are unable to distribute all the shares to the public.

                                        A firm commitment underwriting can be either a negotiated underwriting contract or a
                                        competitive bid arrangement. Negotiated underwriting contracts are used in most corporate
                                        issues. The issuer selects an underwriter and negotiates the conditions of the underwriting
                                        contract. A competitive bid arrangement is the standard for new issue offering in the
                                        municipal securities market. Sales begin on the effective date of the offering.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    In a firm commitment underwriting, the managing underwriter takes on the financial
                                                    risk because he purchases the securities from the issuer. Because he purchases and
                                                    resells the shares, he is acting in a principal (dealer) capacity.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    Syndicates are usually formed to spread the risk of an offering among several
                                                    underwriters instead of one underwriter taking all the risk.

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                    3.   Because the firm commitment is the most commonly used type of underwriting
                                                         contract, which of the following can be said of this type of underwriting?
                                                          A. A firm commitment underwriting must be used with a negotiated underwriting
                                                              contract.
                                                          B. A firm commitment underwriting can be either a negotiated underwriting
                                                              contract or a competitive bid arrangement.
                                                          C. In a firm commitment all the underwriting risk is shifted to the issuer.
                                                          D. A firm commitment may be added to a best efforts for the sake of securing the
                                                              underwriting commitment.
                                                         Answer: B. A firm commitment can be used with either type of underwriting. The
                                                         risk is shifted from the issuer to the underwriter(s).

                       Standby
                       Standby is a form of firm commitment unique to corporate rights offerings. When a
                       company’s current stockholders do not exercise their preemptive rights in an additional
                       offering, a corporation has an underwriter standing by to purchase whatever shares remain
                       unsold as a result of rights expiring.

                       Because the standby underwriter unconditionally agrees to buy all shares that current
                       stockholders do not subscribe to at the subscription price, the offering is a firm commitment.

                                  TAKE NOTE
                                  By engaging a standby underwriter, an issuer is assured of selling all the shares being
                                  offered, even if the shareholders do not exercise their rights.


                       Best Efforts
                       In a best efforts arrangement, the underwriter acts as an agent for the issuing corporation.
                       The deal is contingent on the underwriter’s ability to sell shares to the public. In a best efforts
                       underwriting, the underwriter sells as much as possible, without financial liability for what
                       remains unsold. The underwriter is acting in an agency capacity with no financial risk.


                       All-or-None
                       In an all-or-none (AON) underwriting, the issuing corporation has determined that it wants
                       an agreement outlining that the underwriter must either sell all of the shares or cancel the
                       underwriting. Because of the uncertainty over the outcome of an AON offering, any funds
                       collected from investors during the offering period must be held in escrow pending final
                       disposition of the underwriting.

                       Broker-dealers engaged in an AON distribution are prohibited from deceiving investors by
                       stating that all the securities in the underwriting have been sold if it is not the case.


                       Mini-Max
                       A mini-max offering is a best efforts underwriting setting a floor or minimum, which is the
                       least amount the issuer needs to raise to move forward with the underwriting, and a ceiling or
                       maximum on the dollar amount of securities the issuer is willing to sell. The underwriter must
                       locate enough interested buyers to support the minimum (floor) issuance requirement. Once
                       the minimum is met, the underwriter can expand the offering up to the maximum (ceiling)
                       amount of shares the issuer specified. Mini-max underwriting terms are most frequently
                       found in limited partnership program offerings, and funds collected from investors during the
                       offering period must be held in escrow pending final disposition of the underwriting.

                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                  4.   An underwriting syndicate has a firm commitment with an issuer to sell $5 million
                                       of common stock to the public. The syndicate has four selling groups. What is each

                                       selling group’s financial responsibility for the sale?
                                        A. Each shares a firm commitment with the issuer to sell all the securities in the
                                             offering.
                                        B. Each selling group is responsible for $1 million of the $5 million offering.
                                        C. Selling groups take no financial responsibility in the offering.
                                        D. Each member of the selling group is responsible for its proportionate share of
                                             the offering.

                                                        Answer: C. The primary difference between the selling syndicate and the selling
                                                        group is the financial commitment. Selling group members only get paid for what
                                                        they sell. Selling groups are not limited to selling to institutional buyers.

                                                   Be prepared for a question that requires an understanding of underwriter risk in firm

                                       Underwriting Municipal Securities
                                       There are a number of testable procedures and terms relating to municipal securities.
                                       Although similar in concept to corporate securities, the exam will relate these to municipal
                                       securities. One significant difference between corporate and municipal underwritings to note
                                       is the need for a legal opinion, covered in Lesson 6.


                                       Formation of the Municipal Underwriting Syndicate
                                       As we know, a syndicate is an account that helps spread the risk of underwriting an issue
                                       among a number of underwriters. Although the bidding process for most municipal bonds is
                                       competitive, successive offerings of a particular municipality are often handled on a negotiated
                                       basis by the same syndicate, which is composed of the same members.

                                       A firm makes the decision to participate as a syndicate member after it considers
                                        the potential demand for the security,
                                        the existence of presale orders,
                                        the determination and extent of liability,
                                        the scale and spread, and
                                        the ability to sell the issue.
                                       Participants formalize their relationship by signing a syndicate letter, or syndicate
                                       agreement, in a competitive bid or a syndicate contract, or agreement among underwriters,
                                       in a negotiated underwriting. About two weeks before the issue is awarded, the syndicate
                                       manager sends the syndicate letter or contract to each participating firm for an authorized
                                       signature. The member’s signature indicates that the member agrees with the offering terms.
                                       Syndicate letters include
                                        each member firm’s level of participation or commitment;
                                        priority of order allocation;
                                        duration of the syndicate account;
                                        appointment of the manager(s) as agent(s) for the account;
                                        fee for the managing underwriter and breakdown of the spread; and
                                        other obligations, such as member expenses, good-faith deposits, observance of offering
                                         terms, and liability for unsold bonds.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   Syndicate letters are not legally binding until the syndicate’s submission of the bid.
                                                   Firms may drop from the group until this point.

                       Types of Syndicate Accounts
                       The financial liability to which each underwriter is exposed depends on the type of syndicate
                       account. Underwriting syndicates use two arrangements: Western accounts and Eastern
                       accounts.


                       Western Account
                       A Western account is a divided account. Each underwriter is responsible only for its own
                       underwriting allocation.


                       Eastern Account
                       An Eastern account is an undivided account. Each underwriter is allocated a portion of
                       the issue. After the issue has been substantially distributed, each underwriter is allocated
                       additional bonds representing its proportionate share of any unsold bonds. Thus, an
                       underwriter’s financial liability might not end when it has distributed its initial allocation.

                                  TAKE NOTE
                                  When remembering the difference between Western and Eastern, divided and
                                  undivided accounts, try this phrase: “The continental divide is in the West.” It helps
                                  remind you that Western accounts and divided accounts are the same, as are Eastern
                                  and undivided accounts.

                                  EXAMPLE
                                  A syndicate is underwriting a $5 million municipal bond issue. There are five syndicate
                                  members, each with equal participation, including your firm. Your firm sells its
                                  entire allocation, but bonds worth $1 million remain unsold by the other syndicate
                                  members.
                                  If this is a Western account, what is your firm’s liability?
                                  In a Western account, your firm would have no remaining liability because its
                                  entire share was sold. However, if your firm had sold only $700,000 of its $1 million
                                  allocation, it would have to purchase the remaining $300,000 for its own inventory.
                                  If this is an Eastern account, what is your firm’s liability?
                                  In an Eastern account, the unsold amount is divided among all syndicate members
                                  based on their initial participation. In this example, your firm would be allocated
                                  20% of the remaining amount, or $200,000. The responsibility for any unsold bonds
                                  continues until the entire bond issue is sold.

                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                  5.   An investment banker is a member of the selling syndicate of a new issue of
                                       municipal bonds. The member commits to $500,000 of bonds out of a total offering
                                       of $5 million in an undivided syndicate and sells $300,000 of the bonds. Of the
                                       total offering, $1 million of the bonds are unsold. What is the syndicate member’s

                                                         Answer: A. An Eastern or undivided syndicate means joint and several liability
                                                         for any unsold portion. This firm’s original commitment was for 10% of the issue.
                                                         Therefore, the liability is for 10% of the unsold portion. With $1 million unsold, 10% is
                                                         $100,000.


                                        The Syndicate Bid
                                        A syndicate will present a bid to the issuer to win the right to represent the new issue in the
                                        primary market. If a syndicate wins the bid they will be selling the bonds to the public in the
                                        IPO.


                                        Establishing the Bid
                                        The syndicate arrives at its competitive bid over a series of meetings during which member
                                        dealers discuss the proposed reoffering scale and spread for the underwriters. Their goal is to
                                        arrive at the best price to the issuer while still making a profit. At a preliminary meeting, the
                                        manager seeks a tentative agreement from members on the prices or yields of all maturities in
                                        the issue as well as the gross profit or underwriting spread (the difference between what the
                                        public pays and what the issuer receives).

                                        A final bid price for the bond is set at a meeting conducted just before the bid is due. If the
                                        member dealers cannot all agree on a final bid, the syndicate can go ahead with its bid as long
                                        as the syndicate members agree to abide by the majority’s decision.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    To win the bid, the syndicate must resolve this question: What is the lowest interest
                                                    rate that can win the bid and provide a competitive investment to public buyers as
                                                    well as provide a profit for the underwriter?
                                        The process of establishing the reoffering yield (or price) for each maturity is called writing
                                        the scale. A scale is the list of the bond issue’s different maturities. If the coupon rate has
                                        already been determined, each maturity listed is assigned a yield. If the rate has not been set,
                                        each maturity is assigned a coupon. A normal scale has higher yields for long-term bonds.

                                        Once the underwriters have written a scale that allows them to resell the bonds, they prepare
                                        the final bid. Put another way, writing the scale involves first determining what prices (yields)
                                        are necessary to be able to sell the various serial maturities and then backing off a little to
                                        arrive at a bid. Before they submit the bid, the underwriters must ensure that they have met
                                        any unique specifications the issuer has set.
                                        Competitive bids are submitted as firm commitments. This means that the underwriters are
                                        committing to sell all the bonds. If any are left unsold, the underwriters must take them for
                                        their own accounts. Therefore, bids must be carefully written to be competitive yet profitable.
                                        Underwriters receive no profit guarantee. Note that syndicates bidding on the proposed issue
                                        must bid on the entire amount being offered for sale.


                                        Disclosure of Fees
                                        Fees to be paid to a clearing agency and the syndicate manager must be disclosed to syndicate
                                        members in advance. Normally, this disclosure is part of the syndicate letter or the agreement
                                        among underwriters. Management fees include any amount in the gross spread that is paid to
                                        the manager alone and not shared with syndicate members.

                       Awarding the Issue
                       After the issuing municipality meets with the municipality’s attorneys and accountants to
                       analyze each bid, it awards the municipal bond issue to the syndicate that offers to underwrite
                       the bonds at the lowest NIC or true interest cost to the issuer.

                       When the issuer makes its choice, it announces the successful bidder and returns the good-
                       faith deposits to the remaining syndicates.

                       The successful syndicate has a firm commitment to purchase the bonds from the issuer and
                       reoffer them to the public at the agreed on offering price. The issuer keeps the successful
                       bidder’s good-faith deposit to ensure that the syndicate carries out its commitment.

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 While the amount of the good-faith deposit can differ from one issue to another, it is
                                 usually 1%–2% of the total par value of the offering.


                       Syndicate Account
                       The syndicate account is created when the issue is awarded. The syndicate manager is
                       responsible for keeping the books and managing the account. All sale proceeds are deposited
                       to the syndicate account, and all expenses are paid out of the account. Settlement of syndicate
                       accounts is 30 calendar days after the issuer delivers the securities to the syndicate. Therefore,
                       the maximum length of time for the syndicate to exist is 30 calendar days from the time the
                       issuer delivers the securities to the syndicate.


                       Breakdown of the Spread
                       The price at which the bonds are sold to the public is known as the reoffering price (or
                       reoffering yield). The syndicate’s compensation for underwriting the new issue is the spread,
                       or the difference between the price the syndicate pays the issuer and the reoffering price. Each
                       participant in the syndicate is entitled to a portion of the spread, depending on the role each
                       member plays in the underwriting.

                                 EXAMPLE
                                 A corporation issues stock to the public at $20 per share. It is done through a firm
                                 commitment and the syndicate manager’s fee is $0.25 per share. The underwriting fee
                                 is $0.40 per share and the selling concession is $0.50 per share. The issuer will receive
                                 A. $19.75 per share.
                                 B. $19.60 per share.
                                 C. $19.10 per share.
                                 D. $18.85 per share.

                                 Answer: D. The proceeds to the issuer are the offering price less the spread. The
                                 spread consists of all of these pieces ($0.25 + $0.40 + $0.50) and is a total of $1.15. The
                                 $20 offering price less the $1.15 spread results in the issuer receiving $18.85 per share.
                                                                                                                                      Unit 20
                                 TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                 Just as with mutual funds, the offering price, or public offering price, is the price paid
                                 by investors and includes the spread. That is, using the above example, the investors
                                 do not pay the $20 per share plus something else. Everything is included.

           514         Unit 20   The New Issues Market



                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    The term production refers to the total dollar sales earned from a municipal issue. The
                                                    production less the amount bid for the issue results in the spread.


                                        Syndicate Management Fee
                                        Syndicate managers receive a per-bond fee for their work in bringing the new issue to market.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    The manager might receive 1/8 point ($1.25) as a management fee from a total spread
                                                    of 1 point ($10).


                                        Total Takedown
                                        The portion of the spread that remains after subtracting the management fee is called the total
                                        takedown. Members buy the bonds from the syndicate manager at the takedown.

                                        In the following example, for a 1-point spread with a management fee of 1/8 point, the
                                        takedown is 7/8 point ($8.75). A syndicate member that has purchased bonds at the takedown
                                        can sell its bonds either to customers at the offering price or to a dealer in the selling group
                                        below the offering price.

                                        Unlike syndicate members, firms that are part of the selling group do not assume financial
                                        risk. They are engaged to help the syndicate members sell the new issue. Their compensation
                                        for each bond sold is termed the selling concession.


                                        Selling Concession and Additional Takedown
                                        A syndicate member can buy bonds from the manager for $991.25, sell them to the public for
                                        $1,000, and earn the takedown of 7/8 point ($8.75). If the firm chooses instead to sell bonds to
                                        a member of the selling group, it does so at a price less than $1,000, or, $995 in the following
                                        example. The discount the selling group receives from the syndicate member is called the
                                        selling concession. This $5 is equal to 1/2 point.

                                        Selling group members buy bonds from syndicate members at the concession. The syndicate
                                        member keeps the remainder of the total takedown, called the additional takedown. The
                                        additional takedown in this example is 3/8 point ($3.75).

                                      The syndicate manager may notify other firms that are not syndicate or selling group members
                                      of the new issue through The Bond Buyer. Interested firms may buy the bonds from the
                                      syndicate at a small discount from the reoffer price. This discount is termed a reallowance,
                                      which is generally half of the concession amount.

                                                TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                Municipal spread questions are generally asked in terms of points, not dollars. One
                                                bond point equals $10.
                                                Be ready for a question that asks you to rank parts of the spread in order of their size.
                                                Remember that the manager’s fee is typically the smallest, and the total takedown
                                                is the largest. The additional takedown is a part of the total takedown amount, even
                                                though the name is a bit misleading.
                                                You may see a question that asks under what circumstances a syndicate member can
                                                receive the full spread when a bond is sold. The answer is that the syndicate member
                                                receives the full spread if the member is also the syndicate manager. Also, be ready to
                                                define total takedown as the concession plus the additional takedown.

                                                     a new issue except
                                                       A. the prevailing interest rates in the marketplace.

           516         Unit 20   The New Issues Market



                                                         Answer: D. The spread is the difference between the reoffering price and the amount
                                                         bid on an issue in competitive bidding. MSRB rules state that a dealer is entitled to
                                                         make a profit in an underwriting. Therefore, the dealer can take into account such
                                                         factors as market conditions, the type and size of the issue, the dollar volume of the
                                                         transaction, and any extraordinary costs incurred by the syndicate. The amount of
                                                         the good-faith check deposited before bidding on the issue has no relevance to the
                                                         bid or to the reoffering price.


                                        Order Allocation
                                        Municipal bond orders are allocated according to priorities the syndicate sets in advance.
                                        The MSRB requires syndicates to establish priority allocation provisions for orders. The
                                        managing underwriter must submit these provisions to all syndicate members in writing.
                                        Normally, the manager includes allocation priorities and confirmation procedures in the
                                        syndicate agreement.

                                        The syndicate must establish a definite sequence in which orders will be accepted and cannot
                                        simply state that the order priority will be left to the manager’s discretion.

                                        Syndicate members must signify in writing their acceptance of the allocation priorities. In
                                        addition, the manager must notify the members in writing of any change to the set priorities.


                                        Order Period
                                        The MSRB has established a timeline for municipal underwritings. The order period is the
                                        time set by the manager during which the syndicate solicits customers for the issue and all
                                        orders are allocated without regard to the sequence in which they were received. The order
                                        period usually runs for an hour on the day following the award of the bid.


                                        Allocation Priorities
                                        A syndicate’s allocation priorities become especially important when a bond issue is
                                        oversubscribed. The normal priority follows.


                                        Presale Order
                                        A presale order is entered before the date that the syndicate wins the bid, which means that a
                                        customer is willing to place an order without knowing the final price or whether the syndicate
                                        will even win the bid. A presale order takes priority over other types of orders, and individual
                                        syndicate members are not credited with any takedown on presale orders. The takedown is
                                        split among all syndicate members according to participation.


                                        Group Net Order
                                        A group order is placed after the bid is awarded. A syndicate member that wants a customer’s
                                        order to receive priority enters the order as a group net order. The takedown on a group net
                                        order is deposited in the syndicate account, and upon completion of the underwriting, it is
                                        split among all syndicate members according to participation.

                                                                                          Unit 20   The New Issues Market     517


                         Designated Order
                         The next highest priority for orders received during the order period is assigned to designated
                         orders. These orders are usually from institutions that wish to allocate the takedown to certain
                         syndicate members.


                         Member Order and Member-Related Order
                         The lowest priority for orders goes to member and member-related orders. A member firm
                         enters such an order for its own inventory or related accounts, such as for a dealer-sponsored
                         unit investment trust (UIT). The easiest way to remember the priority of the various types of
                         orders is that the highest priority is given to those orders that benefit the most members. The
                         lowest priority is given to orders that benefit a single member.

                         Under MSRB rules, a syndicate member placing an order for a related account must disclose
                         this fact to the syndicate manager when the order is placed. Therefore, the manager will know
                         to accord these orders the lowest priority.

                         Within two business days of the sale date, the syndicate manager must send a written
                         summary of how orders were allocated to the other syndicate members.

                                   TAKE NOTE
                                   A simple way to remember the normal order allocation priority found in the syndicate
                                   letter is Pro Golfers Don’t Miss. PGDM stands for Presale, Group, Designated, and

                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                   7.   An order confirmed for the benefit of the entire underwriting syndicate placed after
                                        the bid is awarded is called
                                          A. a group net order.
                                         B. a net designated order.
                                         C. a presale order.
                                         D. a member at the takedown order.
                                        Answer: A. A municipal group net order is credited to syndicate members according
                                        to their percentage participation in the account. This order type is given priority over
                                        designated or member takedown orders, but not over presale orders. By placing this
                                        type of order, syndicate members are stipulating that they want those bond orders
                                        to have the highest priority still available. Note that presale orders are also confirmed
                                        for the benefit of the entire syndicate, but these are placed before the time the
                                        winning bid is awarded.

                         Investigation of the conditions that led to the stock market crash of 1929 determined that
                         investors had little protection from fraud in the sale of new issues of securities. Rumors,
                         exaggerations, and unsubstantiated claims led to excessive speculation in newly issued

                                        stock. Congress passed the Securities Act of 1933 to require issuers of new securities to
                                        file registration statements with the SEC to provide investors with complete and accurate
                                        information in the form of a prospectus when soliciting sales. Think of the Securities Act of
                                        1933 as the Paper Act because of the registration statement and prospectus. It will remind you
                                        of the paperwork requirements for full and fair disclosure.

                                        New securities that are subject to the act’s requirements are called nonexempt issues. Exempt
                                        securities are not subject to these requirements.


                                        Exempt Issuers and Securities
                                        The Securities Act of 1933 provides specific exemptions from federal registration provisions.

                                        Among the exemptions are the following issuers:
                                         The U.S. government
                                         U.S. municipalities and territories
                                         Nonprofit religious, educational, and charitable organizations
                                         Banks and savings and loans
                                         Public utilities and common carriers whose activities are regulated as to rates and other
                                          items by a state or federal regulatory body (e.g., railroad equipment trust certificate)

                                        The following securities are exempt from the Securities Act of 1933:
                                         Commercial paper—maturity less than 270 days
                                         Bankers’ acceptances—maturity less than 270 days
                                         Securities acquired in private placements—Regulation D
                                        When a security is exempt from federal registration, there is no registration statement, no
                                        prospectus. In some cases, a security might have to register solely with the state (e.g. Rule 147
                                        at LO 20.e) or with the state as well as the SEC.


                                        State Registration
                                        State securities laws, also called blue-sky laws, also require registration of securities, broker-
                                        dealers, and registered representatives. An issuer or investment banker may blue-sky an issue
                                        by one of the following methods.
                                         Qualification—The issuer registers only with the state. There is no federal registration
                                          because the issue is sold strictly intrastate. The requirements are those of the specific state.
                                         Coordination—The issuer registers simultaneously with the state and the SEC. Both
                                          registrations become effective on the same date.
                                         Notice filing—Securities listed on the major stock exchanges and on Nasdaq, as well as
                                          investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, are known
                                          as federal covered securities. State registration is not required, but most states require the
                                          filing of a notice that the issuer intends to offer its securities for sale in that state and the
                                          state may assess a filing fee.


                                        The Registration Process
                                        Although we tend to think of new issues when discussing registration, that is not the only
                                        time registration is required. There could be a registered secondary distribution. This is a

                                          founders or principal owners of a corporation). The sale proceeds go to the sellers of the stock,
                                          not to the issuer. There could also be a combined or split offering. This is a public offering
                                          of securities combining both a primary and a secondary offering. A portion of the issue is a
                                          primary offering, the proceeds of which go to the issuing corporation. The remainder of the
                                          issue is a secondary offering, the proceeds of which go to the selling stockholders.

                                          After an issuer files a registration statement with the SEC, a 20-day cooling-off period
                                          begins. During the cooling-off period, the SEC reviews the security’s registration statement
                                          and can issue a stop order if the statement does not contain all of the required information.

                                          The red herring (preliminary prospectus) is used to gauge investor reactions and gather
                                          indications of interest for corporate securities. A registered representative may discuss the issue
                                          with prospects during the cooling-off period and provide them with preliminary information
                                          through the red herring. It must carry a legend, printed in red, that declares that a registration
                                          statement has been filed with the SEC but is not yet effective. The final offering price and
                                          underwriting spread are not included in the red herring.

                                          SEC rules prohibit the sale of public offering securities without a prospectus, which means
                                          that no sales are allowed until the final prospectus is available.

                                          typically published after the offering has been cleared for sale, offer information to investors.

                                        However, they do not offer the securities for sale. Issuers are not required to publish
                                        tombstones, but they may appear either before or after the effective date of the sale.

                                                    The term tombstone advertisement is derived from the bare-bones, minimum

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                    8.   All of the following statements about a red herring are true except
                                                          A. a red herring is used to obtain indications of interest from investors.
                                                          B. the final offering price does not appear in a red herring.
                                                          C. additional information may be added to a red herring at a later date.
                                                          D. registered representatives may send a copy of the company’s research report
                                                                with it.
                                                         Answer: D. Because the preliminary prospectus may be used for gathering
                                                         indications of interest only, it may not be used to solicit sales. No other form of
                                                         communication may be attached to or accompany it.


                                        Pricing the New Issue of Publicly Traded Securities
                                        During the cooling-off period, the underwriter advises the issuing corporation on the best
                                        price at which to offer securities to the public. The following variables may be considered
                                        when pricing new issues:
                                         Indications of interest from the underwriter’s book
                                         Prevailing market conditions, including recent offerings and the prices of similar new
                                          issues
                                         Price that the syndicate members will accept
                                         Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of similar companies and the company’s most recent
                                          earnings report (at what price the shares must be offered so that the P/E ratio is in line
                                          with the P/E ratios of other similar publicly traded stocks)
                                         The company’s dividend payment record (if any) and financial health
                                         The company’s debt ratio
                                        An issue’s price or yield must be determined by the effective date of the registration. The
                                        effective date is when the security begins to trade.

                       FINRA on Size of the Spread
                       FINRA reviews underwritings to determine if the compensation earned by the underwriter(s)
                       is fair and reasonable. There are a number of factors considered. The amount of the spread
                       varies by issue and can be influenced by any of the following:
                        Type of commitment—A firm commitment earns a larger spread than a best efforts
                         agreement because of the risks the underwriter assumes.
                        Security’s marketability—A bond rated AAA has a smaller spread than a speculative stock.
                        Issuer’s business—A stable utility stock usually has a smaller spread than a more volatile
                         stock.
                        Offering size—In a very large offering, the underwriter can spread costs over a larger
                         number of shares; thus, the per share cost may be lower.


                       The Final Prospectus (Effective, Statutory Prospectus)
                       When the registration statement for corporate securities becomes effective, the issuer amends
                       the preliminary prospectus and adds information, including the final offering price and the
                       underwriting spread for the final prospectus. Registered representatives may then take orders
                       from those customers who indicated interest in buying during the cooling-off period.

                       A copy of the final prospectus must precede or accompany all purchase confirmations.
                       However, if the prospectus has been filed with the SEC and is available through its website,
                       access to the prospectus equals delivery of the prospectus.

                       The prospectus must include
                        a description of the offering;
                        the offering price;
                        selling discounts;
                        the offering date;
                        use of the proceeds;
                        a description of the underwriting, but not the actual contract;
                        a statement of the possibility that the issue’s price may be stabilized;
                        a history of the business;
                        risks to the purchasers;
                        a description of management;
                        material financial information; and
                        the SEC disclaimer.


                       SEC Disclaimer
                       The SEC reviews the prospectus to ensure that it contains the necessary material facts, but it

                                                                                                                                  Unit 20
                       does not guarantee the disclosure’s accuracy. Furthermore, the SEC does not approve the issue
                       but simply clears it for distribution. Implying that the SEC has approved the issue violates
                       federal law. Finally, the SEC does not pass judgment on the issue’s investment merit.

                                        The front of every prospectus must contain a clearly printed SEC disclaimer specifying the
                                        limits of the SEC’s review procedures. A typical SEC disclaimer clause reads as follows:

                                              These securities have not been approved or disapproved by the SEC or by any State
                                              Securities Commission nor has the SEC or any State Securities Commission passed
                                              upon the accuracy or adequacy of this prospectus. Any representation to the contrary is a
                                              criminal offense.

                                        The information supplied to the SEC becomes public once a registration statement is filed.
                                        If, at any time, the SEC believes that the registration statement is incomplete or has other
                                        problems, it may issue a stop order. This is not to be confused with the buy stop and sell stop
                                        orders discussed in Lesson 16.1. This stop order “stops” the registration process. Typically, a
                                        deficiency letter is sent, and if the deficiency is not cured by the stated deadline, the issue may
                                        be permanently halted.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    Anything that says the SEC approves or disapproves an issue of securities is wrong.
                                                    The SEC does not approve or disapprove—it clears or releases issues of securities for
                                                    sale. When the SEC has completed its review, the registration becomes effective.
                                                    Issuers and underwriters are responsible for the information found in the prospectus
                                                    and will conduct due diligence meetings to ensure that the prospectus is true and
                                                    accurate.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    Access equals delivery does not apply to registered investment companies. Physical
                                                    delivery must be made before or concurrent with the sales presentation.

                                                                period to ensure all registration requirements have been fully met.
                                                          B. the front of every prospectus must contain the SEC disclaimer.
                                                          C. the preliminary prospectus may be used to gather indications of interest.
                                                          D. the Securities Act of 1933 required nonexempt issuers of new securities to file
                                                                registration statements with the SEC.
                                                         Answer: A. The 20-day cooling-off period begins after the registration statement has
                                                         been filed, not before. The SEC disclaimer is printed on the front of the prospectus
                                                         and indications of interest may be gathered through the use of a preliminary
                                                         prospectus. Unless the issue qualifies for an exemption, it must register with the SEC.


                                        Summary Prospectus—SEC Rule 498
                                        When it comes to open-end investment companies, the physical delivery requirements can be
                                        met by delivery of a summary prospectus. A mutual fund can provide a summary prospectus
                                        to investors that may include an application investors can use to buy the fund’s shares.

                                        The summary prospectus is a standardized summary of key information found in the
                                        fund’s statutory (full) prospectus. Investors who receive the summary have the option of
                                        either purchasing fund shares using the application found therein or requesting a statutory
                                        prospectus. An investor who purchases fund shares on the basis of the summary prospectus
                                        must be able to access a statutory prospectus online. Remember, customers can always request

                       business days of receipt of the written request.

                       The summary must provide specific information in a particular sequence. Following is a list of
                       required disclosures:
                        Risk/return summary: investments, risks, and performance

                       Statement of Additional Information (SAI)
                       Although a prospectus is always sufficient for the purpose of selling shares, some investors may
                       wish to have additional information not found in the prospectus. This additional information
                       is not necessarily needed to make an informed investment decision but may be useful to the
                       investor.

                       An SAI must be available to investors upon request without charge. Investors can obtain a
                       copy by calling or writing to the investment company via a company website, contacting a
                       broker that sells the investment company shares, or contacting the SEC. If requested, a paper
                       copy must be sent within three days of the request.

                       The SAI affords the fund an opportunity to have expanded discussions on matters such as
                       the fund’s history and policies. It will also typically contain the fund’s consolidated financial
                       statements.

                                  TAKE NOTE
                                  The SAI must be available for open-end and closed-end companies. Exchange-traded
                                  funds (ETFs) also have SAIs, but not unit investment trusts (UITs).


                       Trust Indenture Act of 1939
                       The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 applies to corporate bonds (nonexempt) with the following
                       characteristics:
                        Issue size of more than $50 million within 12 months

                       for the benefit of the bondholders are carried out. The document is filed at the office of a
                       custodian so that investors may review it if they choose.

                                                    10. The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 covers which of the following securities transactions?
                                                         A. An offering of an issue of $5 billion worth of Treasury bonds maturing in 2040
                                                         B. A public issue of debentures worth $40 million sold by a single member firm
                                                             throughout the United States
                                                         C. A corporate bond issue worth $55 million sold interstate
                                                         D. The sale of an industrial revenue development bond issue of $62 million sold
                                                             in the tri-state area
                                                         Answer: C. The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 requires all corporate debt issues of $50
                                                         million or more sold interstate to have a trust indenture; U.S. Treasury issues and
                                                         municipal bonds (IDRs) are not corporate issues. That makes them exempt from the
                                                         provisions of this act.


           LESSON 20.3: MUNICIPAL BOND DOCUMENTATION
                                        LO 20.d Differentiate official statements, preliminary official statements (POS),
                                        and notice of sale for issuing municipal securities.



                                        Official Statement (OS)
                                        The MSRB defines an OS as:

                                              A document prepared by or on behalf of the issuer of municipal securities in
                                              connection with a primary offering that discloses material information on the
                                              offering of such securities. Official statements typically include information
                                              regarding the purposes of the issue, how the securities will be repaid, and the
                                              financial and economic characteristics of the issuer, conduit borrower or other
                                              obligated person with respect to the offered securities. Investors and market
                                              intermediaries may use this information to evaluate the credit quality of the
                                              securities and potential risks of the primary offering.
                                        From a practical standpoint, it is the equivalent of an SEC registered issuer’s prospectus, just
                                        with a different name.

                                        Municipal securities are exempt from the filing requirements of the Securities Act of 1933.
                                        However, like all other securities, they are subject to the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities
                                        Exchange Act of 1934. Therefore, a full and fair disclosure of material facts of the offering is
                                        still required.

                                        The full and fair disclosure document for municipal securities is called the official statement
                                        (OS) (there is no prospectus). There is no preliminary prospectus either for municipal
                                        securities, but there is a preliminary official statement. Just as with the red herring for an
                                        equity issue, underwriters use a preliminary OS to determine investors’ and dealers’ interest in
                                        the issue.

                                        Prepared by the issuer, the OS identifies the issue’s purpose, the source from which the
                                        interest and principal will be repaid, and the issuer’s and community’s financial and economic
                                        backgrounds. The OS also has information relating to the issue’s creditworthiness.

                        the purpose of the issue;

                        any specific provisions of the indenture or resolution, including funds and accounts,
                         investment of funds, additional bonds, insurance, and events of default;
                        any accompanying legal proceedings;
                        the tax status;
                        any appropriate appendices, including consultant reports, the legal opinion, and financial
                         statements; and
                        any credit enhancements.
                       With competitive bid underwritings, a municipality publishes an invitation to bid.
                       Investment bankers respond in writing to the issuer’s attorney or other designated official
                       requesting information on the offering. How do the potential underwriters know about the
                       new issue? Through an official notice of sale.


                       Official Notice of Sale
                       The official notice of sale to solicit bids for the bonds is usually published in The Bond Buyer
                       and local newspapers and includes
                        date, time, and place of sale;
                        name and description of issuer;
                        type of bond;
                        bidding restrictions (usually requiring a sealed bid);
                        interest payment dates;

                                       The bond’s rating and the underwriter’s name are not included in a notice of sale because they
                                       have yet to be determined.

                                       The investment bankers prepare bids for the securities based on information in the notice of
                                       sale, comparable new issue supply and demand, and general market conditions. As we have
                                       discussed, the winner is the underwriter whose bid represents the lowest cost to the issuers
                                       (either NIC or TIC).

                                       all information presented in the official notice of sale. It shows a schedule of year-by-year
                                       maturities and their corresponding dollar amounts and a computation of bond years.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   11. An investor purchases a new issue municipal bond. A copy of the official statement
                                                       (OS)
                                                        A. must precede the delivery of the bonds.
                                                        B. need only be delivered if requested in writing by the investor.
                                                        C. need not be delivered because an OS is not a prospectus.
                                                        D. must accompany or precede the delivery of the bonds.
                                                        Answer: D. The OS is the municipal industry’s disclosure document. It is most similar
                                                        to the prospectus used in corporate underwritings. MSRB rules require that a copy of
                                                        the OS must accompany or precede the delivery of the bonds.

                      Regulation A: Small and Medium Offerings
                      With the passage of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, a capital formation scheme was
                      called for that would further ease the requirements for small- and medium-sized companies to
                      raise capital. Previously known as Regulation A+, the new rule is now just Regulation A.

                      Regulation A provides two offering tiers for small- and medium-sized companies that will
                      allow the companies to raise capital.
                       Tier 1. Securities offerings up to $20 million in a 12-month period will be allowed.
                        Of the $20 million, no more than $6 million can be sold on behalf of existing selling
                        shareholders. The offering would be subject to a coordinated review by individual states
                        and the SEC and does not require audited financial statements.
                       Tier 2. Securities offerings up to $75 million in a 12-month period will be allowed. Of
                        the $75 million, no more than $22.5 million can be sold on behalf of existing selling
                        shareholders. These offerings are subject to SEC review only and none at the state level.
                        Tier 2 offerings are still subject to rigorous disclosure requirements to the SEC, including
                        audited financial statements, annual, semiannual, and current reports.

                      Offerings under both tiers are open to the public and general solicitation is permitted for both
                      tiers. However, Tier 2 investors must be qualified investors, and there are two ways to qualify:
                       Be an accredited investor as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D.
                       Limit the investment to a maximum of the greater of 10% of the investor’s net worth or
                        10% of the investor’s net income per offering. Note that self-certification for Tier 2 as to
                        net worth and income is all that is required with no burdensome filings. Tier 1 has no
                        investment limits.

                      Finally, remembering that the new Regulation A is intended for small- and medium-sized
                      companies, the regulation specifically excludes registered investment companies, including
                      business development companies (BDCs).

                      In a Regulation A offering, the issuer files an abbreviated notice of sale, or offering circular,
                      with the regional SEC office. Investors are provided with this offering circular rather than a
                      full prospectus.

                      The cooling-off period is 20 days between the filing date and effective date. Individuals buying
                      securities in a Regulation A offering must receive a final offering circular at least 48 hours
                      before confirmation of sale.

                                PRACTICE QUESTION
                                12. ABC, Inc., will be using Regulation A to offer $8 million of its common stock in its
                                    home state and in three other states. For the offering to be cleared for sale by the
                                    SEC, ABC must file
                                     A. an offering circular.
                                     B. a standard registration statement.
                                     C. a letter of notification.
                                     D. nothing.
                                     Answer: A. In a Regulation A offering, the issuer files an abbreviated notice of sale,
                                                                                                                                     Unit 20
                                     or offering circular, with the regional office of the SEC instead of with the SEC in
                                     Washington, D.C. It is this offering circular that is distributed to investors rather than a
                                     prospectus.

                                        Regulation D: Private Placements
                                        In a major effort aimed at facilitating the capital formation needs of small businesses, the
                                        SEC adopted Regulation D, the private placement exempt transaction. Securities offered and
                                        sold in compliance with Regulation D are exempt from registration with the SEC and are
                                        considered federal covered securities exempt from registration on the state level as well. Our
                                        primary concern is with SEC Rule 506, a private placement where there is no dollar limit on
                                        the amount sold.

                                        The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act, made several important
                                        changes to Rule 506 of Regulation D. Rule 506 consists of two sections, 506(b) and 506(c). A
                                        company seeking to raise capital through a private placement under Rule 506(b) can sell the
                                        offering to an unlimited number of accredited investors (definition following) and up to 35
                                        nonaccredited investors. In addition, no advertising may be done on behalf of the offering.

                                        On the other hand, Section 506(c) permits the offering to be advertised. There are two
                                        primary (and interrelated) requirements to do this:
                                         All purchasers are accredited investors, or the issuer reasonably believes that they are
                                          accredited investors.
                                         The issuer takes reasonable steps to verify that all purchasers are accredited investors,
                                          which could include reviewing documentation, such as W-2s, tax returns, bank and
                                          brokerage statements, credit reports and so forth.

                                        An issuer can elect to make a typical Rule 506 offering without general solicitation or
                                        advertising under Section 506(b) to include up to 35 nonaccredited investors in the offering
                                        or to avoid the heightened verification procedures.

                                        The JOBS Act also included a provision that an issuer is disqualified from using Rule 506
                                        under their bad actor provisions. Simply, if the issuer or other relevant persons (such as
                                        underwriters, directors, officers, or significant shareholders of the issuer), have been convicted
                                        of securities fraud or certain other securities violations, an offering under Rule 506 may not
                                        take place.


                                        SEC Rule 501 Accredited Investors
                                        SEC Rule 501 classifies an accredited investor for the purposes of Regulation D into several
                                        categories. Investors are considered to be accredited under the rule only if the issuer or any
                                        person acting on the issuer’s behalf has reasonable grounds to believe, and does believe after
                                        reasonable inquiry, that the investors are included in one of the categories in the definition.

                                        The separate categories of accredited investors under Regulation D include
                                         a bank, insurance company, or registered investment company;
                                         an employee benefit plan if a bank, insurance company, or registered investment adviser
                                          makes the investment decisions, or if the plan has total assets in excess of $5 million;
                                         a charitable organization, corporation, or partnership with assets exceeding $5 million;
                                         directors, executive officers, and GPs of the issuer;
                                         any natural person whose individual net worth, or joint net worth with that person’s
                                          spouse, excluding the net equity in his primary residence, exceeds $1 million at the time
                                          of his purchase;
                                         any natural person who had an individual income in excess of $200,000 in each of the
                                          two most recent years or joint income with that person’s spouse in excess of $300,000 in

                           the current year; and
                        entities made up of accredited investors.
                       The term accredited investor applies only to private placements. A favorite phrase of the
                       regulators is, “eligibility does not equal suitability.” Therefore, just because one meets the
                       financial requirements of an accredited investor does not mean that suitability standards are
                       ignored.

                                 Can assets in an account or property held jointly with another person who is not the
                                 purchaser’s spouse be included in determining whether the purchaser satisfies the net
                                 worth test in Rule 501?
                                 Answer: Yes, assets in an account or property held jointly with a person who is not the
                                 purchaser’s spouse may be included in the calculation for the net worth test, but only
                                 to the extent of her percentage ownership of the account or property.
                       Purchasers must have access to the same type of information they would receive if the
                       securities were being sold under prospectus in a registered offering. The amount of capital that
                       can be raised is unlimited.

                       A private placement investor must sign a letter stating that she intends to hold the stock for
                       investment purposes only. Private placement stock is called lettered stock because of this
                       investment letter. The certificate may bear a legend indicating that it cannot be transferred
                       without registration or exemption; therefore, private placement stock is also called legend
                       stock. There will be more on this when we cover Rule 144.

                       What is Form D, and when does it have to be filed? Under Rule 503 of Regulation D, an
                       issuer that is issuing securities in reliance on Regulation D must file Form D electronically
                       with the SEC no later than 15 days after the first sale of securities in the offering.

                       The SEC also specifies instances when an amended Form D should be filed, such as to correct
                       a mistake of fact or error or to reflect a change in information.

                                 Sometimes it is difficult to identify private placement stock in a question because of
                                 the many terms that can be used to describe it. Recognize all of the following terms as
                                 being synonymous with private placement stock:
                                     Restricted (because it must be held for a six-month period)
                                     Unregistered (no registration statement on file with the SEC)
                                     Letter stock (investor agreed to terms by signing an investment letter)

                                                         Answer: A. Form D is the form that must be filed electronically with the SEC no later
                                                         than 15 days after the first sale of securities in the offering.


                                        Rule 147: Intrastate Offerings
                                        Under Rule 147, offerings that take place entirely in one state are exempt from registration
                                        when
                                         the issuer has its principal office and receives at least 80% of its income in the state, or
                                         at least 80% of the issuer’s assets are located within the state, or
                                         at least 80% of the offering proceeds are used within the state, or
                                         a majority of the issuers’ employees are based within the state, and
                                         all purchasers are residents of the state.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    To qualify under the Rule 147 exemption, only one of the three 80% tests or the
                                                    majority of employees test noted earlier must be met. However, the 100% residents
                                                    rule always applies.

                                                    Purchasers of an intrastate issue may not resell the stock to any resident of another
                                                    state for at least six months after the purchase.


                                        Regulation S
                                        Offers and sales made outside the United States by both U.S. and foreign issuers are excluded
                                        from the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933. Because securities distributed
                                        offshore by issuers need not be registered with the SEC, they are therefore restricted for the
                                        purposes of Rule 144. To avoid registration under Regulation S
                                         the offer and sale must be made in an offshore transaction and
                                         there can be no directed selling efforts in the United States in connection with the
                                          offering.

                                        To be an offshore transaction, offers and sales cannot be made to any person or entity in the
                                        United States. However, U.S. citizens residing outside the United States could purchase these
                                        securities. All sales made under Regulation S must be reported to the SEC on Form 8-K.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    Regulation S addresses the sale of unregistered securities by U.S.-based issuers to
                                                    non-U.S. residents. A holding period on Regulation S securities is necessary to prevent
                                                    flow back into the United States. There is a holding period of either six months or
                                                    one year depending on the reporting status of the issuer. However, sales may be made
                                                    immediately to any SEC-designated offshore securities market.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    Regulation S applies to United States issuers. Foreign issuers are not subject to this
                                                    regulation if certain requirements are met. To be a foreign issuer, no more than 50%
                                                    of its voting securities and no more than 20% of its debt securities can be owned by
                                                    persons with a U.S. address. If a foreign issuer does not meet these requirements,

                                 it will be subject to the provisions of Regulation S (no sales to entities in the United
                                 States).


                       LO 20.f Determine the rules and regulations pertaining to the new issues market.



                       Shelf Registration (Rule 415)
                       Rule 415 of Regulation C of the Securities Act of 1933 permits issuers to quickly raise money
                       in the capital markets when needed or when market conditions are just right. The FINRA
                       exam outline refers to this as a “delayed or continuous offering and sale of securities.” For
                       example, if a company files a shelf registration statement with the SEC, there is no intention
                       to immediately sell the securities. However, when the right time arrives, such as interest rates
                       are at a low point, or funds are needed to complete the final phase of a large factory, the
                       company can take down the securities from the shelf without the delay of an SEC review. Just
                       keep it simple. Think about putting some canned goods on a shelf. They are there when you
                       need them without having to go to the store.

                                 EXAMPLE
                                 An issuer wants to sell $300 million of five-year AA/Aa2-rated notes, but only when
                                 market interest rates allow the sale to be made on a 6.40 basis. The current market
                                 shows that rates for five-year investment-grade notes are about 6.55. If the issuer
                                 waits for rates to fall 15 basis points and then files a registration statement with the
                                 SEC, rates may move back up before the registration is effective. To address this
                                 type of situation, an issuer files a shelf registration statement with the SEC, which,
                                 once effective, is good for two years. Therefore, as soon as rates fall, the issuer has
                                 an effective registration statement in place and can sell the five-year notes with little
                                 delay. This permits issuers to match financing needs with market conditions. For
                                 certain well-known issuers, the two-year period is extended to three years.


                       Rule 144
                       Rule 144 regulates the sale of control and restricted securities, stipulating the holding period,
                       quantity limitations, manner of sale, and filing procedures.

                       For purposes of Rule 144, control securities are those owned by directors, officers, or persons
                       who own or control at least 10% of the issuer’s voting stock. These are commonly referred to
                       as insiders.

                                 TAKE NOTE
                                 If an unaffiliated individual owns 7% of the voting stock of XYZ, that person is not a
                                 control person. However, if that person’s spouse owns 4% of the voting stock, then
                                 both would be considered control persons. In other words, if there is a 10% or more
                                 interest held by immediate family members, then all those family members owning

                                                                                                                                        Unit 20
                                 voting stock might be control persons. Please note that combining interests only
                                 applies to family members residing in the same home or being supported by or
                                 supporting the other family member.
                       Restricted securities are those acquired through some means other than a registered public
                       offering. A security purchased in a private placement is a restricted security. Restricted
                       securities may not be sold until they have been held fully paid for six months. According to
                       Rule 144, after holding restricted stock fully paid for six months, an affiliate may begin selling

                                        shares by submitting Form 144 but is subject to the volume restriction rules as enumerated as
                                        follows. In any 90-day period, an investor may sell the greater of
                                         1% of the total outstanding shares of the same class at the time of sale or
                                         the average weekly trading volume in the stock over the past four weeks on all exchanges
                                          or as reported through Nasdaq.

                                        There is a de minimis exemption under Rule 144. Form 144 need not be filed if 5,000 or
                                        fewer shares are sold or the dollar amount is $50,000 or less. The de minimis rule applies to
                                        sales in any 90-day period.

                                        After the six-month holding period, affiliated persons are subject to the volume restrictions
                                        for as long as they are affiliates. For unaffiliated investors, the stock may be sold completely
                                        unrestricted after the six-month holding period has been satisfied.

                                        Selling shares under Rule 144 effectively registers the shares. In other words, buyers of stock
                                        being sold subject to Rule 144 are not subject to any restrictions if they choose to resell.

                                                    When you encounter a Rule 144 question, always look for two things:
                                                         What kind of stock is being sold? (Restricted or control)
                                                         Who is selling it? (Insider or noninsider)
                                                    Only restricted stock has a holding period. Control stock, unless it is restricted, can be
                                                    sold immediately, but volume limits always apply.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    If an affiliate sells control stock for a profit without holding it at least six months, this is
                                                    called a short swing profit. If a short swing profit occurs, the affiliate must disgorge the
                                                    profit. This is an SEC rule that is not related to Rule 144, but applies to those people
                                                    who are control persons and sell unrestricted stock.
                                                    The term disgorged can certainly show up on an exam question. In this case, it means
                                                    the profit is returned to the issuer.

                       Rule 144A
                       Rule 144A allows nonregistered foreign and domestic securities to be sold to certain
                       institutional investors in the United States without holding period requirements. To qualify
                       for this exemption, the buyer must be a qualified institutional buyer (QIB). A QIB must
                       have a minimum of $100 million invested on a discretionary basis and cannot have any
                       affiliation with the entity selling the securities.

                                 PRACTICE QUESTION
                                 14. Which of the following persons is subject to the holding period provisions of Rule
                                     144?
                                      A. A corporate insider who has held restricted stock for two years
                                      B. A nonaffiliate who has held registered stock for three years
                                      C. A nonaffiliate who has held control stock for six months
                                      D. A nonaffiliate who has held restricted stock for three months
                                      Answer: D. Only restricted stock is subject to the six-month holding period for both
                                      affiliates and nonaffiliates. Neither registered shares nor control stock are subject to
                                      this holding period. The nonaffiliate who has only held the shares for three months
                                      will be subject to the holding period until the six-month requirement is met.


                       Protecting the Public and Restricted Persons Prohibitions
                       (FINRA Rule 5130)
                       FINRA Rule 5130 is designed to protect the integrity of the public offering process by
                       ensuring that
                        members make a bona fide public offering of securities at the POP;
                        members do not withhold securities in a public offering for their own benefit or use such
                         securities to reward persons who are in a position to direct future business to the member;
                         and
                        industry insiders, such as members and their associated persons, do not take advantage
                         of their insider status to gain access to new issues for their own benefit at the expense of
                         public customers.

                       The rule applies only to a new issue, which is defined to mean any IPO of equity securities.
                       The rule does not apply to additional issue offerings, debt securities, restricted or exempt
                       securities, convertible securities, preferred stock, investment company securities, offerings of
                       business development companies, direct participation companies, and real estate investment
                       trusts (REITs). Essentially, the rule applies to IPOs of common stock.
                       The rule prohibits member firms from selling a new issue to any account where restricted
                       persons are beneficial owners. Restricted persons are defined as follows:
                        Member firms
                        Employees of member firms
                        Finders and fiduciaries acting on behalf of the managing underwriter, including attorneys,
                                                                                                                                      Unit 20
                         accountants, financial consultants, and so forth
                        Portfolio managers, including any person who has the authority to buy or sell securities
                         for a bank, savings and loan association, insurance company, or investment company
                        Any person owning 10% or more of a member firm

           534         Unit 20   The New Issues Market



                                        Furthermore, any immediate family member of any person in bullet points two through five
                                        is also restricted. Immediate family includes parents, in-laws, spouses, siblings, children, or
                                        any other individual to whom the person provides material support. Unlike control stock,
                                        residence is not a requirement. Giving or receiving support is a requirement, and living in the
                                        same home generally would make a family member restricted.

                                        There is an important exemption. The prohibitions on the purchase and sale of new issues
                                        must not apply to securities that are specifically directed by the issuer. When a company goes
                                        public, it is good business practice to make shares available to employees, many of who would
                                        not normally be able to purchase new issues. However, these shares may not be directed to
                                        restricted persons.

                                        Finally, there is a de minimis exemption. If the beneficial interests of restricted persons do
                                        not exceed 10% of an account, the account may purchase a new equity issue. In other words,
                                        restricted persons will be able to have an interest in an account that purchases new equity
                                        issues as long as no more than 10% of the account’s beneficial owners are restricted persons.

                                        Spinning is the practice of allocating highly sought after IPO shares to individuals who
                                        are in a position to direct securities business to the firm. This is why portfolio managers are
                                        categorized as restricted persons. These individuals are in a position to direct business to a firm
                                        and may be willing to do so on the basis of the size of their allocation.

                                        Before selling an IPO to any account, representatives are required to obtain a written
                                        representation from the account owner(s) that the account is eligible to purchase a new
                                        common stock issue at the POP. All representations must be obtained within the 12-month
                                        period before the sale of the new issue and must be retained for at least three years following
                                        the new issue sale.

                                        Do not confuse spinning with spoofing, which FINRA defines as an investor entering orders
                                        to purchase or sell stock but canceling the orders before they are executed. This is considered a
                                        form of market manipulation.

              MUTUAL FUND CUSTOMER SUITABILITY QUIZ
              Joe Smith is a registered representative with ABC Investments, Inc. Last week, Joe opened accounts for 10 new
              customers. Each customer wants Joe to recommend the best mutual fund that he can find.
              Joe knows that the best mutual fund for one customer is not necessarily the best choice for every customer. Before he
              makes a recommendation, he collects important information about the customers’ needs, goals, and financial status.
              For example, Joe asks each customer:
               What is your income?
               How stable is your income?
               What plans do you have for the money you invest?
               What kinds of risks are you comfortable taking?
               How liquid must your investments be?
               How important are tax considerations?
               Are you seeking long-term or short-term investments?
               What is your investment experience?
              After Joe has noted a customer’s financial status and investment objectives, he can begin to search for the most
              appropriate mutual fund. Joe has prepared a brief description of each of his 10 new customers, and this is followed
              by a list of top-performing mutual funds in 10 categories.
              Which mutual fund would you recommend to each of Joe’s customers? After you have read the descriptions of the
              customers and the funds, answer each question based on which fund best meets the customer’s objectives. Fund
              descriptions are listed after the questions.

              The Customers
                 1. Andy Jones, 52, and Patty Jones, 56, have a large investment portfolio concentrated in stocks and stock mutual
                    funds, including an international fund. They maintain their cash reserves in a money market account at their
                    local bank. Andy is employed as a consultant, where he earns a $400,000 a year salary. The Joneses are seeking
                    a safe investment because they will need to liquidate a portion of their portfolio when Andy retires in about
                    five years. They also recognize the need for additional diversification of their portfolio.

                    C. Spencer Tax-Free Municipal Bond Fund
                    D. MacDonald Stock Index Fund

                 2. Sarah Davis, 30, and Jim Davis, 32, have been married four years. Both work and they have no children, so
                    their disposable income is relatively high. They live in the suburbs and plan to buy a condominium downtown
                    so they can enjoy some of their favorite activities on the weekends. They need a safe place to invest the amount
                    they have saved for their down payment for about six months while they shop for the perfect unit.

              3. Adam Garcia is 26 and earns $45,000 a year as an advertising executive. He already has accumulated $5,000
                 in a savings account and is seeking a secure place to invest the amount and begin a periodic investment plan.
                 He knows his long-term time frame means he should be willing to take some risk, but he is uncomfortable
                 with the thought of losing money. Adam would prefer moderate overall returns rather than high returns
                 accompanied by high volatility.

                 Security benefits and his company pension plan. Mark is a Depression-era grandfather of six with a
                 conservative attitude toward investments. An equally important goal for him is capital preservation.

              5. Helen Wong is 29 and is seeking a long-term growth investment. She is concerned about the loss of purchasing
                 power as a result of inflation and often complains about high commissions and charges that reduce her
                 investment returns. When she was in college, she took a few economics courses and firmly believes that
                 securities analysts cannot consistently outperform the overall market.

                 accumulating money to provide for their children’s education. Their oldest child will enter college in four
                 years and they are not willing to take risks with the money they worked hard to accumulate. They need a safe

                 year and are looking forward to an active retirement. They have accumulated a nest egg of about $1 million,
                 which they plan to use to travel the world, pursue their hobbies, and care for their health. Both are concerned
                 about rising inflation and are comfortable with a reasonable level of risk.

                 consists of common stocks and bonds that offer a wide range of safety and return potential. The Cains are
                 becoming even more concerned about the effects of rising inflation in the U.S. economy. They are seeking to
                 invest a small percentage of their portfolio in a fund that will provide additional diversification.

                   of money a few years ago and has taken an active interest in managing her investments. Her portfolio is
                   diversified among common stocks, tax-exempt bonds, international investments, and limited partnerships. She
                   has a long-term time frame and is not averse to risk.

              The Mutual Funds (Listed Alphabetically)
              ATF Biotechnology Fund. The fund seeks maximum capital appreciation through investment in stocks of
              companies providing innovative products in the biotechnology sector, including pharmaceutical developers and
              medical equipment suppliers. Fund management seeks to evaluate emerging economic and political trends and to
              select individual companies that may benefit from technological advances.
              ATF Capital Appreciation Fund. The fund seeks to achieve maximum capital appreciation with little or no
              pursuit of current income. The fund invests in stocks of small- and medium-size companies that demonstrate
              significant long-term growth potential. The fund’s management believes that despite year-to-year fluctuations, the
              strategy of investing in companies that show strong earnings growth can result in superior investment returns.
              ATF Overseas Opportunities Fund. The fund seeks maximum capital appreciation by investing in common stocks
              of companies located outside the United States. The management selects well-established companies that are listed on
              their native stock exchanges and that have demonstrated high earnings potential. Although the fund may be affected
              by fluctuations in currency exchange rates, over the long-term it may provide protection against downturns in U.S.
              markets.
              Laramie Equity Income Fund. The fund seeks primarily current income, with secondary objectives of capital
              growth and growth of income. Its portfolio consists of common stock, preferred stock, and convertible securities of
              large, well-established companies with a history of paying high dividends. Its equity concentration can help protect
              against the loss of purchasing power owing to inflation.
              MacDonald Balanced Fund. The fund seeks to preserve capital, to generate current income, and to provide long-
              term capital growth. Its strategy is to invest 60% of its portfolio in common stocks and 40% in bonds and fixed-
              income securities. Through diversification, the fund intends to provide protection against downturns in the market.
              In its endeavors to produce positive returns during market decline, the fund may not participate fully in rising stock
              markets.
              MacDonald Investment-Grade Bond Fund. The fund seeks high current yield (CY) accompanied by reasonable
              risk. It invests most of its portfolio in corporate bonds having one of the top three ratings according to Moody’s and
              Standard & Poor’s. It seeks to reduce the risk associated with interest rate fluctuations by investing a portion of its
