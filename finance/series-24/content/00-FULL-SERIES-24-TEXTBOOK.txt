                  ❚ INTRODUCTION
                                   Thank you for choosing this exam preparation system for your educational needs, and
                               welcome to the Series 24 License Exam Manual. This manual has applied adult learning prin-
                               ciples to give you the tools you’ll need to pass your exam on the first attempt.
                                   Some of these special features include:
                               ■■ exam-focused questions and content to maximize exam preparation;
                               ■■ an interactive design that integrates content with questions to increase retention; and
                               ■■ integrated SecuritiesProTM QBank exam preparation tools to sharpen test-taking skills.


                               Why Do I Need to Pass the Series 24 Exam?
                                   FINRA and other self-regulatory organizations require certain employees of its members
                               to pass a qualification exam to become registered as a General Securities Principal. You must
                               pass the Series 24 exam to be qualified to supervise most activities of a member firm including
                               trading, market making, investment banking, sales, and approval of communications with the
                               public.


                               Are There Any Prerequisites?
                                   You must pass the Series 7, or any of the Series 17, Series 37, Series 38, Series 62, Series 79,
                               or Series 82 exams before sitting for the Series 24.


                               What Is the Series 24 Exam Like?
                                    The Series 24 is a 3¾-hour, 150-question exam administered by FINRA. It is offered as a
                               computer-based exam at Prometric or Pearson VUE testing centers around the country. Each
                               examination includes 10 additional, unidentified “tryout” questions that do not count toward
                               your score. Those questions are randomly distributed. You will, therefore, be asked a total of
                               160 questions, of which 150 questions are scored. Series 24 questions come in three types:
                               closed-stem (i.e., those questions that end with a question mark), open-stem (i.e., those ques-
                               tions that end in a colon), and “except” or “not” questions. Furthermore, the test points to
                               supervisory and management issues rather than those topics seen on the Series 7 examination.
                               For instance, the characteristics of a defined-benefit retirement plan or the rights that accrue
                               to stock owners is not directly tested, but you are expected to know.


                               What Score Must I Achieve to Pass?
                                   You need a score of at least 70% on the Series 24 exam to pass and become eligible for
                               registration as a General Securities Principal.

       xii         Introduction



                               What Topics Will I See on the Exam?
                                   The questions you will see on the Series 24 exam do not appear in any particular order.
                               The computer is programmed to select a new, random set of questions for each exam taker
                               according to the preset topic weighting of the exam. Each Series 24 candidate will see the
                               same number of questions on each topic but will see a different mix of questions. The Series
                               24 exam is divided into five areas of supervision and compliance:

                                                                                                                    Number of

                                  When you complete your exam, you will receive a printout that identifies your perfor-
                               mance in each area.




       ❚ PREPARING FOR THE EXAM
                               How Is the License Exam Manual Organized?
                                   The License Exam Manual consists of Units and Unit Tests. In addition to the regular
                               text, each Unit has some unique features designed to help you with quick recognition of the
                               material. When an additional point will be valuable to your comprehension, special notes are
                               embedded in the text. Examples of these are included below.

                                                    you will see on the actual examination. Answers and rationales for the Quick Quizzes
                                                    can be found at the end of each Unit.


                                    Additional Study Resources
                                        To accompany and supplement your License Exam Manual, your study package may con-
                                    tain additional study resources. Be sure to spend some time on your homepage, view the best
                                    practices video, and understand all that is available to help you study.

                                        SecuritiesPro™ QBank

                                        Coordinating with the LEM, the SecuritiesProTM QBank includes a large number of ques-
                                    tions that are similar in style and content to those you will encounter on the exam. You may
                                    use it to generate tests by a spe­cific unit or combination of units. The QBank also allows you to
                                    create Weighted Mock Exams that mimic your test. There is no limit on the number of QBank
                                    exams you can create.

                                        Practice and Mastery Exams

                                        Depending on the study package purchased, you may also have a fixed Practice Exam or a
                                    fixed Practice and Mastery Exam. These exams are designed to closely replicate the true exam
                                    experience, both in terms of the degree of difficulty and topical coverage. They provide scores
                                    and diagnostic feedback, but you will not be given access to, or be able to obtain from Kaplan,
                                    correct answers or question explanations. The Practice and Mastery Exams are sound indica-
                                    tors of potential actual exam scores—the better you do on these exams, the more likely you
                                    are to pass your actual exam. These may be taken just once each.

                                        Video Library

                                        You may also have access to various topics from our video library. These short, engaging
                                    videos cover key topics from your manual. If your package includes access to our video library,
                                    please review the topics as you complete your reading assignments in the study manual.

       xiv         Introduction



                               What Topics Are Covered in the Course?
                                   The License Exam Manual consists of 5 Units, each devoted to a particular area of study
                               that you will need to know to pass the Series 24 exam. Each Unit is divided into study sections
                               devoted to more specific areas with which you need to become familiar.


                               How Much Time Should I Spend Studying?
                                   Plan to spend approximately 60–80 hours reading the material and carefully answering
                               the questions. Spread your study time over the 3–4 weeks before the date on which you are
                               scheduled to take the Series 24 exam. Your actual time may vary depending on your reading
                               rate, comprehension, professional background, and study environment.


                               What Is the Best Way to Structure My Study Time?
                                    The following schedule is suggested to help you obtain maximum retention from your
                               study efforts. Remember, this is a guideline only, because each individual may require more or
                               less time to complete the steps included.

                                  Step 1. Read a Unit and complete the Unit Test. Review rationales for all questions
                               whether you got them right or wrong.

                                   Step 2. In the SecuritiesProTM QBank, create a minimum of two 40-question exams for
                               each unit as you go. Carefully review all rationales. Use the reference number to locate addi-
                               tional or related information on the test topic in your LEM, if needed (2–3 hours per Unit).
                               ■■ Do not become too overwhelmed or bogged down in any one unit. You don’t want to lose
                                   sight of the finish line because you’re having trouble with one hurdle. Keep moving for-
                                   ward. It’s a steady pace that wins the race.
                               ■■ View rationales after each question initially and spend time studying each rationale in
                                   order to learn the concepts. Later, you will want to create exam scenarios in which scores
                                   and rationales are viewed at the end of each exam.
                               ■■ Perfection is not the goal during the reading phase; scores in the mid- to high-60s is good
                                   initially.

                                   Step 3. When you have completed all the Units and their Unit Tests in the License
                               Exam Manual, using the Securities ProTM QBank, concentrate on comprehensive exams
                               covering all the material. With your comprehensive testing, it is best to view correct answers
                               and rationales only after the test is completed. Plan to spend at least one week testing prior
                               to a scheduled class (~2 hours for every 100 questions).
                               ■■ You should complete at least 10 Weighted Mock Exams prior to class. Review your answers
                                   and rationales. Also, review your LEM and video library as needed.
                               ■■ Your goal is to consistently score in the 80s.

                                   Step 4. Complete online Practice and Mastery exams. You should complete each exam
                               while observing the time limits for the actual exam. Upon completing the exam, you will
                               receive a diagnostic report that identifies topics for further review (3–4 hours per exam).
                               We recommend taking the Practice Exam prior to a scheduled class and taking the Mastery
                               Exam afterward.

                                   Step 5. Rules change continually. On the Kaplan website, there are a number of impor-
                               tant tools to keep you current. The Exam-tips, Content Updates, and Corrections links are
                               valuable assets that should be checked often.

                               How Well Can I Expect to Do?
                                   The exams administered by FINRA are not easy. You must display considerable knowledge
                               of the topics presented in this course to pass the exam and qualify for registration.
                                   If you study diligently, complete all sections of the course, and consistently score in the 80s
                               on the tests, you should be well prepared to pass the exam. However, it is important for you
                               to realize that merely knowing the materials will not enable you to pass unless you can apply
                               your knowledge to the questions you are given and comprehend and interpret the essence of
                               the information behind the question.


                               Test-Taking Tips
                                   Passing the exam depends not only on how well you learn the subject matter but also on
                               how well you take exams. You can develop your test-taking skills—and improve your score—
                               by learning the following test-taking techniques:
                               ■■ Read the full question
                               ■■ Avoid jumping to conclusions—watch for hedge clauses
                               ■■ Interpret the unfamiliar question
                               ■■ Look for key words and phrases
                               ■■ Identify the intent of the question
                               ■■ Memorize key points
                               ■■ Use a calculator
                               ■■ Avoid changing answers
                               ■■ Pace yourself

                                  Each of these pointers is explained in the following subsections, including examples that
                               show how to use them to improve your performance on the exam.


                               Read the Full Question
                                   You cannot expect to answer a question correctly if you do not know what it is asking. If
                               you see a question that seems familiar and easy, you might anticipate the answer, mark it, and
                               move on before you finish reading it. This is a serious mistake. Be sure to read the full question
                               before answering it—questions often are written to trap people who assume too much.


                               Avoid Jumping to Conclusions—Watch for Hedge Clauses
                                  The questions on FINRA exams often are embellished with deceptive distractors as
                               choices. To avoid being misled by seemingly obvious answers, make it a practice to read each
                               question and each answer twice before selecting your choice. Doing so will provide you with a
                               much better chance of doing well on the exam.

       xvi         Introduction



                                   Watch out for hedge clauses embedded in the question. (Examples of hedge clauses
                               include the terms if, not, all, none, and except.) In the case of if statements, the question can
                               be answered correctly only by taking into account the qualifier. If you ignore the qualifier, you
                               will not answer correctly.
                                   Qualifiers are sometimes combined in a question. Some that you will frequently see
                               together are all with except and none with except. In general, when a question starts with all
                               or none and ends with except, you are looking for an answer that is opposite to what the ques-
                               tion appears to be asking.


                               Interpret the Unfamiliar Question
                                   Do not be surprised if questions on the exam seem unfamiliar at first. If you have studied
                               your material, you will have the information to answer all of the questions correctly. The chal-
                               lenge may be a matter of understanding what the question is asking.
                                   Very often, questions present information indirectly. You may have to interpret the
                               meaning of certain elements before you can answer the question. Be aware that the exam
                               will approach a concept from different angles and will often expect you to make decisions
                               from scant and imperfect information in similitude of the day-to-day work life of a General
                               Securities Principal of broker-dealers.


                               Look for Key Words and Phrases
                                   Look for words that are tip-offs to the situation presented. For example, if you see the word
                               prospectus in the question, you know the question is about a new issue. Sometimes, a question
                               will even supply you with the answer if you can recognize the key words it contains. Few ques-
                               tions provide blatant clues, but many do offer key words that can guide you to selecting the
                               correct answer if you pay attention. Be sure to read all instructional phrases carefully.
                                   Take time to identify the key words to answer this type of question correctly.


                               Identify the Intent of the Question
                                   Many questions on FINRA exams supply so much information that you lose track of what
                               is being asked; this is often the case in story problems. Learn to separate the story from the
                               question.
                                   Take the time to identify what the question is asking. Of course, your ability to do so
                               assumes you have studied sufficiently. There is no method for correctly answering questions if
                               you don’t know the material.


                               Memorize Key Points
                                   Principal-level examinations demand careful reasoning and logic to answer many ques-
                               tions, but you also will have to memorize a good deal of information. Keep in mind, however,
                               that this test values your skill as to how to apply a variety of rules and how they work together
                               to solve supervisory and compliance issues. Industry regulators are concerned that principals
                               recognize the importance of building a culture of compliance and are able to establish and test
                               policies and procedures that will reasonably assure compliance with the securities laws and
                               SRO regulations.

                               Use a Calculator
                                   For the most part, FINRA exams will not require the use of a calculator. Most of the ques-
                               tions are written so that any arithmetic required is simple. However, if you have become accus-
                               tomed to using a calculator, you will be provided with a basic one by the testing center staff.


                               Avoid Changing Answers
                                  If you are unsure of an answer, your first hunch is the one most likely to be correct. Do not
                               change answers on the exam without good reason. In general, change an answer only if you:
                               ■■ discover that you did not read the question correctly; or
                               ■■ find new or additional helpful information in another question.


                               Pace Yourself
                                    Some people will finish the exam early, and some do not have time to finish all of the
                               questions. Watch the time carefully (your time remaining will be displayed on your computer
                               screen) and pace yourself throughout the exam, because it is important to finish the exam. It
                               is a common experience that the easier questions appear at the beginning and at the end of
                               the examination.
                                    Do not waste time by dwelling on a question if you do not know the answer. Make the
                               best guess you can, mark the question for Record for Review, and return to the question if
                               time allows. Ensure that you have time to read all of the questions so that you can record the
                               answers you do know.

                   1. 1       REGISTRATION OF A BROKER-DEALER AND
                              PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES
                                   On July 26, 2007, the SEC approved the consolidation of NASD and NYSE Regulation,
                               Inc., into a single self-regulatory organization (SRO) known as Financial Industry Regulatory
                               Authority, or FINRA. The purpose of the regulatory consolidation was to:
                               ■■ eliminate duplicate regulation by NASD and NYSE; and
                               ■■ strengthen the competitiveness of U.S. markets.

                                    Although securities licensing exams may refer to FINRA when speaking of the industry’s
                               SRO, you will see exam questions that point to both continuing NASD or incorporated NYSE
                               rules. It is expected that this will continue until all of the individual rules of NASD and NYSE
                               have been consolidated; this process has been going on for years and will likely go on for
                               many more. Each rule change must be vetted and approved by the Securities and Exchange
                               Commission (SEC, or simply Commission).
                                    NYSE Regulation, Inc. continues to operate but focuses principally on uniquely NYSE
                               listing and trading floor issues, such as listed-company corporate governance and trading floor
                               integrity (such as tracking and monitoring handheld E-Broker devices). NYSE Regulation also
                               monitors the performance of the regulatory services allotted to FINRA.
                                    FINRA has a huge role to play. They work to provide an environment where investors
                               feel safe and confident in going into orderly markets where risk is managed. It regulates about
                               4,200 brokerage firms and 630,000 registered representatives. One way that FINRA looks
                               to achieve its aims is to ensure that those persons entering the securities business are quali-
                               fied. This unit of the Licensing Exam Manual (LEM) covers the registration and qualification
                               processes, and the follow-up supervisory issues that come with ensuring that firms and their
                               principals look to build a culture of compliance.
                                    FINRA operates under the oversight of the United States Securities and Exchange
                               Commission (SEC), which is a government agency. FINRA is not a government agency and
                               receives no government funding. The following list outlines some of the important parts of
                               FINRA’s mission.
                                    FINRA has the obligation or authority to:
                               ■■ establish and interpret rules regulating the over-the-counter markets;
                               ■■ take appropriate steps to ensure compliance with these rules;
                               ■■ examine and investigate members and their associated persons to determine if they have
                                    violated FINRA or MSRB rules, federal securities law, or state regulations;
                               ■■ dispute resolutions;
                               ■■ administer qualification exams and continuing education programs;
                               ■■ operate the Central Registration Depository (CRD);
                               ■■ determine if applicants for membership meet FINRA guidelines;
                               ■■ determine whether persons seeking to register are subject to statutory disqualification;
                               ■■ establish fees and other assessments to be levied on member firms;
                               ■■ own both quote and trade reporting facilities (TRF), such as the Over the Counter Bul-
                                    letin Board (OTCBB), OTC Reporting Facility (ORF), TRACE, the Alternative Display
                                    Facility (ADF), FINRA/NASDAQ TRF, and the FINRA/NYSE TRF;
                               ■■ market data;
                               ■■ educate industry professionals and investors; and
                               ■■ oversee investor protection services, such as BrokerCheck®. (FINRA member firms that
                                    hold customer funds or securities must supply FINRA’s BrokerCheck® hotline number and
                                    FINRA’s website address.)

       1. 1. 1                 REGISTERING AS A FINRA MEMBER
                                   With limited exceptions, broker-dealers must be registered with the SEC, FINRA, and the
                               states (and U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico, Guam, etc.) in which it operates. The registra-
                               tion process begins by an online filing with FINRA of a new membership application (Form
                               NMA) through the FINRA Firm Gateway. Filing the Form NMA opens a 180-day application
                               review period. This undertaking should not be taken lightly. As you will see, the application
                               process, including changes to existing membership agreements, is challenging and demands a
                               great deal of preparation and disciplined, robust thinking.

                                                         The term broker means any person engaged in the business of effecting transac-
                                                    tions in securities for the accounts of others. Those persons acting on behalf of their
                                                    own proprietary trading account are acting as dealers. In most cases, broker-dealers
                                                    register with the SEC, the states where they operate, and the appropriate designated
                                                    examining authority (DEA), such as FINRA. The expression broker-dealer is often ab-
                                                    breviated as BD on the exam.

                                                          An investment adviser is a person who, for compensation, advises others directly
                                                    or through publications or writings, as to the value of securities or as to the advis-
                                                    ability of purchasing or selling securities, or who, for compensation and as part of a
                                                    regular business, issues or promulgates analyses or reports concerning securities. They
                                                    may be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission or the states subject
                                                    to certain conditions. Unlike broker-dealers, investment advisers do not register with
                                                    FINRA. There is no SRO for IAs. Form ADV is used by investment advisers to register
                                                    with both the SEC and state securities authorities.

                                   To satisfy the requirement to apply online, the applicant must be “entitled.” To become
                               entitled, the applicant must complete and submit certain hardcopy forms. This includes an
                               email notification contact form and a notarized Form BD. Form BD is the Uniform Application
                               for Broker-Dealers to register with the SEC, SROs, and states through the Central Registration
                               Depository (CRD) system, operated by FINRA. Broker-dealers are required to promptly (no
                               later than 30 days) update Form BD whenever the form becomes inaccurate or incomplete. If a
                               member firm has a change in ownership, control, or business operations, it must electronically
                               submit a Form CMA.

            TEST TOPIC ALERT
                            !                            FINRA regulates the trading of over-the-counter (OTC) nonexempt securities.
                                                    Firms that transact business in nonexempt securities must register with FINRA and

                                                    (MSRB) provide registration and operating rules, as well as reporting transparency ser-

                                    Once registered, a broker-dealer needs to remain operationally healthy. It may not affect
                               any transaction or induce a trade in a security unless it maintains acceptable standards of
                               operational capability. All their associated persons must likewise meet acceptable standards
                               of training, experience, and competence to operate in the public interest.
                                    In a fashion similar to the Form BD being used to register a broker-dealer, the Form BR
                               (Uniform Branch Office Registration Form) is used specifically for branch office registration.
                                    Broker-dealers and investment advisers must use this form to register or notice file their
                               branch offices in the appropriate jurisdictions and/or with SROs. Access to the Form is
                               gained electronically through the FINRA Firm Gateway.
                                    Information that must be entered into the form includes the following:
                               ■■ Supervisor/person-in-charge CRD number
                               ■■ Whether the person-in-charge is physically located at the branch
                               ■■ The branch location
                               ■■ OSJ, non-OSJ, branch telephone number
                               ■■ Type of branch registration (i.e. broker-dealer or investment adviser)
                               ■■ Jurisdiction (i.e. FINRA, NYSE or both)

                                   Providing this information gives FINRA and/or the NYSE accurate data regarding branch
                               operations, lines of business, supervisory capability, et cetera.
                                   A branch office may be a private residence. FINRA policy is that private residences regis-
                               tered as branch offices have their addresses disclosed through BrokerCheck®.
                                   If a member firm’s management chooses to close/withdraw a branch, it uses the exact same
                               Form BR. This is unlike the Form BDW, which is filed when the entire firm chooses to cease
                               doing business and/or withdraw from registration with the SEC, FINRA, and the states.

                                                      FINRA requires that there be at least one resident principal at each Office of
                                                 Supervisory Jurisdiction. (See Unit 2 for more about OSJs.) The rules do not require the
                                                 “person-in-charge” to be a principal at all non-OSJ branch offices. A properly qualified
                                                 registered representative can manage the branch, but the location must be under the
                                                 supervision of an OSJ or supervising branch. Note that FINRA must be notified within
                                                 30 days of the relocation or opening of a new branch and the filing of Form BR.

                                                         FINRA (or appropriate SRO) is required by the SEC to conduct an inspection of
                                                    the newly registered member firm within six months of the member’s registration with
                                                    the Commission to ascertain whether the member is operating in conformity with
                                                    financial responsibility rules.


             1. 1. 1. 2             Statutory Disqualifications
                                   Disciplinary sanctions within the previous 10 years by the SEC, another SRO, a foreign
                               financial regulator, or a state or federal law enforcement agency can be cause for statutory dis-
                               qualification (SD) from FINRA membership indefinitely.

                                  The Firm. The firm will be denied membership if the applicant or any associated person:
                               ■■ has been expelled or suspended by another SRO or from the foreign equivalent of an SRO;
                               ■■ is subject to an SEC order denying, suspending, or revoking registration as a broker-dealer;
                                  or
                               ■■ has willfully filed a false or misleading application or has failed to disclose material facts.

                                   Individuals. An individual will be disqualified as an applicant for registration if the
                               individual:
                               ■■ has made willful misstatements or omissions of fact in an application for membership or
                                   registration as an associated person (e.g., willful failure to disclose on the Form U-4 the
                                   receipt of a Wells Notice);
                               ■■ has been subject to a felony conviction (domestic or foreign), or a misdemeanor convic-
                                   tion involving securities or money, within the past 10 years;
                               ■■ is under court injunctions prohibiting the individual from acting as an investment adviser,
                                   underwriter, or broker-dealer or in other capacities aligned with the securities and finan-
                                   cial services industry;
                               ■■ has been suspended or expelled from membership or participation in another SRO or from
                                   the foreign equivalent of an SRO;
                               ■■ is under an SEC order or an order of a foreign financial regulator denying, suspending, or
                                   revoking his registration or barring him from association with a broker-dealer; or
                               ■■ is the cause of another broker-dealer’s or associated person’s expulsion or suspension from
                                   another SRO, the SEC, or the foreign equivalent of an SRO.

                                    A member firm that wishes to sponsor a person who, for example, was permanently barred
                               or convicted of a felony, to enter or be retained as an associate must apply to FINRA on Form
                               MC-400. FINRA then may propose to admit or allow a person to continue as an associate
                               with a member regardless of a statutory disqualification. When that happens, the SRO must
                               file a notice with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A statutory disqualification now
                               includes non-securities-related felonies, such as DUI or assault (often referred to as “other
                               felonies”); and although it is a felony conviction, it does not pose a risk to investors and does
                               not necessarily therefore preclude someone from working in the securities industry. Subject to
                               review requirements of SEC Rule 19h-1, they may be able to work in the industry.
                                    Another option for continued employment in the securities industry is available for statu-
                               torily disqualified persons. As previously stated, the member firm may pay a fee and file Form
                               MC-400 with FINRA’s Department of Registration and Disclosure (RAD) requesting a statu-
                               torily disqualified person to remain in the industry.

                                      to the NAC. In the event of an adverse decision by the Department of Member Regulation,
                                      the firm may request a hearing by the Statutory Disqualification Committee and then may
                                      appeal to the NAC. Member firms that are successful in their petition to permit an otherwise
                                      disqualified person to remain employed as an associated person must pay to FINRA a fee of
                                      $1,500 annually when such person or individual is classified as a Tier 1 statutorily disqualified
                                      individual (most serious offender), and an annual fee of $1,000 when such person or individual
                                      is classified as a Tier 2 statutorily disqualified individual.

                                   arbitration settled for an amount in excess of $15,000 ($25,000 if the defendant/respon-
                                   dent is the member firm itself);
                                ■■ become subject to a statutory disqualification; or
                                ■■ are the subject of in-house disciplinary action involving suspension, termination, with-
                                   holding of commissions, or fines in excess of $2,500.

                                    Once admitted to membership, a firm must ensure that its Form BD remains current.
                                Amendments to this form (e.g., change in address, phone numbers, ownership, officers, branch
                                openings or closings) must be made within 30 days.
                                    Each member must designate to FINRA an executive representative who is a senior offi-
                                cer entitled to represent, vote, and act for the member in all the affairs of FINRA. The execu-
                                tive representative must be a registered principal and maintain an internet email account for
                                communication with FINRA. The “ER” does not need to be the principal executive officer.
                                    New members may feel relief from the burden of the application process. That relief is
                                generally short lived, as FINRA examiners will regularly visit the firm to ascertain whether
                                the firm is in compliance with all applicable rules. Examiners generally ask the compliance
                                department of the firm for a list of items to be prepared prior to their arrival. Firms are obli-
                                gated under FINRA Rule 8210 to provide any requested documents; failure to do so could lead
                                to serious consequences. The rule also requires that any information provided to examiners
                                on a portable media device be encrypted (256-bit or higher). The process or key must then be
                                provided to FINRA staff in a separate email, fax, or letter.
                                    The Form BDW is used to withdraw from registration as a broker-dealer. Prior to filing
                                a BDW, the firm is obligated to update Form BD for any inaccurate information. The notice
                                of withdrawal becomes effective generally on the 60th day from filing unless the SEC imposes
                                terms and conditions it deems necessary to the public interest.

                        1. 1. 1. 4    Restriction Agreement
                                       Most new membership approvals are granted with restrictions imposed. Over time, mem-
                                   bers may seek to have restrictions from their membership agreements removed if the circum-
                                   stances giving rise to particular prohibitions have changed.




                               *
                               EXAMPLE                 If an applicant does not have a registered options principal, it will be prohibited
                                                  from engaging in any options business. Likewise, if the applicant’s level of capital is
                                                  not high enough, it will be prohibited from engaging in certain types of underwrit-
                                                  ings. In both cases, the member was unable to satisfy one or more of the standards
                                                  for admission in NASD Rule 1014.



                        1. 1. 1. 5    Fees and Assessments
                                       In addition to annual dues, members pay an annual fee to FINRA based on the number of
                                   branch offices registered and the number of representatives and principals registered with the
                                   member. Firms also pay an annual assessment on their gross income from securities transac-
                                   tions, which is determined from information provided by the member’s FOCUS report.
                                       For assessment purposes, gross income can be reduced by monies paid to other members in
                                   connection with the execution and clearance of trades. Should a member fail to pay fees and
                                   assessments (including arbitration awards) on a timely basis, its membership can be revoked
                                   or suspended upon 15 days’ written notice from FINRA.

                        QUICK QUIZ 1.A            True or False?

                                                  —— 1. After being expelled by the NYSE, a firm may be granted membership in
                                                  FINRA if it files Form BD and Form U-4 for each associated person.

                                                  —— 2. A restriction agreement prohibiting certain activities of a member firm
                                                  remains effective throughout the life of the firm.

                                                  —— 3. In a membership agreement, a firm agrees to notify FINRA promptly after
                                                  merging with or acquiring another member firm.

                                                  —— 4. In the membership agreement, a firm agrees to notify FINRA within 30
                                                  business days if one of its associated persons is subject to a customer complaint
                                                  alleging theft.

                                                  —— 5. If a member firm fails to pay fees and assessments in a timely manner,
                                                  its membership may be revoked or suspended upon 15 days’ written notice from
                                                  FINRA.

                                                        Quick Quizzes found in this text are useful for locking in facts. They are not
                                                     meant to be viewed as written in the same fashion as the actual text questions.



       1. 1. 2                  REGISTRATION OF REPRESENTATIVES
                                (NASD RULE 1030)
                                     Any person associated with a FINRA member firm that intends to engage in the invest-
                                ment banking or securities business must be registered with FINRA as an associated person.
                                Anyone applying for registration with FINRA as an associated person must be sponsored by a
                                member firm and complete a questionnaire (Form U-4). A principal must verify the applicant’s
                                employment for the past three years, and investigate and attest to the character and reputation
                                of the applicant. This includes reviewing the termination Form U-5, which is discussed later.
                                If the applicant was previously registered with the National Futures Association (the futures
                                industry equivalent to FINRA), the member firm is obligated to review the NFA’s version of
                                the Form U-5, which is known as the Form 8-T.
                                     A representative is defined as any person, other than a principal, who solicits or conducts
                                business in securities for the member. Foreign associates who are noncitizens and conduct all
                                of their securities business outside the United States must be registered with FINRA but are
                                exempt from having to pass a qualification exam administered by FINRA.
                                     Note that principals, such as you, act in a supervisory role. You are the first line of defense
                                in assuring that your firm and its people are adhering to the laws, rules, and regulations of the
                                SEC, FINRA, the States, and all other applicable regulatory bodies. With that in mind, the
                                failure of any member to register an employee, who should be registered, is conduct inconsis-
                                tent with just and equitable principles of trade. When discovered, it could likely lead to severe
                                disciplinary action.
                                     Another important part of a principal’s job is to ensure that people are not only properly
                                registered but also qualified by passing the appropriate FINRA-administered examination. As
                                a principal, you have an obligation to protect the confidentiality of qualification examinations
                                and to support FINRA’s mandate to provide evidence of qualification by testing. These qualifi-
                                cation measures add confidence and serve to assure market participants that securities industry
                                professionals have the requisite knowledge to operate in an often complex and demanding job.
                                     A person returning to the office following an examination may be asked by colleagues who
                                are currently studying for the same exam, what questions were seen. Although a high-level,
                                outline discussion of general topics may be permissible, to disclose specific questions could
                                compromise the effectiveness of the examination and violate NASD Rule 1080 requiring
                                qualification examinations be held confidential. Lastly, each representative must certify to the
                                Board that no assistance was received during the examination.
                                     From time to time and in exceptional cases, FINRA may waive the examination require-
                                ment and accept instead some other standard as evidence of qualification. The request for a
                                waiver is made through the FINRA Firm Gateway. Advanced age or physical infirmity does
                                not constitute sufficient grounds for a waiver. There are a variety of avenues to approach a
                                waiver request, such as based on educational achievement, regulatory, or industry experience.
                                If a waiver is sought based on experience, FINRA considers many factors, including other
                                examinations such as those for CFP and CFA. Those exams, along with significant, substan-
                                tive experience, may be deemed sufficient for a waiver.

                                            The Series 6 license allows its holder to offer investment company products and variable
                                       contracts by prospectus. This includes mutual fund shares, unit investment trusts, and face
                                       amount certificates. It also includes closed-end investment company shares, but only during
                                       the initial public offering. In the realm of insurance products, the Series 6 representative may
                                       sell variable annuities and variable life insurance, provided the representative also holds an
                                       appropriate insurance license. To solicit or trade in stocks through NASDAQ or on the NYSE
                                       (secondary markets) requires a General Securities Representative license (Series 7).

                                            The Series 7 General Securities Representative allows the holder to offer all types of secu-

                                       for many principal level exams, such as the Series 9/10 and Series 24, as well as the Series 55.
                                       Since November 7, 2011, it is not a satisfactory prerequisite for the Series 53, which requires

                                       ary or hourly—no commissions or commission sharing. No per-transaction compensation is
                                       permitted; however, a member may pay these persons a job performance bonus.

                                     Series 55 allows the holder to trade equities, as agent or principal, OTC equity and con-
                                vertible debt securities. It is required for OTC market makers, agency, and OTC proprietary
                                traders. A Series 55 candidate must have first passed either the Series 7 or Series 62 exam. It is
                                not intended for those traders who execute orders for an investment company. Those traders
                                are in the same position as buy-side traders.
                                     A market maker is a member willing to accept the risk of holding a particular security in
                                its own account to facilitate trading in that security.

                                                         The Series 55 resulted from an SEC 21(a) report, which concluded that certain
                                                     Nasdaq market makers participated in collusive and manipulative market behavior.

       1. 1. 3                  REGISTRATION OF PRINCIPALS (NASD RULE 1020)
                                    A principal is defined as any person associated with a member who is actively engaged in
                                the management of the member’s investment banking or securities business, including supervi-
                                sion, solicitation, the conduct of business, or the training of associated persons. These persons
                                include sole proprietors, officers, partners, and managers of offices of supervisory jurisdiction.
                                    Although a member may not maintain a principal registration for anyone who is no lon-
                                ger functioning as a principal, if that person is looking to perform internal audit, back-office
                                operations, legal work, or similar jobs, the principal registration may be maintained.

                        1. 1. 3. 1         General Securities Principal—Series 24
                                           Series 24 qualifies an individual to supervise most activities of a member firm, including
                                       trading, market making, investment banking, and sales. General securities principals also may
                                       approve retail communication, including communications regarding municipal securities.


                        1. 1. 3. 2         Options Principal—Series 4
                                           Series 4 qualifies an individual to supervise the member’s options business. All mem-
                                       bers engaged in options transactions for customers must have at least one qualified, registered
                                       options principal to make sure those customers benefit from strong supervisory procedures,
                                       which, among other things, provides for the distribution of the Options Disclosure Document
                                       (ODD) published by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC).

                                           Series 26 qualifies an individual to supervise the member’s activities relating to sales of
                                       investment company products and variable products offered by insurance companies regulated

                        1. 1. 3. 4         Financial Principal—Series 27
                                            Series 27 allows the holder to supervise the preparation of the firm’s financial and opera-
                                       tional reports, such as the FOCUS Part II and related filings with the SEC and FINRA. The
                                       “FINOP” is responsible to perform the weekly reserve computation and to ascertain whether
                                       the member firm is in compliance with net capital requirements and to notify regulators when
                                       it approaches or is in violation of financial and operational rules. Lastly, the FINOP is respon-

             1. 1. 3. 6              Municipal Fund Securities Principal—Series 51
                                    Series 51 allows the holder to supervise activities in municipal fund securities, such as
                                Section 529 college savings plans and local government investment pools. A Series 51 princi-
                                pal is not permitted to supervise any other type of municipal security.


             1. 1. 3. 7              Municipal Principal—Series 53
                                  Series 53 allows the holder to supervise the purchase and sale of municipal securities. All
                                members engaged in municipal business must have at least one municipal principal.


             1. 1. 3. 8              General Securities Sales Supervisor—Series 9/10
                                     Series 9/10 allows the holder to supervise the sales efforts of a member firm. Unlike a gen-
                                eral securities principal, a Series 9/10 principal cannot oversee investment banking, trading, or
                                market making, nor can this person approve retail communications. A small non-OSJ branch
                                may have a “person-in-charge” who is physically located at and manages the people working
                                there. The person-in-charge is not required to be registered as a principal.


             1. 1. 3. 9              NYSE Supervisory Analyst—Series 16
                                    Series 16 permits an analyst for a member firm of the New York Stock Exchange to approve
                                research intended for the general investing public.


             1. 1. 3. 10 Compliance Official—Series 14
                                    The Series 14 exam is intended to ensure that the individuals designated as having day-
                                to-day compliance responsibilities for their firm or who supervise 10 or more people engaged
                                in compliance activities have the knowledge necessary to carry out the responsibilities of their
                                job. As of publication, this test is only required for those applicable compliance officers at
                                NYSE and CBOE member firms. That may change. FINRA is considering this test for compli-
                                ance officers too.
                                    Member firms are required to assign people (usually principals but not always) as FINRA’s
                                contact person for a variety of important areas of supervision. In addition to knowing who
                                exactly is the Executive Representative, the point person for AML compliance and alternate,
                                business continuity emergency contact, primary and secondary, continuing education, and
                                others need to be identified along with their contact information.
                                    Other points of contact depend on the business practice. For example, if a firm trades
                                equity and fixed-income securities, the firm would be obliged to add points of contact for those
                                lines of business. In this case, who is the head of trading and equity trading and then fixed-
                                income trading? There is the potential for a great many points of contact depending on the
                                structure and size of the member firm.
                                    NASD Rule 1160 requires firms to update contact information promptly, but in no event
                                later than 30 days following any change. Furthermore, firms must review and, if necessary,
                                update the information within 17 business days after the end of each calendar year.

                  1. 1. 4      PERSONS EXEMPT FROM REGISTRATION WITH FINRA
                               (NASD RULE 1060)
                                  Some people associated with a member firm are not required to be registered with FINRA.
                               They include the following:
                               ■■ Persons whose functions are exclusively clerical or ministerial
                               ■■ Persons who are not actively engaged in the investment banking or securities business
                               ■■ Persons whose functions relate solely to the member’s need for nominal corporate officers
                                  or for capital participation
                               ■■ Persons who effect trades on a national securities exchange, such as on the NYSE trading
                                  floor, so long as they are members of the exchange
                               ■■ Persons whose functions are solely related to commodities
                               ■■ Persons who effect transactions in security futures provided they are registered with the
                                  National Futures Association (NFA). The NFA serves a similar function to FINRA, but
                                  to the futures industry.
                               ■■ Persons who effect transactions in municipal securities. For example, a bank may be
                                  involved in the underwriting of municipal bonds, and although the bank need not register
                                  with FINRA, they are subject to regulation by banking authorities. If a bank dealer adds
                                  lines of business beyond municipal securities, such as corporate debt, that new activity
                                  would trigger the registration requirements.

                                    Ordinarily, members and associated persons do not share commissions and other allow-
                               ances with nonmembers. However, in the case of nonregistered foreign persons, they may
                               receive transaction-based compensation generated on business effected by customers whom
                               they direct to the member. This exception to the rule, however, is available only if the member
                               firm is satisfied that the finder is not required to be registered in the US and that the compen-
                               sation does not violate foreign law. In addition, the finders must be foreign nationals, and the

                                     A completed and signed Form U-4 and its Disclosure Reporting Pages (DRPs) satisfy these
                                requirements. There may be no misleading information. Those people entering the securities
                                business would be unwise to try to hide or mask those aspects of their lives that they perceive
                                might limit their chances or opportunities in a business that prizes truth and transparency.
                                Those who are found to be untruthful with regulators suffer harsh sanctions. Note that regula-
                                tors look favorably upon those who willingly amend forms prior to the discovery of an omis-
                                sion or error.
                                     The information in these files must be kept up-to-date, and every broker-dealer must keep
                                a copy of this information for a minimum of three years from the date the person ends employ-
                                ment with the firm. In addition, the copy retained by the company must have original signa-
                                tures of the initial U-4 and amendments to the DRPs. This must be made available to examin-
                                ers upon request. Social Security numbers also are collected for regulatory purposes.
                                     Broker-dealers must keep a record of each associated person with regard to whether that
                                person has passed the appropriate qualification exams. This record also must be maintained for
                                at least three years after termination of the person’s employment.
                                     To verify this information, a broker-dealer must check the person’s references and contact
                                each employer listed for the preceding three years regarding accuracy of the information given,
                                the person’s record, and reputation. A municipal broker-dealer that has been contacted by a
                                potential employer must furnish information to the new employer within 10 business days of
                                receiving the request.

                                                     U-4. However, original signatures must be obtained with the initial Form U-4 and
                                                     each submitted amendment to the DRPs found in Section 14 of the U-4.

                                    Before manually signing the form for submission to the CRD (Central Registration
                                Depository), a principal must verify the applicant’s employment for the prior three years and
                                attest to the character and reputation of the applicant.
                                    Any changes to this information require filing an amended form with the CRD not later
                                than 30 days after the member becomes aware of changes. If the amendment involved a statu-
                                tory disqualification, an amended form must be filed within 10 business days.
                                    Registration is not effective until the applicant passes the appropriate qualification
                                exam(s). If an applicant fails, 30 days must elapse before a second attempt can be made. If an
                                applicant fails a FINRA-administered exam three straight times, the person must wait 180
                                days before making a fourth or any subsequent attempt.
                                    Lastly, member firms are required under Rule 2263 to provide an associated person who
                                manually signs an initial or amended Form U-4 that the form contains a predispute binding
                                arbitration clause and cautions the associated person (AP) to read the clause before signing.
                                The AP should know that he or she is agreeing to arbitrate any dispute, claim, or controversy
                                that may arise between the firm and the AP, or a customer. Essentially, the AP is giving up the
                                right to sue a member (or another AP) or customer. Claims, however, alleging employment
                                discrimination, which included sexual harassment claims, are not required to be arbitrated
                                unless the parties agree to it. See Unit 2 for more information on dispute resolution.

                                                       Disclosure Reporting Pages. The missing information included federal and state tax
                                                       liens, three civil judgments, and two bankruptcies. He did this with 11 different firms
                                                       over the course of seven years. The National Adjudicatory Council (NAC) found that
                                                       he violated ethical standards and filed misleading information. He was suspended for
                                                       two years, required to requalify by exam, and pay assessed costs. Because his be-
                                                       havior was material and willful, he was also statutorily disqualified from the securities

                                           Before approving and affixing his/her signature on the Form U-4 for submission to the
                                       CRD, a principal must verify the applicant’s employment for the prior three years and attest to
                                       the character and reputation of the applicant.
                                           As part of the overall review of a candidate for registration with a firm, a principal may
                                       look at a person previously registered in a pre-registration search. Ordinarily, a representative
                                       must sign a written consent form authorizing the firm to perform a pre-registration search.
                                       However, when a representative submits a signed Form U-4, no other written authorization is
                                       required.

                                       PERSONNEL (SEC RULE 17F-2)
                                          SEC Rule 17f-2 requires that the following associated persons be fingerprinted:
                                       ■■ Persons applying for registration. A fingerprint card must be promptly submitted. FINRA
                                          may make a registration effective pending receipt of the fingerprint information. If finger-
                                          print information is not received within 30 days following FINRA’s receipt of Form U-4,
                                          the registration will be changed to “inactive-prints.” The individual must then cease doing
                                          business until such time as the fingerprint card is received and entered into the Web CRD.

                                     Occasionally, a firm may submit fingerprint information for a non-registered person. For

                                is part of a robust supervisory effort. Web CRD maintains fingerprint cards for non-registered
                                individuals through non-registered fingerprint (NRF) filings.
                                     If fingerprints are illegible to the FBI scanners and it rejects the fingerprint card, the mem-

                                at once.
                                     Summer interns need not be fingerprinted unless they sell securities or have access to
                                han­dling or processing securities, money, or original books and records or access to those who
                                supervise that activity.

                                obligation under FINRA by-laws to file Form U-5 with the CRD within 30 days of termination
                                date. The member firm also must provide a copy of the Form U-5 to its terminated employee
                                within the same time frame. Failure to file the form with the CRD within 30 days will result in
                                a late filing fee being assessed against the member. The form requires the member to indicate

                                     A person, who has been terminated and is no longer associated with any member, remains
                                subject to complaint filings based on conduct prior to the termination for at least two years.

                               will be placed in a specifically designated inactive status upon notification to FINRA. Because
                               these persons are inactive, they may not perform any of the duties normally performed by
                               registered representatives. However, member firms may make arrangements with another reg-
                               istered representative to have the accounts of that person serviced and to provide for a sharing
                               of the commissions such accounts generate. Furthermore, once placed in inactive status, that
                               person will not be required to complete either the regulatory or firm element of continuing
                               education.
                                    In addition, the two-year license expiration period will be tolled beginning on the date
                               the person enters active military service and will end 90 days after that person’s completion of
                               active service. If the person does not reregister with a member within 90 days after completion
                               of service, the amount of time in which the person must become reregistered with a member,
                               without being subject to the two-year expiration period, will be the standard two-year period
                               reduced by the period between the person’s termination of registration and beginning of active

                                    Registered persons must participate in continuing education (CE) programs. The CE
                               requirement has two components: (1) regulatory element, and (2) firm element.
                                    The regulatory element requires that all registered persons complete a computer-based
                               training session within 120 days after the person’s second registration anniversary and every
                               three years thereafter (i.e., within 120 days of the person’s 5th, 8th, 11th registration anni-
                               versary, et cetera). The content of the regulatory element is determined by FINRA and is
                               appropriate to either the registered representative or principal status of the person. The repre-
                               sentative’s initial registration date also is referred to as the base date.
                                    If a person fails to complete the regulatory element within the prescribed period, FINRA
                               will inactivate that person’s registration until the requirements of the program have been met.
                               An answer choice on the actual exam may point to actions, such as suspend or terminate;
                               these are not correct choices. The correct language would be the registration of the individual
                               is deemed inactive. From that point on, the representative would be prohibited from perform-
                               ing any of the duties and functions requiring registration. Anyone who remains in this inactive

                                status for two years will be terminated by FINRA and can be reregistered only after submitting
                                a new application (Form U-4) and passing the appropriate examination. As a supervisor, note
                                that members may not maintain a registration for anyone who is no longer active and is look-
                                ing only to avoid the examination requirement prescribed by NASD Rule 1030, which spells
                                out the registration requirements of FINRA.
                                    If someone can show good cause, FINRA may allow additional time to satisfy the Regulatory
                                Element beyond the two-year period. The application for the extension should not be taken
                                lightly. FINRA is unlikely to grant extensions for superficial reasons.
                                    Any registered representative who terminated association with a member and who has,
                                within two years of the date of termination, become reassociated with a member, must partici-
                                pate in the Regulatory Element based on the initial registration anniversary date rather than
                                the date of reassociation.
                                    From time to time, “In-Firm” delivery of the Regulatory Element may be permitted if the
                                firm implements a program acceptable to FINRA. Some of the requirements include, but are
                                not limited to, having a principal/officer in charge, that the location is under control of the
                                firm, that the environment be conducive to training, and that the technology be compliant
                                with FINRA standards. Furthermore, an authorized person must proctor all sessions during the
                                entire Regulatory Element session. A proctor must be present or must be able to view those
                                people sitting for Regulatory Element through a window or by video monitor.

                                    There is no requirement for a proctor to pass a qualification examination, but the proctor
                                does need to be registered. A person whose sole registration is that of proctor may not function
                                in any other area requiring registration.
                                    The principal executive officer (or executive representative) of the firm must sign a letter
                                of attestation that the in-firm delivery of the regulatory element continuing education proce-
                                dures, reasonably comply with FINRA’s requirements to deliver it.
                                    The firm element requires member firms to prepare an annual training plan that takes
                                into account such factors as recent regulatory developments, the scope of the member’s busi-
                                ness activities, the performance of its personnel in the regulatory element, and its supervisory
                                needs. This annual in-house training must be given to all registered persons who have direct
                                contact with the public.

                  2. 1         GENERAL SUPERVISION OF EMPLOYEES


                  2. 1. 1       SUPERVISION
                                    Each member is required to establish, in writing, a supervisory system to manage the types
                                of business in which it engages and the activities of its registered representatives and associ-
                                ated persons. At minimum, the member must:
                                ■■ designate appropriately registered principals with the authority to enforce the firm’s writ-
                                    ten supervisory procedures;
                                ■■ identify to FINRA which of its offices are designated as offices of supervisory jurisdiction;
                                    and
                                ■■ identify to FINRA which of its principals are responsible for reviewing the firm’s supervi-
                                    sory system and taking action where required to achieve compliance with securities laws
                                    and FINRA rules.

                                    The primary job of a supervisor of a brokerage firm is to ensure that the registered represen-
                                tatives have a good working knowledge of, and adhere to, the firm’s written supervisory proce-
                                dures. In addition, they work to assure full compliance with not only FINRA regulations but
                                also state and Federal laws, such as the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (SEA). Supervisors
                                must take all reasonable steps to prohibit the use of any manipulative and deceptive device or
                                contrivance whether the securities are nonexempt, such as IBM common stock, or exempt,
                                such as a New York City municipal bond.
                                    Some specific supervisory tasks include:
                                ■■ supervising the activities of APs;
                                ■■ ensuring all representatives are qualified by the proper examination and receive their con-
                                    tinuing education;
                                ■■ reviewing sales-related activity;
                                ■■ reviewing transactions and communications; and
                                ■■ accept new customer accounts by signature.

                                    Suitability of customer recommendations must rank high on a supervisor’s list of concerns.
                                Are recommendations reasonable and specific to that customer? That is, did the representative
                                consider the investor’s age, life stage, and liquidity needs? Can the representatives identify and
                                explain the characteristics and risks associated with the products they are offering?
                                    The following are just a few items that must be considered before reasonable recommenda-
                                tions may be made, particularly to senior investors.
                                ■■ Is the customer still employed?
                                ■■ How much longer is the customer planning to work?
                                ■■ Does the customer have a mortgage?

                                ■■ What other income sources does the customer have, if any?
                                ■■ How much income is needed to meet fixed and anticipated expenses?
                                ■■ What are the customer’s personal goals?

                                    Supervisors must always consider that firms and registered representatives are prohibited
                                from making false, exaggerated, unwarranted, or misleading statements or claims in commu-
                                nications with the public. This includes referencing nonexistent or self-conferred degrees or
                                designations.
                                    As part of any good supervisory system, the approval of materials used in seminars should
                                figure high. It’s a supervisor’s responsibility to ensure that none of the following occur:
                                ■■ Inaccurate or exaggerated claims on the safety, liquidity, or expected returns of the touted
                                    investment or strategy
                                ■■ Misrepresentations or material omissions about the investment product or strategy
                                ■■ Material omissions around conflicts of interest
                                ■■ Misrepresentations of the credentials of the seminar’s sponsor and participant
                                ■■ Failure to reference the firm’s name in advertisements
                                ■■ Improper use of testimonials in ads

                        2. 1. 1. 1     Office of Supervisory Jurisdiction (OSJ)
                                      Each member must identify to FINRA which of its offices have been designated as OSJs.
                                   An OSJ is any office at which one or more of the following functions take place:
                                   ■■ Order execution or market making
                                   ■■ Formation or structuring of public offerings or private placements
                                   ■■ Custody of customer funds or securities
                                   ■■ Final approval by a principal of new accounts on behalf of the member
                                   ■■ Review and endorsement of customer orders
                                   ■■ Final approval of retail communications, except for an office that solely conducts final
                                      approval of research reports
                                   ■■ Supervision of activities of persons at one or more of the member’s branch offices

                                       FINRA requires members to identify other offices as OSJs, if needed, to properly supervise
                                   the activities of their registered representatives. In making this determination, the member
                                   should consider:
                                   ■■ whether registered persons at a location have regular contact with the public;
                                   ■■ the number of registered persons at a location;
                                   ■■ whether the location is geographically distant from another OSJ of the firm;
                                   ■■ whether the securities activities at a location are diverse and/or complex; and
                                   ■■ whether the member’s registered persons are geographically dispersed (working remotely).

                                        The significance of an OSJ is that the office is responsible for the activities of registered
                                   representatives (and other associated persons) housed not only in that office, but in other
                                   offices usually located within the same region.
                                        The responsibilities of an OSJ, which must be managed by at least one resident general
                                   securities principal, are to:
                                   ■■ enforce the written supervisory procedures of the firm;
                                   ■■ periodically review customer accounts;
                                   ■■ maintain copies of customer records (new account forms signed by a principal, order tick-
                                        ets, confirmations, etc.), including customer complaints; and
                                   ■■ periodically inspect the branch offices beneath it.

                               EXAMPLE                  If a FINRA or an in-house auditor were to examine records maintained at an OSJ,
                                                   the auditor would be reviewing not only the activities at that location, but also the
                                                   activities of all of the non-OSJ branch office locations reporting to that OSJ.

                                       A copy of the member’s written supervisory procedures and a copy of the FINRA Manual
                                   must be kept in each OSJ and at each location where supervisory activities are conducted.
                                   Further, a copy of the Manual must be made available to customers on request. Access to the
                                   FINRA Manual electronically also will satisfy this requirement.

       2. 1. 2                  SUPERVISORY CONTROLS
                                     Member firms must designate one or more principals who will establish, maintain, and
                                enforce supervisory control procedures that will test and verify that the firm’s supervisory pro-
                                cedures are sufficient. At least once annually, the principal(s) designated must submit a report
                                to senior management that summarizes the results of testing and details any amended proce-
                                dures to be implemented.
                                     These supervisory control procedures also must be designed to review on a day-to-day basis
                                customer account activity conducted by producing branch office managers, sales managers,
                                and regional or district sales managers. A person who is senior to or otherwise independent of
                                a producing manager must perform these day-to-day supervisory reviews. Persons independent
                                from the activities being performed at that location and from the person supervising that loca-
                                tion must carry out office reviews.
                                     Remember that a member firm’s policies and procedures in supervising sales managers who
                                service accounts are expected to encompass all sales-related activities, including new account
                                approval by the principal, ongoing review of account activity in search of unauthorized trans-
                                actions, and prior approval of account name change or designation change, such as cancel and
                                rebills.
                                     A cancel and rebill transaction involves canceling a trade in one account and rebill-
                                ing it to another account. The firm’s written supervisory procedures should require a supervi-
                                sor’s approval of cancel and rebill transactions or, if done in a producing manager’s customer
                                account, the approval of some other qualified person. Failure to properly supervise cancel and
                                rebills allows registered representatives inordinate latitude, which could turn out to be disad-
                                vantageous to customers of the firm.
                                     A person who does not report to the producing manager, whose compensation is not deter-
                                mined in any way by the producing manager, and who is not in the same chain of authority
                                may be considered senior to the producing manager. This person also must have the authority
                                to correct the activities of the producing manager and take any action, including termination,
                                if and when necessary. This person must be situated in an office other than the office of the
                                producing manager. This person must alternate review responsibility with another qualified
                                person every two years or less.

                                           The designation record, which is appended to the firm’s written procedures, must be
                                       retained for six years after any change.


                  2. 1. 3              SUPERVISION OF SUPERVISORS
                                           Member firms must have procedures that are reasonably designed to provide supervision
                                       over the activities of managers.
                                           If, for example, a firm includes new and complex securities in its product line, there is
                                       likely a need for heightened supervision while managers and representatives are learning to
                                       properly offer the securities.
                                           Other examples could include a representative who has been sanctioned by FINRA for
                                       rule violations—a representative who breaches trading limits regularly or a branch manager
                                       that has a pattern of “looking the other way” when profitable but unauthorized trading is
                                       identified.
                                           Each firm must have in place sound practices and internal controls to uncover any unau-
                                       thorized practices that may undermine confidence in the firm and the industry. Sound prac-
                                       tices could include mining trade data for red flags, such as transactions in which confirmation
                                       and settlement do not occur on a timely basis. Another example could include the establish-
                                       ment of a mandatory vacation policy for supervisors and those positions, including traders,
                                       with sensitive jobs. Although not possible for some firms, those firms that have mandatory
                                       vacation policies may look at the request of the trader or representative for an exemption from
                                       the policy as a red flag. During the vacation, supervising managers may look through the files
                                       and records of the vacationer to identify irregularities or attempts to conceal unauthorized
                                       activity such as “rogue” trading.

                                                           A firm’s procedures must prohibit supervisory personnel from supervising their
                                                       own activities or having their compensation or continued employment determined by
                                                       a person they are supervising.
                                                            If the firm’s size or a supervisory personnel’s position within the firm makes com-
                                                       pliance with these restrictions impracticable, the member firm is obligated to docu-
                                                       ment the factors the firm used to make that determination and how supervision with
                                                       respect to supervisory personnel otherwise complies with the rule. This situation might
                                                       arise in instances where the broker-dealer is a sole proprietorship.

                                           A member firm’s supervisory control policies and procedures must include specific review
                                       of the following activities:
                                       ■■ All transmittal of funds or securities from customer accounts
                                           —— that would result in a change of beneficial ownership;
                                           —— to outside entities, such as banks or investment companies;
                                           —— to locations other than a customer’s primary residence; and
                                          —— to registered representatives, including the hand delivery of checks
                                       ■■ Customer changes of address and the validation of such change

       2. 1. 5                  INTERNAL INSPECTIONS
                                    FINRA Rule 3110 requires, among other things, that OSJs and the lines of business in
                                which it engages be inspected and reviewed annually. Branches that supervise one or more
                                nonbranch locations also must be inspected annually. Branches that do not supervise other
                                locations must be inspected at least once every three years. Nonbranches must be inspected
                                according to a schedule determined by the firm. Records relating to inspections must be kept
                                for at least three years. Those locations that do nothing other than approve research reports
                                are exempt from definition of an OSJ.

                                                           Although not strictly prohibited, there is a general presumption that a principal
                                                      will not be designated to be the on-site principal for more than one OSJ. However,
                                                      if the firm deems it necessary, it may do so but must consider all of the other factors
                                                      including, among other things, whether the on-site principal has the time to supervise
                                                      the activities at the other locations.

                                CERTAIN FIRMS (FINRA RULE 3170)
                                     If a member hires representatives who were previously associated with a disciplined firm,
                                the member may be required to establish procedures for monitoring the telemarketing activi-
                                ties of all of its registered persons. A disciplined firm is one that has been expelled from mem-
                                bership in any SRO or is the subject of an SEC order revoking its registration as a broker-dealer.
                                     The criteria used by FINRA are as follows.
                                                                                                 Number of Registered

                                                      prior three years, were associated with a disciplined firm, the member is required to
                                                      monitor the phone calls of all of its registered persons. The member must record and
                                                      review all phone conversations of its representatives with clients, existing and poten-
                                                      tial (cold calls).

                                    Once the member is advised by FINRA that special supervisory procedures are required,
                                the firm has 60 days to implement them by tape recording all telephone conversations between
                                the registered persons and both existing and potential customers.
                                    These special supervisory procedures must be maintained for three years. In addition, the
                                member must provide FINRA with quarterly reports on its telemarketing supervision. All
                                recordings made, as well as the quarterly reports, must be maintained for three years.

                                       ■■ The primary residence of an associated person (to be exempt, the associated person may

                                       ■■ Any location, other than a primary residence, that is used for less than 30 business days
                                           annually for securities business (these locations would generally include vacation or sec-

                                           deemed “holding out” as a branch office under Rule 3110
                                       ■■ Any location used primarily for nonsecurities business (e.g., insurance sales) and from
                                           which less than 25 securities transactions are effected annually

            TEST TOPIC ALERT
                            !                              FINRA rules require that there be at least one principal at an OSJ. FINRA rules do
                                                      not require principals to be at branch offices. A properly qualified registered represen-
                                                      tative can act as branch manager. However, the location must be under the supervi-
                                                      sion of an OSJ.

                                    In addition to each firm being required to designate and specifically identify to FINRA one
                                or more principals who must establish, maintain, and enforce a system of supervisory control
                                policies and procedures, those appointed must test and verify that the procedures are, in fact,
                                reasonably designed to achieve compliance. If it turns out following testing and verification
                                there is a need to create additional or amend supervisory procedures, those principals are obli-
                                gated to make sure that happens.
                                    The designated principals must submit to the member’s senior management annually a
                                report detailing the system of supervisory controls, the summary of the test results and signifi-
                                cant identified exceptions, and any additional or amended supervisory procedures created in
                                response to a test.
                                    Each report provided to senior management in the calendar year following a calendar year
                                in which a member reported $200 million or more in gross revenue must include, when appli-
                                cable to the member’s business, a tabulation of the reports pertaining to customer complaints
                                and internal investigations made to FINRA during the preceding year and discussion of the
                                preceding year’s compliance efforts, including procedures and educational programs, in each
                                of the following areas:
                                ■■ trading and market activities;
                                ■■ investment banking activities;
                                ■■ anti-fraud and sales practices;
                                ■■ finance and operations;
                                ■■ supervision; and
                                ■■ anti-money laundering.


       2. 1. 8                  ANNUAL COMPLIANCE MEETING
                                     FINRA rules require that all registered representatives (Series 6, 52, 7 and so forth) and
                                registered principals participate, at least once each year, in a meeting or interview at which
                                compliance matters relevant to the activities of the particular representative and principal are
                                discussed. These meetings can be held individually or with a group and typically take place at
                                a central location or at the representative’s or principal’s place of business. They may, however,
                                be conducted by video conference, telephone, interactive classroom setting, or other elec-
                                tronic means so long as certain safeguards are in place to assure full participation. For example,
                                if the firm conducts the meeting via a webcast, the registered person would be issued a user
                                ID and password to access the presentation with a click-as-you-go confirmation. Although
                                FINRA does not require any specific method, whichever method the firm uses, it must be rea-
                                sonably reliable at demonstrating compliance.

                  2. 1. 9              INDEPENDENT REVIEW
                                           FINRA requires that a member designate one or more principals who will establish, main-
                                       tain, and enforce supervisory control procedures that will test and verify that the firm’s supervi-
                                       sory procedures are sufficient. At least once annually, the principal(s) designated must submit
                                       a report to senior management that summarizes the results of testing and details any amended
                                       procedures and controls to be implemented, including the CEO certification.
                                           Firms must have procedures to prohibit supervisory personnel from supervising their own
                                       activities and reporting to (or having compensation or employment determined by) the per-
                                       son whom the supervisor is supervising. Office reviews must be carried out by persons inde-
                                       pendent from the activities being performed at that location and from the person supervising
                                       that location.

                                                            The SEC deems exchanges, SROs, and member firms to be “gatekeepers” of
                                                       securities laws. If, for example, a customer somehow gained a head start on valuable
                                                       trading information, an exchange that could have prevented the violation but did not
                                                       have sufficiently robust processes in place to prevent it could be disciplined along with
                                                       the offending customer.
                                                            Supervisory personnel at a broker-dealer who fail to prevent securities laws viola-
                                                       tions by customers when they saw or should have seen the violative conduct may be
                                                       held to account for failing to live up to their gatekeeper responsibilities.

                                           Please take the time to carefully review the following supervisory requirements that prin-
                                       cipals should consider when creating a strong supervisory system. This is more than a mere list.
                                       As you go through this, you will be creating and strengthening your ability to build a culture
                                       of compliance.
                                       ■■ Supervision of Multiple OSJs by a Single Principal—FINRA member firms are required
                                           to maintain at least one onsite principal with supervisory responsibilities, and a regular
                                           and routine physical presence, at each office of supervisory jurisdiction (OSJ). The rules
                                           contain a presumption that a principal will not be designated and assigned to be an onsite
                                           principal to supervise more than one OSJ. The presumption may be overcome if a member
                                           considers and documents its consideration of certain factors, such as the experience of the
                                           principal and the geographic proximity of each OSJ the principal will be supervising.
                                       ■■ Internal Office Inspections—Inspections of non-branch offices are required, and there is
                                           a presumption that a non-branch office will be inspected at least every three years. Addi-
                                           tionally, other than compliance personnel, the rules prohibit an AP from inspecting the
                                           AP’s office.
                                       ■■ Restrictions on Supervisory Personnel—Firms must have procedures to prohibit supervi-
                                           sory personnel from supervising their own activities and reporting to (or having compen-
                                           sation or employment determined by) the person whom the supervisor is supervising.
                                       ■■ Risk-Based Reviews of Transactions—Firms may employ a “risk-based” review of transac-
                                           tions. Firms are not required to conduct a detailed review of each transaction and may
                                           prioritize for review certain transactions that pose a greater risk of potential violations of
                                           securities laws and rules.
                                       ■■ Risk-Based Reviews of Correspondence and Communication—Similarly, with regard to
                                           the requirement to review all written (including electronic) correspondence and internal
                                           communication relating to a firm’s investment banking and securities, business firms may
                                           use risk-based principles for its review of communications.

                                ■■ Internal Supervisory Reports—In addition to the requirement that a member firm must
                                   submit an annual report to senior management summarizing the testing and verification
                                   of its supervisory procedures, FINRA Rule 3120 requires that a member with $200 million
                                   or more in gross revenue must include additional content in the annual report submitted,
                                   including information related to customer complaints, internal investigations, and the
                                   firm’s compliance efforts.
                                ■■ Customer Complaints—A member firm’s supervisory procedures must include procedures
                                   to capture, acknowledge, and respond to all written (including electronic) customer com-
                                   plaints. Although oral customer complaints are not touched per se by the rules, FINRA
                                   encourages firms to provide customers with a standardized form so that they could easily
                                   communicate their complaints in writing. Firms that fail to address any customer com-
                                   plaint, whether written or oral, may violate the “high standards” rule.
                                ■■ Review of Securities Transactions for Insider Trading—Member firms are required to have
                                   supervisory procedures to review securities transactions effected for a member’s or its asso-
                                   ciated persons’ accounts in order to identify insider trading and manipulative and decep-
                                   tive devices. This rule means that member firms must now implement processes designed
                                   to identify insider trading and manipulative practices for certain securities transactions.
                                ■■ Internal Investigations of Securities Transactions for Insider Trading—Related to the
                                   previous, in addition to reviewing certain securities transactions for insider trading and
                                   manipulation, firms must also conduct a prompt internal investigation into any such trade
                                   to determine whether a violation of the laws prohibiting insider trading and manipulative
                                   devices has occurred.
                                ■■ Written Reports for Firms Engaging in Investment Banking Services—Investment bank-
                                   ing firms must file written reports with FINRA in connection with the internal investiga-
                                   tions previously discussed. The written reports must be signed by a senior officer of the
                                   member firm and must provide details about the results of the internal investigation and
                                   any disciplinary action taken to correct the prohibited insider trading or manipulative
                                   conduct.


       2. 1. 10 NETWORKING ARRANGEMENTS (FINRA RULE 3160)
                                    It is not unusual for a broker-dealer and a financial institution such as a federal or state-
                                charted bank, savings bank, or a credit union to have a networking arrangement, that is, a
                                contract under which the member firm offers its services on (or off) the premises of the bank.
                                That is an acceptable, well-accepted practice. However, there are certain steps that have to
                                be taken to protect investors from inferring that securities and services being offered have the
                                same safeguards and protections afforded to bank accounts.
                                    A member that conducts broker-dealer services on the premises of a bank must clearly be
                                identified. In other words, steps must be taken to distinguish broker-dealer services from that
                                of services provided by the financial institution, such as in an area that clearly displays the
                                member’s name, and to the extent practicable, a location physically separate from the routine
                                retail deposit-taking activities of the bank.
                                    The bank must unambiguously know and the agreement must clearly state in writing that
                                the member firm’s supervisory personnel and representatives of the SEC and FINRA will be
                                permitted access to the bank’s premises in order to inspect the books and records.
                                    Customers must be made aware in writing at or prior to the time that a customer account
                                is opened that the broker-dealer’s services are not being provided by the financial institution




Series_24_9e_Rev_LEM.indb 48                                                                                                        5/27/2015 7:38:09 AM

                                but rather the member firm. Furthermore, customers must be made aware that the securities

                  2. 2. 1       RECOMMENDATIONS TO NONINSTITUTIONAL
                                ACCOUNTS
                                    Before recommending a security transaction for a noninstitutional customer (retail
                                account), registered representatives must have reasonable grounds for believing that the rec-
                                ommendation is suitable in light of the customer’s:
                                ■■ financial situation, including income and net worth;
                                ■■ tax status;
                                ■■ investment objectives;
                                ■■ risk tolerance; and
                                ■■ other holdings.

                                    The key is suitability. Implicit in all dealings with customers is the responsibility for fair
                                dealing. Sales efforts, including recommendations, must be judged on the basis of whether
                                they represent fair and ethical treatment for the customer to whom the recommendation is
                                being made.
                                    For example, a member (or AP) may not recommend that a customer buy or sell short any
                                OTC equity security (non-NMS) unless the member has reviewed the issuer’s current finan-

                                circumstances for making the recommendation.

                 CASE STUDY                           Fraudulent Sale of Securities Situation:

                                                            Mr. Luu, the registered sales agent, knowingly omitted the fact that analysts of
                                                      the broker-dealer recently joined other firms in downgrading their assessment of the
                                                      company and that the company bonds were placed on a credit watch by one of the
                                                      major credit rating agencies prior to selling a large number of shares to Mr. Chong. A
                                                      month after the sale, the shares became worthless.
                                                            Analysis: Mr. Luu sold these securities to Mr. Chong in violation of the law
                                                      because he deliberately or knowingly failed to mention material infomation—informa-
                                                      tion that was important for Mr. Chong to know in order for him to make an informed
                                                      investment decision. It was found that Mr. Chong has the right to recover the finan-
                                                      cial losses that resulted from the sale.

                                     When a representative changes firms, a major interest of the new firm is obtaining the
                                representative’s book of business. A number of customers serviced may own mutual funds that
                                the prior firm was authorized to sell pursuant to a dealer agreement. However, there may be
                                impediments to the representative’s ability to continue servicing or selling these investments
                                as well as receiving trailer commissions. For example, the issuer may hold the product or it may
                                be proprietary to the prior firm. Even with non-proprietary products, the new firm might not
                                have a dealer agreement with the sponsor.
                                     In these situations, the transferring representative might be tempted to recommend to
                                customers that they replace their existing funds with other investments without considering
                                the suitability of these recommendations. In making a recommendation to liquidate an exist-
                                ing fund, a firm may consider that it lacks a dealer agreement with the sponsor and, therefore,
                                cannot provide the customer with the service expected.
                                     To deal with these situations, a firm must have procedures in place that include the
                                following:
                                ■■ When conducting due diligence concerning a prospective new representative, the new
                                     firm should learn the nature of the representative’s business and the extent to which the
                                     representative sells products for which the new firm would need a dealer agreement. The
                                     new firm should determine whether it would seek such agreements.
                                ■■ If the new firm is unable or unwilling to service a customer’s mutual fund, the new firm or
                                     the representative should advise the customer of this as well as the option to continue to
                                     hold the fund at the prior firm before recommending that the customer liquidate or sur-
                                     render the investment.
                                ■■ For a reasonable time period following the hiring of the new representative, the firm should
                                     review the replacements recommended by the new representative with a view to identify
                                     any recommendations to liquidate that may not be suitable.

                  2. 2. 2          RECOMMENDATIONS TO INSTITUTIONAL ACCOUNTS
                                       With respect to institutional customers, a member can fulfill its suitability obligations by
                                   focusing on the:
                                   ■■ institution’s capability to independently evaluate investment risk; and
                                   ■■ extent to which the institution makes independent investment decisions.

                                       When a member has reasonable grounds for concluding that the institution is making
                                   independent investment decisions (i.e., not depending on the member or others) and is capa-
                                   ble of independently evaluating risk, the member’s suitability obligation is fulfilled. In other
                                   words, the member can make virtually any recommendation, because the institution is sophis-
                                   ticated enough to know which recommendations make sense and which should be rejected.

                                    (NASD RULE 3040)
                                       A private securities transaction is any securities transaction executed outside the scope of
                                   an associated person’s employment with a member firm. When done without the firm’s knowl-
                                   edge and approval, it is known as “selling away” a serious violation.




                               *
                               EXAMPLE                 Unbeknownst to a member firm, one of its registered representatives, during the
                                                   evening and weekends, helped a friend market a private placement of unregistered
                                                   securities. In this case, the registered representative acted without knowledge and
                                                   approval of the firm. This would likely lead to strong disciplinary procedures by the
                                                   employer and may include severe sanctions from FINRA.

                                      Before participating in a private securities transaction, a registered representative (or any
                                   other associated person) must:
                                   ■■ provide written notice to the member describing in detail the proposed transaction, the
                                      person’s role, and compensation to be received; and
                                   ■■ if no compensation, the member must provide the AP prompt written acknowledgment of
                                      the notice and may require the person to accept certain conditions placed upon his or her
                                      participation in the transaction.

                                       If the member does approve in writing (such as a rep selling variable-like insurance outside
                                   the firm), the member must record the transaction on its books and records. Practically speak-
                                   ing, the member must supervise the person’s participation as if the transaction were its own. If
                                   a member disapproves in writing, the person’s participation is prohibited.
                                       There is one circumstance in which no written notification and response is required: if the
                                   proposed private securities transaction is for the benefit of an immediate family member and
                                   the associated person is to receive no compensation, the notification requirements are waived.

                                reasonably expects to be compensated by any entity other than from the member (bartender,
                                wedding photographer, tax preparer, etc.), that person must provide written notice to the
                                member. Following notification by the associated person, the member must be satisfied that
                                the activity will not compromise the registered person’s responsibilities to the firm or its cus-
                                tomers or be viewed by customers as part of the member’s business.
                                     Following an evaluation of the proposed outside business activity, the member may impose
                                conditions or place limitations on the representative’s outside business activity. The member
                                may, if warranted, prohibit the activity. A member also must evaluate and determine whether
                                the activity should be handled as a private securities transaction and, therefore, be subject to
                                NASD Rule 3040.
                                     The firm must retain a record of each written notice received and must preserve this record
                                for three years.

                                                           FINRA concluded that the registered representative violated FINRA Rule 3270

                                                      suspended the representative for two years.

                  2. 2. 5          MEMBER ACTING IN A FIDUCIARY CAPACITY
                                        When acting as a fiduciary on behalf of an issuer of securities, member firms may be given
                                   a list of shareholders.
                                        Under FINRA rules, a shareholder list can only be used as directed by the issuer (e.g., to
                                   solicit proxies). It can be used for no other purpose.




                               *
                               EXAMPLE                    In situations in which a member is asked by an issuer to solicit proxies on its be-
                                                   half, the member will be given a list of the issuer’s shareholders for contact purposes.
                                                   It would be tempting, but it is a violation of the member’s fiduciary responsibility to
                                                   the issuer to use this list for cold calling purposes, knowing that every person on the
                                                   list is a buyer of common stock.



                  2. 2. 6          INFLUENCING OR REWARDING EMPLOYEES OF
                                   OTHERS (FINRA RULE 3220)
                                        No member firm or AP may give or permit to be given anything of value, including gratu-
                                   ities, in excess of $100 per individual per year to any employee of another person where the
                                   payment (gratuity) is related to the business of the employer of the recipient. A gift of any kind
                                   is considered a gratuity.
                                        Rule 3220, however, does not preclude ordinary and usual business entertainment allot-
                                   ted to the member’s clients and their guests so long as it is occasional and not so frequent or
                                   extensive as to raise any question of propriety. There is an expectation that the AP would
                                   attend the event. Otherwise, the giving of tickets, for instance, would not be permitted if over
                                   $100. Note, however, that if sporting or theater tickets have been obtained with the view to
                                   attend and then the representative receives word that an accident or some other unfortunate
                                   event came up requiring the AP to abandon his entertainment plans, his guests could still use
                                   the tickets without it becoming a regulatory issue. Recordkeeping requirements are such that
                                   a pattern of abuse would be quick and easy to spot by supervisors, compliance officials, and
                                   FINRA examiners.
                                        The prohibitions in Rule 3220 also do not apply to personal gifts (e.g., wedding, bereave-
                                   ment, or sympathy gifts) or to promotional items of de minimis value, such as pens or modest
                                   desk ornaments displaying the firm’s logo. Furthermore, FINRA does not apply this rule to
                                   Lucite tombstones or plaques given to commemorate business transactions, such as an under-
                                   writing, even when the cost of such items may well exceed $100.
                                        Members are required to have systems and procedures in place to ensure that gifts given in
                                   relation to the business of the member are reported to the firm, are reviewed for compliance
                                   with the rule, and are maintained in the firm’s records.
                                        A special case arises when, for example, a trader for a pension or mutual fund solicits sub-
                                   stantial charitable contributions from members with whom they conduct business. Member
                                   firms must act carefully and establish written procedures concerning their charitable giving,
                                   which may give rise to a conflict of interest. For example, the WSPs could require approval for
                                   charitable contributions that exceed a specific dollar threshold or frequency.
                                        Any dollar thresholds should take into account the nature of the firm’s business and its
                                   customary practice of charitable giving. This next point is key. Under no circumstances should
                                   the threshold for charitable contributions be based upon the level of business done or antici-
                                   pated by the customer soliciting charitable contributions.

                                                           Gifts given by a member to its employees are not covered by this rule.


             2. 2. 6. 1               Contracts
                                    The limitations of FINRA Rule 3220 do not apply to contracts of employment in which
                                compensation is paid. For instance, a member could hire, on a temporary basis, administrative
                                employees of another member firm as long as a written agreement that describes the nature of
                                the employment and the compensation arrangement is in place between the member firm and
                                the persons to be employed.
                                    The written consent of each person’s employing firm also is required. Permission of FINRA
                                to enter into contracts with employees of another member is not required. Records of these
                                contracts, as well as of gifts made or received, must be retained for three years.


             2. 2. 6. 2               Media
                                     Similarly, FINRA prohibits member firms from giving anything of value to any person to
                                influence the publication in any media of information intended to affect the market price of
                                any security.


             2. 2. 6. 3               Noncash Compensation
                                     FINRA is concerned about the potential conflicts of interest created when program spon-
                                sors, such as investment companies, provide incentives or rewards to representatives for selling
                                the sponsor’s products. These incentives are in the form of noncash compensation, which is
                                subject to the following rules: an occasional meal or a ticket to a sporting event or the theatre
                                is acceptable as long as it is not conditioned on the achievement of a sales target. Payment or
                                reimbursement by sponsors in connection with meetings held to train or educate representa-
                                tives is acceptable as long as:
                                ■■ the representative obtains the member’s prior permission to attend;
                                ■■ the location of the meeting is appropriate to the purpose of the meeting (e.g., an office of
                                     the sponsor or the member would be appropriate; a meeting held at the Atlantis Hotel in
                                     the Bahamas is not);
                                ■■ there is no payment or reimbursement for a guest (e.g., a spouse) of the representative
                                     attending the meeting;
                                ■■ payment or reimbursement is not conditioned on the achievement of a sales target;
                                ■■ there is no payment or reimbursement for certain expenses incurred in connection with
                                     meetings, such as golf outings, cruises, tours, and similar types of entertainment; and
                                ■■ the member firm creates a record of all noncash compensation received by its representa-

                  2. 2. 7              BORROWING FROM OR LENDING TO CUSTOMERS
                                       (FINRA RULE 3240)
                                           No one registered with a FINRA member firm may borrow or lend money to a customer
                                       unless the firm has written procedures allowing such arrangements. If permitted by the firm,
                                       the lending arrangement must fall within one of the following permissible types:
                                       ■■ The customer is a member of the representative’s immediate family
                                       ■■ The customer is in the business of lending money (e.g., a bank)
                                       ■■ The customer and the representative are both registered with the same firm
                                       ■■ The lending arrangement is based on a personal relationship outside of the broker-cus-
                                           tomer relationship
                                       ■■ The lending arrangement is based on a business relationship outside of the broker-cus-
                                           tomer relationship

                                           With the exception of the first two listed, registered persons who wish to borrow from or
                                       lend to customers are required to provide the firm with written notice and receive approval in
                                       writing. Members are required to preserve the written preapproval for at least three years after
                                       the date the borrowing or lending arrangement terminated, or for at least three years after the
                                       representative’s termination.

                               CASE STUDY              For Example: Borrowing Money or Securities from Clients

                                                             Situation: On occasion, Mr. Thompson borrowed cash from his discretionary cli-
                                                       ent, Mr. Bixby, when Mr. Bixby’s account was not fully invested. Mr. Bixby gave Mr.
                                                       Thompson wide latitude, because Mr. Thompson managed the account well, and Mr.
                                                       Thompson always repaid the money in time to reinvest Mr. Bixby’s funds in new secu-
                                                       rities purchases. Mr. Thompson justified these borrowings as within the discretionary
                                                       power Mr. Bixby granted him. The First National Bank also is a client of Mr. Thomp-
                                                       son, but he did not borrow from the bank, because of unusually high interest rates.
                                                             Analysis: Mr. Thompson engaged in a prohibited practice, because securities
                                                       professionals may not borrow from customers who are not in the business of lending
                                                       money. Furthermore, Mr. Thompson violated the law in exceeding the specific discre-
                                                       tionary authority that Mr. Bixby had authorized. Mr. Bixby authorized Mr. Thompson
                                                       to trade in securities—not to take his money for personal use. Had Mr. Thompson
                                                       decided to borrow from The First National Bank, it would have been permitted,
                                                       because it is an entity engaged in the business of lending money.

       2. 2. 8                  CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS
                                    A complaint is defined as a written (including electronic) statement by a customer (or a
                                person acting on behalf of a customer) alleging a grievance arising out of, or in connection
                                with, a securities transaction.
                                    If a complaint is resolved to the satisfaction of both the member firm and the customer, no
                                further action is needed.
                                    If it cannot be resolved, it must be referred to the director of arbitration of FINRA (dis-
                                cussed later in this Unit). If the complaint involves allegations of theft, misappropriation of
                                funds or securities, or forgery, the member must promptly (not later than 30 days) report this
                                to FINRA.


             2. 2. 8. 1               Recordkeeping of Complaints
                                    FINRA Rule 4513 states that copies of all customer complaints be maintained in a file
                                at the supervising OSJ. However, the rule does permit a member to keep a complaint file at
                                the office where a complaint originated, if it chooses, rather than keeping them all at the
                                OSJ. Each complaint in the file must be accompanied by a statement of its resolution and be
                                endorsed by a principal. Member firms must electronically file information on all customer
                                complaints with FINRA. These filings must be made within 15 days of the end of each calen-
                                dar quarter.

                            !                              Copies of customer complaints, as well as the quarterly filings, must be retained
                                                      for four years.



       2. 2. 9                    TRANSACTIONS FOR ASSOCIATED PERSONS
                                  (NASD RULE 3050)
                                     A member firm that knowingly executes a securities transaction for the account of a rep-
                                resentative of another member firm (employer member), or for any account over which the
                                representative has discretionary authority (limited power of attorney), must use reasonable
                                diligence to determine that the trade will not adversely affect the interests of the employer
                                member firm.
                                     The executing member, at a minimum, must notify the employer member in writing, prior
                                to the execution of a transaction in that type of account of the executing member’s intention
                                to open or accept it.
                                     Furthermore, upon written request by the employer member, the executing firm must send
                                copies of confirmations, statements, or any other information with respect to the account and
                                notify the representative of the executing member’s intention to provide the notice and infor-
                                mation to the employer member.

                                                      the account. The notifications under this rule also are applicable to the opening of
                                                      any account over which an associated person of another member has discretionary

                                           If the executing member opens the account, it is required to use reasonable diligence to
                                       determine that trades in the account will not adversely affect the interests of the employer
                                       member. A member does this by making sure the employer member, requested or not, receives
                                       duplicate statements. If the employer member requests confirmations in writing, then the
                                       executing member must forward them.
                                           The rule places obligations on the associated person as well. Before opening an account
                                       with another member, an associated person must notify both the employer member and
                                       executing member, in writing, of his association with the other member. If the account was
                                       opened before association with a member, the associated person must notify both members
                                       promptly in writing.
                                           A representative who wishes to open a securities account at a nonmember institution (e.g.,
                                       a bank or investment adviser) must notify her employer member in writing of the intention to
                                       open the account. Upon the written request by the employer member, the associated person
                                       must advise the nonmember institution to send duplicate statements and confirmations.
                                           There is one exception to the notification rule: if an associated person wants to open an
                                       account with another member and limits transactions in the account to unit trusts, variable
                                       contacts, or mutual funds, no notification is required.


                  2. 2. 10 PROHIBITIONS AGAINST SHARING IN CUSTOMER
                           ACCOUNTS AND GUARANTEES AGAINST LOSS (FINRA
                           RULE 2150)
                                           As a rule, associated persons are not permitted to share in the profit and loss in customer
                                       accounts unless the associated person:
                                           (i) obtains prior written authorization from the member employing the associated person;
                                           (ii) obtains prior written authorization from the customer; and
                                           (iii) shares in the profits or losses in any account of such customer only in direct propor-
                                       tion to the financial contributions made to such account by either the member or person
                                       associated with a member.
                                           It is unlikely that a principal would approve such a sharing agreement, as it would be vir-
                                       tually impossible to monitor the proportionate test. However, if there is an immediate family
                                       relationship between the customer and the associated person, the proportionate test does not
                                       apply.
                                           A member or associated person can never guarantee a customer against loss, in writing or
                                       otherwise. Members can, however, recommend the purchase of puts to hedge long stock posi-
                                       tions or the purchase of calls to hedge short stock positions in order to limit losses.
                                           Members are prohibited, however, from using repurchase agreements in connection with
                                       nonexempt securities. A repurchase agreement is a loan made by the customer to a member
                                       firm, collateralized by an equal value of securities. The member, on or before an agreed-upon
                                       date, will repurchase the securities from the customer at a fixed (higher) price.
                                           The difference is the interest earned by the customer. Repurchase agreements are only
                                       permitted in cases in which the underlying securities are exempt securities, such as U.S. gov-
                                       ernment or municipal bonds.

       2. 2. 12 PROCEDURES FOR EXEMPTIONS
                                    A member firm seeking an exemption from any of the Member Conduct Rules must file a
                                written application with FINRA stating the rule or rules from which the member is seeking an
                                exemption and a detailed statement of the grounds for requesting an exemption.
                                    After consideration, FINRA will issue a written decision of its conclusions. If the mem-
                                ber receives an adverse decision, the member, within 15 days, may appeal the decision to the
                                National Adjudicatory Council (NAC). The NAC will then affirm, modify, or reverse the
                                decision. At that point, the matter is closed.



       2. 3             PROCEDURAL RULES


       2. 3. 1                  INVESTIGATIONS
                                    In connection with any investigation, complaint, or examination, FINRA and/or the SEC
                                can require a member firm or any person associated with a member to:
                                ■■ provide information orally, in writing, or electronically;
                                ■■ give testimony on the record and under oath; and
                                ■■ provide access to, or copies of, any books, records, or accounts (make certain anything
                                    provided to examiners is encrypted).

                                    If a member or associated person fails to comply, the National Adjudicatory Council
                                (NAC), after providing 20 days’ written notice, has the right to suspend the member and
                                revoke the registration of any associated person.
                                    The NAC is responsible for the development of regulatory and enforcement policy and
                                rule changes relating to the business and sales practices of member firms. It also is responsible
                                for the oversight of the Department of Enforcement, which has the authority to file com-
                                plaints against member firms and their associated persons.

                  2. 3. 2              CODE OF PROCEDURE
                                           The Code of Procedure was created to address alleged violations of FINRA rules, MSRB
                                       rules, and federal securities laws. If, after an investigation or firm examination, FINRA believes
                                       cause of action exists, in that a member and/or its associated persons may have violated one or
                                       more rules or laws, the Department of Enforcement will issue a formal complaint. With the fil-
                                       ing of a complaint, the department will name a hearing officer to preside over the disciplinary
                                       proceeding (hearing) and also will appoint panelists to serve as a jury. All panelists in Code of
                                       Procedure hearings are from the industry.
                                           The respondent has 25 days after receiving the complaint to respond to the hearing panel.
                                       Answers must specifically admit, deny, or state that the respondent does not have sufficient
                                       information to admit or deny. If the respondent does not answer within 25 days, the depart-
                                       ment will send a second notice requiring an answer within 14 days of receipt. This notice states
                                       that failure to reply allows the hearing officer to enter a default decision (guilty as charged).
                                           If additional facts come to light that cause the Department to file an amended com-
                                       plaint, the time for filing an answer or amended answer is 14 days after receipt of the amended
                                       complaint.

                        2. 3. 2. 2         Uncontested Offer
                                           By submitting an offer of settlement, the respondent waives the right to a hearing and the
                                       right to appeal. If the offer is accepted by the Department of Enforcement, it is then sent to
                                       the NAC for review. If uncontested by the NAC, the offer is accepted and final.


                        2. 3. 2. 3         Contested Offer
                                           If the Department of Enforcement opposes the offer, the offer is contested. At this point,
                                       the offer and the department’s written opposition are submitted to the hearing panel. The
                                       panel may order a settlement conference between the parties in an attempt to work out a
                                       compromise or may forward the offer and the department’s opposition to the NAC.

                                   If the NAC rejects the offer (or compromise offer), the hearings begin. If accepted by the
                                NAC, the offer (or compromise offer) is final. If an offer of settlement is ultimately rejected, it
                                may not be introduced as evidence at the hearing.


             2. 3. 2. 4               Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent (AWC)
                                    If the respondent does not dispute the allegations, the Department of Enforcement may
                                prepare and request that the respondent sign a letter accepting a finding of violation, consent-
                                ing to the imposition of sanctions, and waiving the right to a hearing and the right to appeal.
                                    If agreed to by the respondent, the letter is sent to the NAC and, if approved, becomes
                                final. If opposed by the NAC, the next step is formal hearings. In actuality, if the Department
                                of Enforcement felt there was a chance of opposition from the NAC, it would not have offered
                                AWC in the first place.


             2. 3. 2. 5               Minor Rule Violation (MRV)
                                    If the complaint involves a minor violation and the respondent does not dispute the alle-
                                gation, the Department of Enforcement may prepare and request that the respondent sign an
                                MRV letter, accepting a finding of violation. An example of a minor rule violation would be
                                the failure to file an amendment to Form U-5 on a timely basis.
                                    Once the respondent signs an MRV letter, the settlement is final. The NAC, as a sanction,
                                may impose a fine not to exceed $2,500.


             2. 3. 2. 6               Prehearing Conference
                                    Assuming the respondent does not make an offer of settlement (or, if made, it is rejected),
                                and assuming the Department of Enforcement does not offer AWC or MRV as options, a pre-
                                hearing conference is scheduled. Under Code of Procedure rules, it must be held within 21
                                days of receipt of the respondent’s answer to the complaint.
                                    This conference addresses matters such as:
                                ■■ simplification and clarification of the issues;
                                ■■ witness lists and exhibit lists;
                                ■■ criteria for including and excluding certain evidence; and
                                ■■ the determination of a hearing date.

                                   At the conference, parties to the dispute are warned that contemptuous or frivolous con-
                                duct by any person (including attorneys) will result in sanctions imposed by the NAC.


             2. 3. 2. 7               Hearing
                                    At the hearing, which resembles a courtroom proceeding, the hearing panel (Department
                                of Enforcement) goes first, calling witnesses, producing documents, and so forth. Cross-
                                examination of witnesses is permitted. At the conclusion, panelists convene and, within 60
                                days, render a written decision reflecting the majority view.

                                                            In extraordinary circumstances, a hearing panel has the authority to issue both
                                                        a temporary cease and desist order and a permanent cease and desist order. This will
                                                        happen only if there is an extreme threat to the investing public.


                        2. 3. 2. 8         Sanctions
                                           Sanctions against a member or associated person found in violation of securities laws
                                       and rules are included with the written decision. Under Code of Procedure, sanctions could
                                       include one or more of the following:
                                       ■■ Censure
                                       ■■ Fine
                                       ■■ Suspension of the membership of a member or suspension of the registration of an associ-
                                           ated person for up to two years
                                       ■■ Expulsion of the member, cancellation of the membership of the member, or revocation or
                                           cancellation of the registration of an associated person
                                       ■■ Barring a member or associated person from association with all members
                                       ■■ Any other fitting sanction

                                            If an associated person is suspended, that person cannot remain associated with the member
                                       in any capacity, including a clerical or administrative capacity (during the suspension period, that
                                       person cannot remain on the member’s premises). The member is prohibited from paying a sal-
                                       ary, commission, or other remuneration that the person might have earned during the suspension
                                       period. The suspended person may be paid monies earned before the suspension period.

                                       2. 3. 2. 8. 1 Effective Date of Sanctions
                                           Other than a permanent cease and desist order, which is effective as of the decision date,
                                       sanctions imposed are effective on a date specified by the hearing officer, but no earlier than
                                       30 days after the written decision of the hearing panel is handed down.


                        2. 3. 2. 9         Appeals
                                           If either side is displeased with the decision, an appeal can be made to the NAC. Any
                                       appeal must be made within 25 days of service of the decision; otherwise, the decision is final.
                                       If no satisfaction is received from the NAC, the appealing party may take the case to the SEC.
                                       Again, if turned down, the appealing party has the right to continue the appeal process by tak-
                                       ing its case to the federal court system.
                                           Appealing a decision stays the effective date of most sanctions other than a permanent
                                       cease and desist order.


                        2. 3. 2. 10 Release of Disciplinary Information
                                           FINRA will release to the public through BrokerCheck® any disciplinary decision that
                                       imposes a suspension or expulsion of a member, suspends or revokes an associated person’s
                                       registration, suspends or bars an associated person, or imposes monetary sanctions of $15,000

                 CASE STUDY                                A registered representative was instructed to complete a syndicate worksheet
                                                      during an initial public offering to document compliance with the firm’s procedures
                                                      for new offerings. The worksheet included columns to record the date and manner
                                                      in which a preliminary prospectus was delivered. When the representative submit-
                                                      ted order tickets for sales to 15 customers, it became clear that the representative
                                                      did not deliver the red herrings. When asked about it by the branch office manager,
                                                      the representative claimed the firm was responsible for delivery of the preliminary
                                                      prospectuses. The branch office manager (BOM) suggested that the representative
                                                      should note on the worksheet that the prospectuses were hand delivered. The office
                                                      administrator relied upon that false information as part of the official records of the
                                                      firm. The NAC found that the representative had violated ethical standards and books
                                                      and records rules, and imposed a fine of $5,000.




       2. 4             DISPUTE RESOLUTION
                                    The Code of Arbitration was established to resolve principally money disputes. When
                                a customer sends a written complaint, a record must be made. It must include the complain-
                                ant’s name, address, and account number; the date it was received; the name of the associated
                                person identified in the complaint, and a description and the disposition of the complaint.
                                Arbitration is one method of resolving complaints.


       2. 4. 1                  UNIFORM CODE OF ARBITRATION (UCA)
                                    Arbitration is an alternative to going to court to resolve disputes. Arbitration panels com-
                                posed of one or three arbitrators weigh all the facts and then resolve the issue put before them.
                                The decision is called an award, and it is binding. In some exceptional cases, it may be chal-
                                lenged in court. Arbitration or mediation is mandatory in controversies involving a(n):
                                ■■ member against another member or registered clearing agency;
                                ■■ member against an associated person; or
                                ■■ associated person against another associated person.

                                           Over time, customer complaints became subject to mandatory arbitration. In the absence
                                       of a signed arbitration agreement, a customer can still force a member to arbitration, but a
                                       member cannot force a customer to arbitration. Today, virtually all on-boarding forms contain
                                       a predispute arbitration agreement that must be signed by customers before account opening.
                                       Thus, unresolved customer disputes must be heard under the Code of Arbitration.

                                                           If a customer requests a copy of the predispute arbitration agreement signed on
                                                       account opening, FINRA rules require firms to respond within 10 business days of the
                                                       request.

                                           Class action claims are not subject to arbitration. In addition, claims alleging employment
                                       discrimination, including sexual harassment claims, are not required to be arbitrated unless
                                       the parties agree.
                                           The advantages of arbitration over suits in state or federal courts are that time and money
                                       are saved and all decisions are final and binding; there are no appeals.

                                            Any party to an unresolved dispute can initiate proceedings by filing a Statement of Claim
                                       with the director of arbitration of FINRA. The Statement of Claim must describe in detail the
                                       controversy in dispute, include documentation in support of the claim, and state the remedy
                                       being sought (dollar amount). The claimant must include a check for the required claim filing
                                       fee. The director will then send a copy of the claim to the other party (respondent).
                                            The respondent then has 45 calendar days to respond to both the director and the claim-
                                       ant. The answer must specify all available defenses and any related counterclaim the respon-
                                       dent may have against the claimant. A respondent who fails to answer within 45 days may,
                                       in the sole discretion of the director, be barred from presenting any matter, arguments, or
                                       defenses at the hearing.
                                            The claimant, after receiving the respondent’s answer, must provide each party (the
                                       respondent and the director) with a written reply within 10 calendar days. At this point, the
                                       initial discovery is over.
                                            If the dispute involves irreparable injury to one of the parties, that party may seek an
                                       interim injunction or a permanent injunction. The party seeking relief must make a clear
                                       showing that its case is likely to succeed on its merits and that it will suffer permanent harm
                                       unless immediate relief is granted.


                  2. 4. 3              SELECTION OF ARBITRATORS
                                           In general, arbitrators are classified as being either public or non-public. Currently, a non-
                                       public arbitrator is a person who is an investment adviser or associated with a mutual or hedge
                                       fund, or within the past five years was, associated with the securities or futures industry. Also
                                       included are professionals, such as attorneys or accountants who have devoted 20% or more of
                                       their work, in the past two years, to clients engaged in the securities business.
                                           On the other hand, a public arbitrator is one who is not engaged in the securities business
                                       (including municipal and government debt and commodity futures) for a total of 20 years
                                       or more, is not an investment adviser, is not an employee of a bank, and is not an attorney
                                       or accountant whose firm derived 10% or more of its revenue in the past two years from the

                                securities business. FINRA, concerned that certain accountants or attorneys who fall below
                                the 10% test might still realize significant revenue from their arbitration work, has added a
                                revenue limitation to the definition of a public arbitrator. Attorneys, accountants, and other
                                professionals whose firms have derived $50,000 or more in annual revenue in either of the
                                past two years from arbitration work cannot function as public arbitrators. The definitions of
                                public and nonpublic arbitrators are subject to change. Please check with your instructor or
                                the Series 24 website.


       2. 4. 4                  PANEL COMPOSITION
                                    Customers involved in a dispute requiring three arbitrators (more than $100,000) can
                                directly choose from a list of public and nonpublic arbitrators. They can, for instance, select
                                an all-public arbitration panel.
                                    FINRA provides all parties with lists of 10 chair-qualified public arbitrators, 10 public
                                arbitrators, and 10 nonpublic arbitrators. The parties in the dispute may strike four arbitra-
                                tors on the chair-qualified public list and on the public list. However, any party could select
                                an all-public arbitration panel by striking all of the arbitrators on the nonpublic list. In dis-
                                putes in which the claimant is seeking more than $50,000 and up to $100,000, one arbitrator
                                hears the case unless the parties agree in writing to three arbitrators. If the claim is for more
                                than $100,000, whether industry disputes or customer disputes, the director of arbitration
                                will appoint a panel of three arbitrators, unless both parties agree in writing to one. A panel
                                chairperson always will preside, or if only one arbitrator is to hear a dispute, the arbitrator will
                                be selected from the chairperson roster. A chairperson must be a licensed attorney, trained by
                                FINRA in its rules, and served on at least three arbitrations.
                                    In an arbitration between member firms, the panel composition is:
                                ■■ if the panel consists of one arbitrator, the arbitrator will be a non-public arbitrator selected
                                    from the chairperson roster unless the parties agree in writing otherwise; or
                                ■■ if the panel consists of three arbitrators, all will be non-public arbitrators. One of the arbi-
                                    trators will be selected from the chairperson roster.

                                    In disputes between associated persons or between or among members and associated
                                persons:
                                ■■ if the panel consists of one arbitrator, the arbitrator will be a public arbitrator selected
                                    from the chairperson roster; or
                                ■■ if the panel consists of three arbitrators, one will be a non-public arbitrator and two will
                                    be public arbitrators. Again, one of the public arbitrators will be selected from the chair-
                                    person roster unless the parties agree in writing otherwise.

                                    The so-called mid-case referral rule allows an arbitration panel in unusual cases to alert
                                FINRA during the course of a hearing of their serious concern of an ongoing fraud they reason-
                                ably believe could lead to investor harm.


       2. 4. 5                  SIMPLIFIED ARBITRATION
                                     Any small claim dispute involving a dollar amount of $50,000 or less is eligible for simpli-
                                fied arbitration. For disputes with customers, a single, chair-qualified, public arbitrator reviews
                                all the evidence and renders a binding decision within 30 business days. Both parties must
                                agree to this procedure or a formal hearing is required. Disputes between industry parties may
                                be heard by a single, chair-qualified, nonpublic arbitrator.

                  2. 4. 6              AWARDS
                                           All monetary awards must be paid within 30 days of decision date. Any award not paid
                                       within this time will begin to accrue interest as of the decision date.


                  2. 4. 7              FAILURE TO ACT
                                          It is a violation of FINRA rules for a member or an associated person to fail to:
                                       ■■ submit a dispute for arbitration;
                                       ■■ comply with any injunction order;
                                       ■■ appear or produce any document as directed;
                                       ■■ honor an award; or
                                       ■■ comply with an executed collective agreement obtained as the result of mediation.

                                           Action by members requiring associated persons to waive the arbitration of disputes is also
                                       a rules violation.


                  2. 4. 8              STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS
                                          No claim is eligible for submission to arbitration if six years or more have elapsed from the
                                       event giving rise to the claim.

                                                       serious concerns regarding a possible fraud that they reasonably believe could lead to

       2. 4. 10 MEDIATION
                                    An alternate dispute resolution process and a reasonable, inexpensive first step is media-
                                tion. If both parties agree, prior to the opening of hearings, a meeting may be held in an
                                attempt to work out a settlement. A mediator is selected to preside over the discussions and
                                to assist the parties, if possible, in reaching their own solution. If mediation is unsuccessful, a
                                hearing is conducted. A mediator is prohibited from serving on an arbitration panel regard-
                                ing any matter in which that person served as mediator. Sometimes, parts of a dispute settle
                                in mediation, leaving fewer differences to be settled in arbitration, which can translate into
                                savings of time and money. The issue is settled when the Memo of Understanding (MOU) is
                                signed.

                                      The plan must address, at a minimum, the following:
                                   ■■ Data backup and recovery (hard copy and electronic)
                                   ■■ Alternate communications between the firm and its customers
                                   ■■ Alternate communications between the firm and its employees
                                   ■■ Alternate physical location of employees
                                   ■■ Communications with regulators
                                   ■■ How the firm will ensure customers prompt access to their funds and securities in the event
                                      the firm is unable to continue its business
                                   ■■ All mission-critical systems

                                       Further, a firm must disclose to its customers how it will respond to events of varying scope.
                                   This disclosure must be made, in writing, to customers at account opening, posted on the firm’s
                                   website, and mailed to customers on request.
                                       FINRA Rule 4370 requires firms to report to FINRA, typically electronically, the
                                   emergency contact information for the member, which must include the designation of two
                                   associated persons as emergency contact persons. At least one of the emergency contacts
                                   must be a member of senior management and a registered principal. If the other emergency
                                   contact person is not a registered principal, he or she must be a member of senior management
                                   who is at least knowledgeable about the member’s business operations. Those members that
                                   have only one associated person must designate as a second emergency contact person an
                                   individual, either registered with another firm (such as in a JBO), or a nonregistered person
                                   who has knowledge of the member’s business operations (e.g., clearing firm contact, attorney,
                                   accountant).
                                       As a reminder from Unit 1, NASD Rule 1160 requires firms to update the contact
                                   information promptly, but no later than 30 days following any change. Member firms must
                                   review the contact information within 17 business days after the end of each calendar year
                                   and make an electronic attestation that the annual review was accurately completed.


                  2. 5. 3          CONTROL RELATIONSHIPS
                                        If a member controls or is controlled by an issuer of securities, a control relationship is
                                   said to exist between the two. If such a relationship exists, a member, before recommending
                                   the purchase (or sale) of the issuer’s securities, must disclose to the customer the existence of
                                   such control, and if the disclosure is not made in writing at that time, it must be disclosed on
                                   the customer’s confirmation.
                                        These disclosure rules also apply to discretionary accounts. Before purchasing these securi-
                                   ties, the member must disclose to the customer the existence of the control relationship.


                  2. 5. 4          DIRECT PARTICIPATION PROGRAMS (DPPS)
                                       A DPP, which is normally structured as a limited partnership, is a program that provides
                                   flow-through tax consequences to investors. These programs are high risk, illiquid, and long
                                   term in nature.




                               *

                                    Before participating in a DPP offering, member firms must have reasonable grounds for
                                believing, based on the information provided in the prospectus, that all material facts are
                                adequately disclosed and that these facts provide a framework for customers to evaluate the
                                program.
                                    Under FINRA rules, all DPPs must have clearly stated standards of suitability in the pro-
                                spectus. In recommending a DPP to a customer, a member firm must be certain that the pro-
                                gram is consistent with the customer’s objectives and that the customer:
                                ■■ is in a position to take full advantage of any tax benefits generated by the DPP; and
                                ■■ has a net worth sufficient to sustain the risks of the DPP, including loss of investment.

                                    The member, after making a suitability determination, must maintain in its file documents
                                that describe the basis on which the determination of suitability was made. In addition, no
                                member is permitted to execute a DPP transaction in a discretionary account without the prior
                                written consent of the customer.


             2. 5. 4. 1               DPP Roll-Up
                                     A roll-up is a transaction involving the combination or reorganization of one or more
                                limited partnerships into securities of a successor corporation. The lure to investors is the pos-
                                sibility of turning an illiquid DPP into a more liquid security.
                                     Disclosure documents prepared in connection with a proposed roll-up transaction must:
                                ■■ disclose all the risk factors;
                                ■■ disclose the general partner’s belief concerning fairness of the transaction; and
                                ■■ include all reports, opinions, and appraisals received by the general partner in connection
                                     with the transaction.

                                   Failure to provide adequate disclosure of a negative opinion rendered by an investment
                                banker or financial adviser concerning fairness constitutes fraud.
                                   Under FINRA rules, members are prohibited from soliciting votes from limited partners in
                                connection with a proposed roll-up unless any compensation to be received by the member:
                                ■■ is payable and equal in amount regardless of whether the limited partners vote affirma-
                                   tively or negatively; and
                                ■■ does not exceed 2% of the value of the securities to be received in the exchange.


       2. 5. 5                  NONCONVENTIONAL INVESTMENTS (NCIS)
                                    NCIs are alternative investments that do not fit a common category. Examples include
                                hedge funds, certain asset-backed securities, and distressed debt. Distressed debt is defined as
                                corporate bonds of companies that have either filed for bankruptcy or appear likely to do so in
                                the near future. The strategy involves first becoming a major creditor of the target company by
                                acquiring the company’s bonds at pennies on the dollar. This gives these investors the neces-
                                sary leverage and control during either the reorganization or the liquidation of the company.
                                In the event of liquidation, distressed debt holders, by standing ahead of the equity holders,
                                often recover a high percentage of the par value of the bonds, thus making the return on
                                investment substantial.
                                    However, the more desirable outcome is a reorganization that allows the company to
                                emerge from bankruptcy protection. As part of the reorganization, distressed debt holders, in
                                exchange for their bonds, often receive enough equity in the new firm to compensate them
                                well for the risks taken.

                                           FINRA is concerned that retail investors do not fully comprehend the risks associated
                                       with these NCIs. Accordingly, FINRA requires members that sell these products to:
                                       ■■ conduct appropriate due diligence;
                                       ■■ perform a reasonable-basis suitability analysis;
                                       ■■ perform a customer-specific suitability analysis for recommended transactions;
                                       ■■ ensure that promotional materials used are accurate and balanced;
                                       ■■ implement appropriate internal controls; and
                                       ■■ provide training to persons selling these products.

                                            In performing due diligence, members must look at the liquidity of the product, the exis-
                                       tence of a secondary market, interest rate risk, credit risk, the tax consequences of the product,
                                       and the costs associated with purchasing and selling the product.
                                            A reasonable-basis suitability analysis is necessary to ensure that an investment is suitable
                                       for some investors, as opposed to a customer-specific suitability determination, which is under-
                                       taken on a customer-by-customer basis.
                                            An equity-linked note (ELN) is an example of a nonconventional investment. It is a debt
                                       instrument that differs from a conventional fixed income security in that the final payment at
                                       maturity is based, in part, on the return of the underlying equity, which can be a single stock, a
                                       basket of stocks, or an equity index. A typical ELN is principal protected; the investor is guar-
                                       anteed to receive, at maturity, 100% of the original amount invested but receives no interest
                                       along the way. The final payout, in cash, is the amount invested plus a portion of the gain on
                                       the underlying equity. If the underling equity remains flat or declines during the investment
                                       period, all the investor receives at maturity is the original amount invested. Also note that
                                       there is generally no secondary market for these products during the investment period, which
                                       can range up to five years. ELNs not listed on a national exchange must be reported to Trade
                                       Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE).

                                                       discretionary account, a member needs the prior written consent of the customer.
                                                       Discretionary trades need approval from an authorized principal promptly following

                                           As part of the account opening process, the customer and the registered representative
                                       establish registration and delivery instructions. These instructions may be changed for indi-
                                       vidual transactions. For purchase orders, the customer must stipulate whose name is to be on
                                       the security and who will keep the security certificate.
                                           Customers may select any of the following delivery instructions.
                                       ■■ Transfer and ship. Securities are transferred into the name of the customer and shipped.
                                       ■■ Transfer and hold in safekeeping. Securities are transferred into the customer’s name but
                                           are held by the broker-dealer.
                                       ■■ Hold in street name. Securities are transferred into the broker-dealer’s name and held by
                                           the broker-dealer. Although the broker-dealer is the nominal owner of the securities, the
                                           customer is the beneficial owner.

                                   provides the member firm with the name, address, and account number on file with the

                                                      —— 2. If a member firm is recommending an issuer’s securities to a customer
                                                      and a control relationship exists between the issuer and the member, the relationship
                                                      must be disclosed either in writing before the recommendation or on the customer’s

       2. 6. 1                  ACCOUNTS FOR INVESTMENT ADVISERS
                                     An investment adviser is one who, for an annual fee, manages customer assets. The adviser
                                will open an account at a member firm to trade securities for each advisory client. Advisers
                                with a small number of clients will open individual accounts with a member, and the client
                                provides the adviser with third-party trading authority.
                                     Confirmations of trades and customer account statements are sent by the member to the
                                customer and the investment adviser.
                                     If an investment adviser has a large number of clients, the adviser may open a special
                                omnibus account with a member to hold securities purchased for each client. The account is
                                a single master account in the name of the adviser. In opening a special omnibus account, the
                                adviser must disclose to the member that the securities in the account are customer securities,
                                and not those of the adviser.

                                                           When a broker-dealer offers a wrap fee program, it then loses its exclusion from

                                                       programs, because they don’t execute trades.



                  2. 6. 2              DVP ACCOUNTS (DELIVERY VERSUS PAYMENT)
                                            A DVP account is one in which payment for securities purchased or delivery of securities
                                       sold is to be made by an agent bank. Before accepting such accounts, a member must have on
                                       file the name and address of the agent and the account number of the customer on file with
                                       the agent. In such transactions, members must get assurances from the customer that proper
                                       instructions have been given to the agent bank (e.g., to receive securities against payment
                                       [COD] or to deliver securities against payment [POD]).
                                            There is no requirement for the firm to contact the agent bank in advance of settlement to
                                       ensure the funds are available to pay, in the case of a purchase, or that securities are available
                                       for delivery, in the case of a sale.
                                            These trades settle regular way (three business days after trade date). However, if deliv-
                                       ery is delayed due to the mechanics of the transaction and is not related to the customer’s
                                       willingness or ability to pay, the member has up to 35 calendar days from trade date to obtain
                                       payment.
                                            One point about DVP accounts that might be raised on the exam is that, under NASD
                                       Rule 2340, if the customer’s account is carried solely for the purpose of execution on a DVP/
                                       RVP basis, and all transactions effected for the account are done on a DVP/RVP basis, it may
                                       not be necessary to send the customer quarterly statements. This is a major exception to the
                                       rule.


                  2. 6. 3              FEE-BASED ACCOUNTS
                                           Fee-based accounts are those that are charged a fixed fee monthly or annually as an alter-
                                       native to traditional commission-based charges for brokerage services. Unlike wrap accounts,
                                       these accounts do not provide advisory services. They are generally appropriate for custom-
                                       ers with a moderate to high level of trading activity. They are not appropriate for customers
                                       with a buy-and-hold strategy. FINRA rules require firms to periodically review all fee-based
                                       accounts to determine if they remain appropriate. The practice of putting clients into fee-
                                       based accounts who trade infrequently is known as reverse churning.


                  2. 6. 4              PRIME BROKERAGE ACCOUNTS
                                           A prime brokerage account is one in which a customer, generally an institution, selects
                                       one member firm (the prime broker) to provide custody and financing of securities while other
                                       firms, called executing brokers, handle all trades placed by the customer. Under SEC rules,
                                       prime brokerage customers must maintain a minimum of $500,000 in equity in the account.
                                           To open a prime brokerage account for a customer, a member (the prime broker) must sign
                                       an agreement with the customer explaining the terms of the agreement as well as names of all
                                       executing brokers with whom the customer has contracted. The prime broker then enters into
                                       written agreements with each executing broker named by the customer.

                                    The customer receives trade confirmations and customer account statements from the
                                prime broker, while responsibility for compliance with the short sale rule rests with the execut-
                                ing brokers. That said, the prime broker is often relied on for stock lending.

       2. 7             MARGIN TRANSACTIONS/EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT


       2. 7. 1                  FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD REGULATION
                                     Purchasing securities on margin is like buying securities on credit. The customer provides
                                a portion of the purchase price (initial margin requirement) with the balance loaned to the
                                customer by the member firm. The firm becomes the customer’s creditor, so all securities pur-
                                chased on margin are registered in street name.
                                     Utilizing Regulation T, the Federal Reserve Board sets the initial margin requirements for
                                nonexempt securities. Currently, the Regulation T requirement, also referred to as the Fed
                                call, is 50% of the market value of the securities being purchased on margin.

                                                      meets the Fed call by depositing $15,000 (50% of $30,000) while the remaining
                                                      $15,000 is loaned to the customer by the member.

                                                       means it may be used as collateral for a loan (e.g., IBM stock is marginable). Margin is
                                                       the money required for a transaction (e.g., to buy $10,000 worth of stock, the margin
                                                       is $5,000).

                                                       accounts, it is unlikely that you will have more than one or two questions that require
                                                       a simple calculation.


                        2. 7. 1. 1         Requests for Extensions of Time Under Regulation T and
                                           SEC Rule 15c3-3 (FINRA Rule 4230)
                                           Clearing firms that submit requests for extensions of time in their effort to satisfy
                                       Regulation T or the reserve requirements of the Customer Protection Rule (see 2.16.1), must
                                       submit the request to FINRA for approval. A member clearing firm must also file a monthly
                                       report denoting all broker-dealers for which it clears that have overall ratios of requests for
                                       extensions of time to total transactions for the month that exceed the percentage stipulated
                                       by FINRA (currently 2%). That report is due to FINRA within five business days following
                                       the end of the month. For those months when no broker-dealer for which it clears exceeds the
                                       extension-of-time ratio criteria, the clearing firm must also submit a report indicating that no
                                       extensions were requested.


                  2. 7. 2              MARGIN AGREEMENT
                                          Before letting a customer trade on margin, the customer must sign a margin agreement,
                                       which has three basic components: (1) the hypothecation agreement, (2) the credit agree-
                                       ment, and (3) the loan consent agreement.
                                       ■■ Hypothecation agreement. By signing, the customer allows the member to use the cus-
                                          tomer’s securities as collateral for a loan.
                                       ■■ Credit agreement. This agreement explains how the member will compute the interest to
                                          be charged to the customer for the money borrowed to finance the purchase. The inter-
                                          est rate, which varies daily, is based on the call loan rate published each day in financial
                                          media.
                                       ■■ Loan consent agreement. By signing, the customer allows the member to loan out the
                                          customer’s margin securities for short sales.

                                     At or before opening a margin account, members must deliver to noninstitutional custom-
                                ers a disclosure document that addresses the risks associated with trading on margin. Further,
                                a margin disclosure document also must be provided to margin customers on an annual basis.
                                     It is deemed fraudulent and deceptive to offer to sell, or attempt to sell, a security where
                                the broker-dealer offers to extend any credit or arrange for a loan unless the member firm
                                first delivers a written statement stating the exact nature of the risks and charges associated
                                with borrowing money for entering into securities transactions. In addition, the broker-dealer
                                must obtain from the customer sufficient financial information as to enable the firm to make
                                a reasonable determination as to whether the margin is suitable for a particular customer. The
                                broker-dealer is obligated to maintain in its files a written statement setting forth the basis for
                                the determination.
                                     Those investors who choose to trade securities through a margin account face additional
                                risks that must be disclosed to those opening such an account. No member firm is permitted
                                to open a margin account for a non-institutional account without the firm furnishing the
                                customer a margin disclosure statement. If the account is open online, or to execute transac-
                                tions online, firms have the additional requirement to post the disclosure conspicuously on the
                                member firm’s website.

                                                           Margin trading in a trust account is permitted only if it is specifically provided for

       2. 7. 3                  MARGIN RISK DISCLOSURES (RULE 2264)
                                    As previously stated, a member firm may not open a margin account for a non-institu-
                                tional client without making the following risk disclosures prior to or at the time of account
                                opening and annually thereafter:
                                ■■ You can lose more funds than you deposit in the margin account. A decline in the value
                                    of securities that are purchased on margin may require you to provide additional funds to
                                    the firm that has made the loan to avoid the forced sale of those securities or other securi-
                                    ties or assets in your account(s).
                                ■■ The firm can force the sale of securities or other assets in your account(s). If the
                                    equity in your account falls below the maintenance margin requirements, or the firm’s
                                    higher “house” requirements, the firm can sell the securities or other assets in any of your
                                    accounts held at the firm to cover the margin deficiency. You also will be responsible for
                                    any short fall in the account after such a sale.
                                ■■ The firm can sell your securities or other assets without contacting you. Some investors
                                    mistakenly believe that a firm must contact them for a margin call to be valid, and that
                                    the firm cannot liquidate securities or other assets in their accounts to meet the call unless
                                    the firm has contacted them first. This is not the case. Most firms will attempt to notify
                                    their customers of margin calls, but they are not required to do so. However, even if a firm
                                    has contacted a customer and provided a specific date by which the customer can meet a
                                    margin call, the firm still can take necessary steps to protect its financial interests, includ-
                                    ing immediately selling the securities without notice to the customer.
                                ■■ You are not entitled to choose which securities or other assets in your account(s)
                                    are liquidated or sold to meet a margin call. Because the securities are collateral for the
                                    margin loan, the firm has the right to decide which security to sell in order to protect its
                                    interests.

                                 ■■ The firm can increase its “house” maintenance margin requirements at any time and
                                    is not required to provide you advance written notice. These changes in firm policy
                                    often take effect immediately and may result in the issuance of a maintenance margin call.
                                    Your failure to satisfy the call may cause the member to liquidate or sell securities in your
                                    account(s).
                                 ■■ You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call. While an extension of time
                                    to meet margin requirements may be available to customers under certain conditions, a
                                    customer does not have a right to the extension.

                                     These disclosures can be in paper or electronic form and in a separate document or con-
                                 tained by itself on a separate page as part of another document. If retail customers can open
                                 accounts or trade online, the margin disclosure statement must be posted on the firm’s website.


                  2. 7. 4        MARGIN REQUIREMENTS (FINRA RULE 4210)
                                     Using the purchase of 1,000 shares at $30 per share as an example, the account would look
                                 like this:

                                               Long market value –        debit balance         =      equity         %
                                                   $30,000       –          $15,000             =     $15,000        50%

                                      Keeping in mind that these numbers are for illustration, the equity represents the custom-
                                 er’s initial margin requirement, while the debit balance represents the money loaned to the
                                 customer by the member. The mechanics of financing the purchase are as follows: the member
                                 firm takes $21,000 worth of XYZ stock to a bank for a loan (the customer signed the hypoth-
                                 ecation agreement, which permits this). The bank then loans $15,000 to the member at the
                                 call loan rate. The member then reloans $15,000 to the customer at the call loan rate plus 2%.
                                      The customer’s securities are being used as collateral for a loan being made to that cus-
                                 tomer. The bank is in good shape, because it has $21,000 of stock collateralizing a $15,000
                                 loan. The member is in good shape, because it is borrowing and immediately relending, mak-
                                 ing two points in the process. It is the customer who is at risk.


                        2. 7. 4. 1   140% Rule
                                     The amount of customer securities that can be pledged to a bank for a loan is limited to
                                 140% of the customer’s debit balance (140% × $15,000 = $21,000). This is SEC Rule 15c2-1,
                                 which is designed to ensure that a member does not borrow more from a bank, using customer
                                 securities as collateral, than the member reloans to the customer.



                               !
                      TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                     Although the firm can hypothecate 140% of the customer debit balance, the firm
                                                 can never borrow from the bank more than 100% of the debit balance. The firm can
                                                 borrow no more than it reloans to the customer.

                                    A restricted margin account is one in which the percentage equity (margin) in the
                                account has fallen below the initial 50% requirement. This occurs if the market value of the
                                securities falls.

                                                          The percentage equity in this restricted account is now 44% (12 ÷ 27). To de-

                                                      $27,000, the account would need $13,500 in equity to be at 50%. Because there is
                                                      $12,000 in equity currently in the account, the account is restricted by $1,500.

                                                          Regarding restricted accounts: First, there is no requirement for the customer to
                                                      provide additional money. This only occurs if the account falls below the minimum
                                                      maintenance margin requirement of 25% (discussed later in this Unit).
                                                           Second, the customer is permitted to make additional purchases in a restricted
                                                      account. All the customer has to do is put up 50% of any subsequent purchase.
                                                      When securities are sold in a restricted account, at least half the proceeds must be
                                                      retained in the account (the retention requirement) to reduce the debit balance. The
                                                      other half may be removed by the customer.

                                     If the market value of securities purchased in a long margin account rises above initial
                                cost, a special memorandum account (SMA) is created. As a rule of thumb, for each dollar
                                rise in market value above cost, $.50 of SMA is created.

                                                          The market value rose by $4,000, thereby creating $2,000 of SMA. The $2,000
                                                      of SMA is often referred to as excess equity (equity in excess of 50% of the current
                                                      market value). 50% × 34,000 = $17,000, which, when compared to the current
                                                      equity of $19,000, shows that the account has excess of $2,000.

                                            Once SMA is created, the customer has two basic options. First, the customer can use
                                       SMA to buy additional securities in the account without putting up additional money. This
                                       is termed buying power, which is two times the SMA. The second option is to withdraw the
                                       SMA from the account, dollar for dollar, in cash.
                                            With SMA of $2,000, the account has buying power of $4,000, which means the customer
                                       can purchase $4,000 of stock without putting up additional money. Keeping in mind that it is
                                       highly unlikely that you will need to compute anything on the Series 24, for illustration:
                                                           LMV         –         DB        =        EQ              SMA
                                                          $34,000      –       $15,000     =      $19,000          $2,000

                                           If the customer bought $4,000 worth of stock, the account would look as follows:
                                                            LMV         –        DB        =        EQ              SMA
                                                           $38,000      –      $19,000     =      $19,000            0

                                           The member purchased $4,000 of stock for the customer and financed the purchase by
                                       increasing the customer’s debit balance (amount borrowed by the customer) by $4,000 to
                                       $19,000. The customer paid for the stock indirectly by borrowing more money. At this point,
                                       the SMA balance becomes zero, because the $2,000 of SMA has been fully used.

                                                           SMA is not equity, nor is it cash. It is a line of credit created when market value
                                                      moves up. Using that line, either through buying power or withdrawal, increases the
                                                      customer’s debit balance. While an increase in market value over original cost cre-
                                                      ates SMA, a subsequent decline in market value has no effect on SMA. Once created,
                                                      SMA remains in the account until used, regardless of what happens to market value.
                                                          SMA can always be used, even in restricted accounts, as long as the use, either
                                                      through buying power or withdrawal, does not bring the account below minimum
                                                      (25%).

                                          As noted previously, the minimum maintenance margin requirement is 25% of the current

                                    A firm’s SRO sets minimum maintenance requirements. Once a customer meets the initial
                                Fed call of 50%, the percentage equity in the account can fall all the way to 25% without a
                                maintenance margin call being sent. Once the percentage equity falls below 25%, the member
                                sends the customer a maintenance call for an amount sufficient to bring the account back to
                                minimum.

                                    A customer, after purchasing securities on margin, might ask the registered representative
                                when a maintenance call will be sent if the value of the securities declines. The customer
                                wants to know to what market value the securities would have to fall for the account to be
                                right at minimum. This market value is termed maintenance market value.

                                    To meet a Fed call, the customer can deposit cash (i.e., a check) in the amount of the call
                                or can deposit fully paid-for marginable securities with a market value equal to twice the call.

                  2. 8             SHORT SELLING
                                           A short sale involves the sale of a security the customer does not own. In order to deliver
                                       the security to the buyer no later than the settlement date, the customer must borrow security,
                                       usually from a broker-dealer or an institutional investor. Essentially, a short sale is the sale of
                                       borrowed stock. The short seller may profit if the stock declines in value and has potentially
                                       unlimited loss if the stock appreciates.

                                                       dollar with the decline. If the market value of the short position is rising, the equity
                                                       will fall dollar-for-dollar with the rise. In essence, both positions are moving against
                                                       the customer.

                                            As a supervisor, consider that, although short selling serves useful market purposes, selling
                                       short also may be done to drive down the price of a stock or to hasten a declining market in
                                       a stock. In some cases, short selling may be used to manipulate stock prices and subject the
                                       offender to criminal justice. In addition, selling short is completely unsuitable for some risk-
                                       averse investors. Explaining the risks associated with short selling is of critical importance to
                                       filling the role of a supervising principal and compliance officer.


                  2. 8. 1              BORROWING
                                            Securities can be borrowed from several sources: the member firm executing the short
                                       sale on behalf of the customer; margin customers of that member firm; other member firms;
                                       and institutional investors, such as pension plans and custodial banks, like State Street Bank
                                       or Bank of New York Mellon, that rank among the biggest lenders of securities in the world.
                                       When opening a margin account, customers often sign a loan consent agreement that allows
                                       custodians to lend customer margin securities from the portfolio. Certain sophisticated inves-
                                       tors and institutional customers, such as pension funds, lend securities (this is especially use-
                                       ful for hard-to-find-securities) to generate additional income in their portfolios by collecting
                                       loans.

                                    Often, retail investors are unaware that by lending securities to short sellers who are apply-
                                ing downward pressure to the borrowed shares, they may be working against themselves. A
                                supervising principal should be able to explain this inherent conflict of interest to inquiring
                                retail customers.


       2. 8. 2                  RULE 10B-21
                                     SEC Rule 10b-21 is an anti-fraud rule that addresses fails-to-deliver transactions associated
                                with “naked” short selling. It is targeted at short sellers who purposely mislead a broker-dealer
                                about their ability or intention to deliver securities by the settlement date, thereby causing a
                                fail to deliver. In addition, it targets short sellers who deceive broker-dealers about their source
                                of borrowable securities to satisfy the location requirement of Regulation SHO, as well as long
                                sellers who falsify to their broker-dealers that they actually own the shares being sold.


       2. 8. 3                  LENDER’S PRIVILEGES
                                     The stock lender retains certain privileges, such as the right to cash dividends on the
                                loaned stock. Dividends are paid by the issuer to the owner of record—the person who bought
                                the shares from the short seller. However, the short seller must make good to the lender for the
                                cash dividends the lender is no longer receiving. To ensure compliance, the member firm, on
                                dividend payment date, will debit the short seller’s account the amount of the cash dividend
                                for credit to the stock lender.
                                     Further, the lender retains the right to any stock dividends or stock splits. Again, these
                                additional shares will be paid by the issuer to the owner of record. The short seller makes good
                                to the lender when the stock is bought back for return to the lender. At this point, the short
                                seller will return not only the number of shares originally borrowed, but the additional shares
                                resulting from the distribution as well.
                                     Whenever a customer effects a short sale of stock, the member firm must make a deter-
                                mination that the shares can be borrowed (locate requirement). This determination must
                                be noted on the order ticket. Member firms, rather than making a determination for each
                                individual short sale, may rely on a blanket or standing assurance that the securities will be
                                available for borrowing on settlement date.
                                     The assurance generally takes the form of a list (paper or electronic) of securities available.
                                Under FINRA rules, the list can be no more than 24 hours old (updated daily).



            TEST TOPIC ALERT
                            !                              Two important test points regarding short sales include the following.
                                                           ■■ A short seller is required to remit cash dividends paid by the issuer to the
                                                              buyer of the stock to the stock lender.

                                                           ■■ The locate requirement for short sales can be made from an available
                                                              securities list if the list is updated once per business day. This list is sometimes
                                                              referred to as an easy-to-borrow list.

                               CASE STUDY
                                                         Regulation SHO requires a broker-dealer to have reasonable grounds to believe
                                                    that the security could be borrowed and available for delivery before accepting or
                                                    effecting a short sale. Furthermore, it requires a broker-dealer to mark sales of equity
                                                    securities as long or short.
                                                         The OTC equity trading firm of TNT & Associates of Montauk, NY, a member
                                                    of FINRA and SIPC, effected millions of short sales without reasonable grounds to
                                                    believe the securities could be obtained. As a result, those short sale orders were ei-
                                                    ther mismarked, placed to the market without reasonable grounds to believe that the
                                                    securities could be borrowed and delivered, or both.
                                                         FINRA found that its Reg SHO supervisory system regarding locates and the
                                                    marking of sale orders was significantly flawed and resulted in a systemic supervisory
                                                    failure that contributed to serious Reg SHO failures across its equities trading business.
                                                         FINRA fined TNT $12.5 million for violating Reg SHO and for failing to properly
                                                    supervise short sales of securities. It was deemed that the scope and volume of TNT’s
                                                    locate and order-marking violations created the potential for significant harm to the
                                                    integrity of the market.


                        2. 8. 3. 1      Cheap Stock Rule
                                       For stock trading at less than $5 per share, the minimum margin required to short these
                                    cheap stocks is 100% of market value or $2.50 per share, whichever is greater.

                                                    than the initial Regulation T requirement of 50%.

                                    MARGINABLE SECURITIES
                                        The Federal Reserve Board sets the initial margin requirement for nonexempt securities
                                    and also determines which nonexempt securities can be purchased on margin. As a general
                                    rule, all National Market System securities are marginable. All other OTC equity securities
                                    are marginable only if they are on the Federal Reserve’s marginable securities list. This list is
                                    updated periodically.
                                        In addition, exempt securities, such as U.S. government and municipal bonds, are margin-
                                    able. Margin requirements on exempt securities are set by the SROs, not the Fed.

                                                           New issues cannot be purchased on margin. They must trade in the secondary
                                                      market at least 30 days before becoming eligible for purchase on margin. Similarly,
                                                      mutual funds cannot be purchased on margin. After holding mutual funds fully paid

                                                      purchase of stock.

                                     Standardized nine-month put or call options are not marginable; these are expiring securi-
                                ties that have no loan value. Customers buying options must pay the premium in full.

       2. 8. 5                  OTHER FRB RULES
                                    When a customer buys stock, the member expects payment by regular way settlement
                                date, which is three business days following trade date. Regulation T, however, allows custom-
                                ers an additional two business days to pay for securities purchased. Under Regulation T, the
                                customer must pay promptly, but no later than five business days from trade date.
                                    If payment is not received by the fifth business day and the member has not applied for
                                (or did not receive) an extension of time from the member’s DEA, the position must be sold
                                out on the morning of the sixth business day, and the account is frozen for 90 days. This rule
                                applies to both cash and margin accounts.

                                                           Extension requests for an introducing broker-dealer are made by its clearing firm.
                                                      To monitor extension requests, FINRA requires clearing firms to keep a daily record
                                                      of required margin and extension of time requests and to file monthly reports, within

                                            Another Regulation T rule deals with freeriding. Member firms cannot permit customers
                                       to make a practice of buying stock for which the cost is met by the sale of the same securities.
                                       If a customer buys stock on Monday and sells on Tuesday prior to paying for the purchase, the
                                       member must enter the sell order and freeze the account. The account will be unfrozen if the
                                       customer’s check is received by the fifth business day from trade date.
                                            Member firms are permitted to establish margin requirements—across the board or for
                                       selected securities—that are more restrictive than those of the regulatory authorities.

                                EXAMPLE                    Most member firms have minimum maintenance margin requirements for long
                                                       and short positions that exceed the 25% and 30% levels established by FINRA. Some
                                                       firms have established initial requirements for volatile internet stocks in excess of the
                                                       Regulation T 50% requirement. Often, the expression “house maintenance” is used
                                                       to describe stricter limits imposed by broker-dealers.

                                            All margin accounts are marked to the market daily, which means the member compares
                                       purchase price (or short sales proceeds) with current market price to determine whether there
                                       is any excess (SMA) or deficiency (restriction) in the account. The price used is last sale as of
                                       the prior business day.

                  2. 8. 6              PATTERN DAY TRADERS
                                            A day trader is one who buys and sells the same security on the same day to try to take
                                       advantage of intraday price movements. A pattern day trader is one who executes four or
                                       more day trades in a five-business-day period.
                                            Under FINRA rules, the minimum equity requirement for pattern day traders is $25,000
                                       (pattern day traders must have on deposit in the account equity of at least $25,000 on any day
                                       on which day trading occurs). The minimum maintenance margin requirement for pattern day
                                       traders is 25%, which is the same as for regular customers.
                                            Pattern day traders also are treated differently when it comes to buying power. Buying
                                       power for day traders is four times the maintenance margin excess. Maintenance margin
                                       excess is defined as the equity in the account above the 25% minimum requirement. For regu-
                                       lar customers, buying power is two times SMA.
                                            Margin rules also prohibit day trading accounts from using account guarantees that are
                                       otherwise permitted.
                                            A cross guarantee is one in which another customer agrees, in writing, to the use of money
                                       or securities in his account to carry the guaranteed accounts (e.g., to meet any margin calls).

       2. 8. 7                  PORTFOLIO MARGIN ACCOUNTS
                                     Portfolio margining is a different way to calculate margin requirements for an account.
                                It is based on the net risks of a portfolio of securities as a whole rather than on standardized
                                percentages applied to each position in a portfolio. Margin requirements based on net risk are
                                generally lower than those calculated conventionally, thereby achieving higher leverage.
                                     In order to offer portfolio margining to customers, the following rules apply:
                                ■■ A firm must file an application with, and receive approval from, its DEA.
                                ■■ Only customers that have been approved for uncovered option writing are eligible.
                                ■■ Portfolio margin customers must receive and acknowledge in writing a risk disclosure
                                     statement at or prior to the initial transaction.

                                     Firms must establish minimum equity requirements for portfolio margin accounts. FINRA’s
                                guidelines are set at $100,000 for customers of firms that have real-time intraday monitoring
                                systems, $150,000 for customers of firms without real-time intraday monitoring systems, and
                                $500,000 for prime broker customers or introduced account customers where trades may be
                                executed away from the clearing firm.
                                     The NYSE requires that customers must have and maintain $5 million in those accounts
                                with positions in unlisted derivatives.
                                     Securities that are eligible for portfolio margining include equity securities; listed options
                                including LEAPS, warrants, futures, and derivatives; and exchange traded funds. Debt securi-
                                ties are subject to conventional margin rules. Further, margin maintenance calls must be met
                                within three business days.


       2. 8. 8                  EXCHANGE-TRADED FUNDS (ETFS)
                                    ETFs are typically registered as unit investment trusts (UITs) or open-end investment
                                companies. Shares in an ETF represent an interest in a portfolio of securities that track an
                                underlying index. There is little active management. Since 2008, the SEC does permit, on a
                                limited basis, exemptive relief for some types of ETFs to permit a more active management
                                effort. Unlike traditional UITs or mutual funds, shares of ETFs generally trade as any other
                                stock on the floor of an exchange and are subject to market forces.
                                    A few ETFs direct investment dollars to commodities and currencies. This type of ETF is
                                not registered as an investment company.

                                2. 8. 8. 1. 1 Leveraged ETFs

                                     A leveraged ETF is designed with the view to generate multiples of 200% or 300% of the
                                underlying index it tracks. Leveraged ETFs use futures and swaps to amplify the daily returns
                                on its benchmark. For example, a daily large cap bull 3× shares would attempt to provide daily
                                returns amounting to 300% of the daily return on its target index. If that index, for example
                                the Russell 1000, rises 1% for a single trading session, the shares in the leverage ETF should
                                rise by about 3%. Because leveraged ETFs use options, swaps, and futures, they are inherently
                                more volatile than their underlying index.

                               2. 8. 8. 1. 2 Inverse ETFs

                                    Some leveraged ETFs are “inverse” or “short” funds. These ETFs look to deliver the oppo-
                               site of the performance of the index or benchmark they track.

                               2. 8. 8. 1. 3 Margin Requirements for ETFs

                                  Because leveraged ETFs experience higher volatility compared to their non-leveraged
                               ETFs, higher margin requirements are placed on them.

                               2. 8. 8. 1. 4 Strategy-Based Margin Account

                                   In a strategy-based margin account, the maintenance margin requirement for any long
                               ETF was 25% of the market value, and for any short ETF, the maintenance margin require-
                               ment was generally 30% of the market value.
                                   Maintenance margin requirements are now a percentage commensurate with the leverage
                               of the ETF, not to exceed 100% of the value of the ETF, as detailed in the following examples:
                               ■■ Long 100 shares ABC ETF @ 28.00 (200% leverage) market value: 2,800 Maintenance
                                   requirement: 2 × .25 = .50; 2,800 × .50 = 1,400
                               ■■ Long 100 XYZ ETF @ $50 (200% leverage) current market value: $5,000
                               ■■ Maintenance requirement: 2 × .25 = .50; $5,000 × .50 = $2,500
                               ■■ Short 100 shares DEF ETF @ $60 (300% leverage) market value: $6,000
                               ■■ Maintenance requirement: 3 × .30 = .90; $6,000 × .90 = $5,400

                               2. 8. 8. 1. 5 ETF Net Capital Haircuts

                                   An exchange-traded fund tracking high-capitalization, broad-based indexes, such as
                               SPDRs, is subject to a 10% haircut. ETFs tracking the riskier, non-high-capitalization, broad-
                               based and narrow-based or sector index, is subject to a 15% haircut against capital.

                               2. 8. 8. 1. 6 Exchange-Traded Notes (ETNs)

                                   Although similar in some regards, don’t confuse ETFs with ETNs, which are a type of
                               exchange-traded debt security offering a return linked to a market index or other benchmark.
                               Unlike ETFs, they do not buy or hold the assets replicating the performance of the underlying
                               index. Some of the indexes and investment strategies used by ETNs can be sophisticated and
                               very complex, carrying many different risks. They should be offered only to people who are
                               knowledgeable and comfortable with the risks. Those risks, in part, include:
                               ■■ credit risk (ETNs are unsecured debt obligations);
                               ■■ market risk;
                               ■■ liquidity risk (although exchange traded, a trading market may not develop);
                               ■■ call, early redemption, and acceleration risk (ETNs may be called at the issuer’s discre-
                                   tion); and
                               ■■ conflicts of interest (the issuer may engage in trading activities that are at odds with note
                                   holders [shorting, for instance]).

                  2. 9. 1      PROTECTION OF CUSTOMERS
                                    If the SEC or any SRO finds indications that a broker-dealer is in financial difficulty (usu-
                               ally this will entail net capital violations), SIPC will be notified immediately. If SIPC deter-
                               mines that the member has failed or is in imminent danger of failing, it may petition a federal
                               court to take action by appointing a trustee to liquidate the firm and protect its customers. A
                               customer can be broadly defined as anyone who has cash or securities in the possession of a
                               broker-dealer.
                                    The court, upon receipt of SIPC’s petition, issues a protective decree if the broker-dealer
                               is, in fact, insolvent and then promptly appoints a trustee for the liquidation of the broker-
                               dealer’s business.
                                    Once a trustee has been appointed, the member firm is prohibited from engaging in busi-
                               ness as a broker-dealer. It also is prohibited from attempting to conceal assets, file false state-
                               ments, or alter securities records to defraud the trustee or SIPC.


                  2. 9. 2      ACCOUNT TRANSFER
                                   If the trustee determines it is in the best interest of customers to do so, it may transfer
                               customer accounts directly to another member. If the failed firm is an introducing firm, the
                               accounts automatically become accounts of the clearing firm, which is holding customer assets
                               anyway.



                  2. 9. 3      CUSTOMER ACCOUNT COVERAGE
                                   The basic coverage under SIPC is up to $500,000 per separate customer, not per separate
                               account. Of that total, SIPC covers no more than $250,000 in unrecovered cash.



                  2. 9. 4      CORPORATE AND PARTNERSHIP ACCOUNTS
                                   Each corporate and partnership account is entitled to separate customer status—separate
                               from the accounts of its directors, partners, and owners.


                  2. 9. 5      CASH AND MARGIN ACCOUNTS
                                    If a customer has both a cash and a margin account, these accounts would be combined
                               for coverage purposes.
                                    The following claims are not permitted under SIPC:
                               ■■ Claims of officers or partners of the failed firm
                               ■■ Claims of other member firms for proprietary accounts
                               ■■ Claims of subordinated lenders (their funds are at risk)
                               ■■ Claims of persons who own 5% or more of the equity of the failed firm




Series_24_9e_Rev_LEM.indb 87                                                                                                            5/27/2015 7:38:12 AM

                                    In addition, SIPC does not cover losses relating to currencies or futures contracts, as these
                                are not securities. For amounts not covered in a SIPC liquidation, the customer becomes a
                                general (unsecured) creditor of the failed firm.
                                    There are customer accounts in which one person is related to each account, but each
                                account is considered a separate customer for SIPC coverage purposes.

                    EXAMPLE                               John has an individual account. Mary, his spouse, has an individual account, and
                                                      John and Mary have a joint account. Though John and Mary are related to each of
                                                      the accounts, each account is considered a separate customer for purposes of SIPC,
                                                      and each is covered for up to $500,000.



       2. 9. 6                  EXCESS COVERAGE
                                    It is not uncommon for members to provide, through private insurance companies, cover-
                                age in excess of SIPC limits. If the member decided to reduce or eliminate the excess coverage,
                                the member must advise its customers at least 30 days before the discontinuation or reduction
                                of such coverage.



            TEST TOPIC ALERT
                            !                             There are two key points regarding SIPC coverage. First, accounts are valued, for
                                                      coverage purposes, as of the filing date; this is the date on which an application for a
                                                      protective decree is filed, not the date the customer actually files his claim form. Sec-
                                                      ond, it is the equity in a margin account, not the long market value, which is used to
                                                      determine coverage. For example, an account with a long market value of $700,000,
                                                      a debit balance of $350,000, and equity of $350,000 would be covered for the entire
                                                      equity.



       2. 9. 7                  ADVERTISING SIPC MEMBERSHIP
                                    All firms that are SIPC members must place a sign in each office location indicating SIPC
                                membership, and all advertising by a member must include the SIPC logo or a statement of
                                SIPC membership.
                                    All members, unless they are excluded from membership in SIPC, are required to advise
                                all new customers that they may obtain information about SIPC, including the SIPC bro-
                                chure, by contacting SIPC. Members also must provide SIPC’s website address and telephone
                                number. Further, members must provide this information to new customers, in writing, at the
                                opening of an account, and must provide customers with the same information, in writing, at

                  2. 10            INSIDER TRADING REGULATIONS
                                           Insiders are officers, directors, as well as any person or entity that beneficially owns more
                                       than 10% of a company’s voting shares. In addition to monthly reporting of changes in owner-
                                       ship, insiders are prohibited from doing the following:
                                       ■■ Selling short their own company’s stock—however, they are permitted to sell short against
                                           the box at year-end to lock in a gain (and defer taxation) as long as the position is closed
                                           out within 20 days
                                       ■■ Taking short swing profits—a short swing profit is a profit realized, in a six-month period
                                           or shorter, from trading their own company’s stock; any short swing profit must be dis-
                                           gorged (returned to the company)
                                       ■■ Trading based on inside information (generally defined as nonpublic information which,
                                           if known, could reasonably be expected to affect the market price of a security)

                                          For purposes of insider trading, the definition of insider has been expanded to include
                                       anyone who has access to material, nonpublic information.


                  2. 10. 1 INSIDER TRADING AND SECURITIES FRAUD
                           ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 1988
                                            Trading securities on the basis of material nonpublic information is a violation of the law.
                                       The Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988 formally expanded the
                                       definition of an insider and established penalties for the illegal use of nonpublic information.
                                       Insiders may be held liable for more than just transactions in their own accounts.
                                            The act recognizes the fiduciary responsibility of the insider to the issuer, to the stockhold-
                                       ers, and to others who might be affected by trades made with insider knowledge. Investors
                                       who have suffered monetary damage because of insider trading have legal recourse against the
                                       insider and against any other party who had control over the misuse of nonpublic information.
                                            Inside information is any information that has not been widely disseminated to, or is not
                                       readily available to, the general public. To determine whether information is nonpublic, the
                                       SEC considers the method by which information is released to the public and the timing of
                                       trades relative to when the information is available for public evaluation. A tipper is one who
                                       gives inside information, and a tippee is the recipient of inside information.

                                                             Simply giving someone inside information, while imprudent, is not a violation of
                                                        law. When the information is used to trade for profit or to avoid a loss, a violation oc-
                                                        curs. In this event, both tipper and tippee are liable.

                                          The key elements of insider liability under the insider trading rules follow.
                                       ■■ Does the tipper owe a fiduciary duty to the company, its stockholders, and so forth, and has
                                          this duty been compromised?
                                       ■■ Does the tipper meet the personal benefits test (even something as simple as enhancing a
                                          friendship or reputation)?
                                       ■■ Does the tippee know or should the tippee have known that the information was inside
                                          or confidential?
                                       ■■ Is the information material and nonpublic?

                                   Given these elements, a misstatement by a corporate insider could leave that person liable
                                under the rules, and anyone who trades on that information could be liable as well.

                 CASE STUDY                           Using Inside Information

                                                           Situation: Mr. Thompson is a friend and neighbor of Mr. Cage, president and
                                                      owner of more than half of First Tech’s securities. Mr. Cage discloses to Mr. Thompson
                                                      that the company has just discovered a new technology that will double First Tech’s
                                                      earnings within the next year. No one outside of the company, except for Mr. Thomp-
                                                      son, knows of this discovery. On this basis, Mr. Thompson buys additional shares of
                                                      First Tech for Ms. Gordon.
                                                           Analysis: The information on First Tech’s new technology is material inside
                                                      information that has not been made public. It is material information that only
                                                      Mr. Thompson and company officials know. Mr. Thompson violated the Insider Trad-
                                                      ing Act of 1988 by acting on this information. Mr. Thompson should have communi-
                                                      cated the possession of the information to his compliance officer and refrained from
                                                      making recommendations on the basis of this information.


       2. 10. 2 TRADE REVIEW AND INVESTIGATION
                                     As a result of the act, FINRA required member firms to establish written supervisory pro-
                                cedures reasonably designed to detect and prevent the misuse of inside information by persons
                                affiliated with members. Member firms erect information barriers, segregating the information
                                flow in departments that may have sensitive information (e.g., the investment banking depart-
                                ment) from the rest of the firm. Member firms must subject trades in NYSE-listed securities
                                effected for the account of the firm, or for the accounts of members or employees of the mem-
                                ber or member organization and their family members, including Rule 407 trades (employee of
                                member trades), to review procedures that are reasonably designed to identify trades that may
                                violate the Securities Exchange Act or the rules prohibiting insider trading and manipulative
                                and deceptive devices. In addition, firms must promptly conduct an internal investigation into
                                trades that appear to have violated those laws and rules to determine whether they did violate
                                those laws and rules.

       2. 10. 4 PENALTIES FOR TRADING ON INSIDE INFORMATION
                                    The SEC may seek civil penalties against anyone it believes has violated the Insider
                                Trading Act. The penalty for the controlled person who makes the trade can be up to three
                                times the profit made or loss avoided (i.e., treble damages). The controlling person (i.e., as the
                                name implies, someone like a member firm who controls the offender) can be fined $1 million
                                or three times the amount of profit made or loss avoided, whichever is greater if it knew (or
                                disregarded) that the controlled person (e.g., registered representative) was likely to violate
                                the law and took no steps to prevent it.
                                    In addition, willful criminal violations carry punishments up to $5 million and can send a
                                violator to prison for up to 20 years for each violation. However, prison time is waiting only for
                                those whose crime is willful. If a defendant can show that he had no knowledge of the inside
                                nature of the information, only fines would be levied. If the violator is employed by a broker-
                                dealer, which should have procedures in place to avoid this, the firm (i.e., the controlling
                                person) can be fined up to $25 million or treble damages, whichever is greater.
                                    When determining how much profit or loss was made or avoided, the SEC looks at the
                                security’s market price after the information becomes public. The difference between this price
                                and the price the trader obtained determines the profit or loss avoided.

                                                           Any fines levied for insider trading violations must be paid to the U.S. Treasury.



       2. 10. 5 CONTEMPORANEOUS TRADERS
                                    A lawsuit can be brought to court by anyone who, at the same time, bought (if the insider
                                sold) or sold (if the insider bought) securities of the same class. The action against those who
                                were in possession of material, nonpublic information and acted upon it, may be initiated
                                up to five years after the date of the last transaction that is the subject of the violation. The
                                total amount of damages imposed may not exceed the profit gained or loss avoided in the
                                transaction(s) that are the subject of the violation.
                                    The SEC, in its sole discretion, is permitted to pay bounties to informants in insider trad-
                                ing cases. The total amount of the bounty that may be paid from a civil penalty cannot exceed
                                10% of that penalty.


       2. 10. 6 MISAPPROPRIATION THEORY
                                    Those who steal information and make trades based on that ill-gotten intelligence are
                                deemed to be trading on inside information. For example, two capital markets people are
                                imprudently speaking about a merger on a crowded elevator. If a representative, who does not
                                know the people talking about the deal, exits the elevator and trades based on that new, mis-
                                appropriated intelligence, he could, if this trading activity were uncovered, go to jail.
                                    As soon as a representative hears this type of inside information, he should immediately
                                notify the manager who should caution the representative to not act on the information and
                                then escalate the incident to the firm’s compliance department. Under no condition is the
                                representative permitted to act on the information either for himself or the benefit of his cli-
                                ents. Even though his clients may have positions in their portfolios that could be substantially
                                impacted by the new information, he may not act upon it.

                  2. 11           FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY RULES


                  2. 11. 1 SEC UNIFORM NET CAPITAL RULE 15C3-1
                                         The uniform net capital rule is the SEC’s primary means of assuring that registered securi-
                                    ties broker-dealers have enough money (capitalization) to deal responsibly with the investing
                                    public. In theory, net capital is the amount of money left over after every liability of a broker-
                                    dealer has been satisfied. It is critically important that principals of all FINRA member firms
                                    grasp the importance of maintaining sufficient capital to minimize the possibility of financial
                                    failure and to protect customer assets if they do fail. In short, account for all liabilities. Disallow
                                    all illiquid assets, and ensure that all eligible securities positions receive an applicable haircut.

                               CASE STUDY                  Broker-dealers are required to accurately make a record of expenses incurred
                                                     relating to its business. From time to time, a broker-dealer may have in place an
                                                     expense sharing agreement with another company, most often an affiliated company.
                                                     For example, an expense agreement might state that for a flat monthly payment of
                                                     $20,000 from the broker-dealer to its parent company for “management and other
                                                     administrative expenses,” with no definition of what that actually means, a finan-
                                                     cial and operations principal at the broker-dealer may feel justified in not recording
                                                     utilities, rent, cable, telephone, et cetera, because management claims that all these
                                                     expenses are included in the monthly payment. The SEC’s Division of Market Regula-
                                                     tion (DMR) requires, in this case, that the actual expenses reduce the firm’s capital as
                                                     though there was no expense sharing agreement. Such an agreement must clearly
                                                     itemize the actual services provided to the broker-dealer with a reasonable cost appor-
                                                     tioned to each in order to avoid the reduction in capital. The burden of proof that the
                                                     third party is able to meet its obligations rests with the broker-dealer. The other party
                                                     must be able and willing to provide sufficient written evidence of its wherewithal.

                                        As you know, each member firm operates under an individualized membership agreement
                                    with FINRA (or other SRO). The membership agreement explains what lines of business
                                    the broker-dealer undertakes. Most firms choose to “introduce” their customers to another
                                    member firm known as a clearing or carrying firm to handle back office tasks, such as clearing
                                    trades, sending trade confirmations, settlement and reporting compliance, trade execution,
                                    and custody of customer funds and securities. An introducing firm may operate with more than
                                    one clearing firm. If, for example, a member firm executes trades on Canadian exchanges, it
                                    may wish to clear those trades through a firm that has Canadian experience and qualifications.
                                        Because carrying firms have custody of customer assets, they are required by law to main-
                                    tain higher levels of net capital than introducing firms. They also are responsible for segregat-
                                    ing the customer funds and securities in their custody. Because their risk profile is higher than
                                    an introducing firm, their net capital requirement is higher. Let’s review the varying amounts
                                    of net capital required of various types of member firms.

       2. 11. 2 CARRYING FIRMS
                                     A carrying firm carries customer accounts and accepts funds and securities from custom-
                                ers. These firms are very often self-clearing. A firm carrying customer funds and securities
                                clearly has a line of business that is inherently risky. The minimum net capital requirement for
                                carrying firms is $250,000 or 62/3% of aggregate indebtedness (AI), whichever is greater (AI is
                                discussed later in the Unit). Firms that do a commission recapture business also are required to
                                have that amount of net capital since they are deemed to carry customer funds.
                                     Carrying and clearing firms typically rank among the larger broker-dealers. Those firms
                                carrying more than $20 million in net capital must document their procedures for managing
                                risk and maintaining liquidity.


       2. 11. 3 INTRODUCING FIRMS (FULLY DISCLOSED FIRMS)
                                    A fully disclosed firm is one that introduces its customers to a clearing firm. The clearing
                                firm holds funds and securities of the introducing firm’s customers and performs related func-
                                tions, such as sending confirmations and statements for its correspondent firms. Essentially,
                                the clearing firm acts as the introducing firm’s back office. The minimum net capital require-
                                ment for introducing firms is either $5,000 or $50,000, depending on how their business is
                                conducted.

                                                          The two major differences are that a $50,000 introducing firm can receive (but
                                                      not hold) customer securities in-house for prompt forwarding to its clearing firm and
                                                      can participate in a firm commitment underwriting as a selling group member. A
                                                      $5,000 firm is not permitted to do either.

                                                          If a firm is, for whatever reason, unable to make a net capital computation
                                                      necessary to demonstrate that it is in compliance with the net capital rule, then it
                                                      would be deemed insolvent. An insolvent broker-dealer must cease all securities
                                                      operations.



                  2. 11. 4 DEALERS
                                           Introducing firms ($5,000 or $50,000) are permitted to make occasional trades in their
                                       firms’ investment accounts. For net capital purposes, the concept of a dealer is any member
                                       that:
                                       ■■ endorses (writes) over-the-counter options; or
                                       ■■ effects more than 10 transactions per year in its investment account.

                                           The minimum net capital requirement for a dealer is $100,000. This capital requirement
                                       only affects firms whose requirement is below $100,000 (e.g., introducing firms).

                                                      account, its minimum net capital requirement is $100,000, not $5,000 or $50,000.



                  2. 11. 5 MEMBER OFFERING MUTUAL FUND SHARES
                                           For members that deal solely in the sale of mutual funds or other investment company
                                       products, such as unit trusts or variable annuities, the minimum net capital requirement is
                                       either $5,000 or $25,000. For firms that accept wire orders from fund customers, the minimum
                                       is $25,000. For firms that sell on a subscription basis only, the minimum is $5,000. For firms
                                       that do both, the minimum is $25,000.

                                           For firms registered as market makers, the minimum net capital requirement is a function
                                       of the number of markets made, subject to a minimum of $100,000 and a maximum of $1 mil-
                                       lion. For each stock in which the firm makes a market, the requirements are:

                                                      making alone, minimum capital requirements can never exceed $1 million.

                                                      minimum would appear to be $50,000. However, based on its market-making status,
                                                      the minimum requirement is $100,000. These are never additive. Firm #4 has a mini-

                  2. 11. 7 BASIC NET CAPITAL COMPUTATION METHOD
                                   Net capital represents the liquid net worth of a firm as computed using generally accepted
                               accounting principles (GAAP). It differs from net worth in that net worth includes the value
                               of all of a member’s assets, including items deemed illiquid, such as goodwill exchange mem-
                               bership; and equipment, such as computers, copiers, software, and so on.
                                                             Net worth = total assets – total liabilities
                                   Net capital excludes the value of a member’s illiquid assets.
                                                            Net capital = liquid assets – total liabilities
                                   In theory, if a member goes into liquidation, the amount realized after all assets are sold
                               and all liabilities paid off is net capital.
                                   To find the total available capital, start with net worth and then add any subordinated
                               debt. If a subordinated loan has been approved by regulatory authorities, it can be added back
                               in the net capital computation. Subordinated loans are covered in greater detail later in the
                               unit.




Series_24_9e_Rev_LEM.indb 97                                                                                                             5/27/2015 7:38:12 AM

                                      At this point, the net capital computation is as follows:
                                                                                   Net worth
                                                                                 + Subordinated debt
                                                                                   Total available capital

                                    As you can see, subordinated debt receives favorable net capital treatment. Although you
                                will not be required to compute net capital, hopefully, the illustration will help map the con-
                                cept and terms in your mind.


       2. 11. 8 NONALLOWABLE ASSETS
                                    The next step is to reduce total available capital by the amount of the firm’s illiquid (non-
                                allowable) assets.




                     *
                    EXAMPLE                                Nonallowable assets include equity in real estate, exchange memberships, furni-
                                                      ture and fixtures, goodwill, prepaid expenses, and other assets that cannot readily be
                                                      sold for fair value.

                                      After deducting all nonallowable assets, the computation is as follows:
                                                                                   Net worth
                                                                                 + Subordinated debt
                                                                                   Total available capital
                                                                                 – Nonallowable assets
                                                                                   Tentative net capital


       2. 11. 9 HAIRCUTS
                                    The final step is to take haircuts (value reductions) on the firm’s inventory of securities
                                (securities owned by the firm). After taking haircuts, the computation is complete:
                                                                                   Net worth
                                                                                 + Subordinated debt
                                                                                   Total available capital
                                                                                 – Nonallowable assets
                                                                                   Tentative net capital
                                                                                 – Haircuts
                                                                                   Net capital

                                    The standard haircut on actively traded common stock is 15%. If stock owned by the firm
                                has a limited trading market, the haircut is 40%. A limited trading market is where there are
                                only one or two independent (that excludes the computing member) market makers submit-

                                   ting regular quotations in an interdealer quotation system for the securities. In that case, the
                                   haircut is 40% on both the long and short positions. In cases where there are three or more
                                   independent market makers submitting regular quotations, the haircut is the same as for com-
                                   mon stock (15%). A stock with a limited trading market is sometimes referred to as thinly
                                   traded. By contrast, a well-known stock like Apple, Inc. has over 50 market makers.
                                       For stocks in which there is no ready market, or your firm is the only market maker,
                                   the haircut is 100%. Examples would include unregistered warrants and unregistered stock.
                                   Essentially, these securities are nonallowable assets. Remember, the principal idea behind net
                                   capital is how much money would be available after everything is promptly liquidated. So,
                                   even though your accountancy staff might apply a value of $1 million, for example, on certain
                                   securities, if there’s no way to unload those securities, then a haircut of 100% is applied for net
                                   capital purposes.

                                        An additional haircut generally is required to be taken on a particular security if its value
                                   is too great relative to the firm’s tentative net capital (the firm has too many eggs in one bas-
                                   ket). If the value of any single nonexempt security exceeds 10% of tentative net capital, the
                                   firm must take an additional haircut at the same rate on the amount by which the position
                                   exceeds the 10% threshold. An exception to this additional haircut requirement is for U.S.
                                   government securities.

                               EXAMPLE                  A firm has tentative net capital of $600,000 and the following inventory posi-
                                                   tions:

                                                                      $75,000 ABC stock
                                                                      $80,000 US Treasury bonds
                                                                      $50,000 XYZ stock
                                                                      $55,000 DEF stock

                                                       The only position in inventory subject to an undue concentration haircut is ABC
                                                   stock (more than 10% of $600,000).
                                                       US Treasury securities are an exempt security, and therefore, are never subject to
                                                   an additional haircut, no matter how large the position.

                  2. 11. 11 AGED FAILS TO DELIVER
                                       A customer fail to deliver can arise when a customer sells stock and fails to deliver the
                                   securities by the settlement date. At that point, the member sets up on its books a fail to deliver
                                   in the amount of the sales proceeds. It is an allowable asset for capital purposes. However, the
                                   longer it remains, the greater the risk to the member.
                                       On the fifth business day after settlement, the fail to deliver must be aged for capital com-
                                   putation purposes. The position is marked to the market, and a 15% haircut is taken on its

                                aged, it is still an allowable asset.


       2. 11. 12 JOINT BACK OFFICE ARRANGEMENTS
                                    With prior written notification to FINRA, two or more broker-dealers that wish to obtain
                                special margin treatment pursuant to Regulation T may form a joint back office (JBO) arrange-
                                ment for carrying and clearing accounts. Carrying and/or clearing members in a JBO arrange-
                                ment must maintain a minimum tentative net capital of $25 million.


       2. 11. 13 ALTERNATIVE NET CAPITAL METHOD
                                    For members that elect to compute their net capital under the alternative standard, the
                                minimum net capital requirement is $250,000, or 2% of debits in the reserve computation,
                                whichever is greater. For those firms electing the alternative standard, early warning occurs
                                when net capital is less than 5% of aggregate debit items computed using the reserve computa-
                                tion. The reserve computation will be discussed later in this Unit.


       2. 11. 14 GUARANTEES BY MEMBERS
                                    Whenever a member firm guarantees the obligations or liabilities of another person, writ-
                                ten notice to FINRA must be made at least 10 business days prior to entering the arrangement.


       2. 11. 15 AGGREGATE INDEBTEDNESS (AI)
                                   Aggregate indebtedness (AI) represents certain liabilities of a member firm. It is not
                                important to know which balance sheet liabilities are AI and which are not. It is important,
                                however, to identify and assess the ratio relationship between net capital and AI, as shown:
                                                                               AI       Net Capital
                                                           Established firm   $15           $1        = 15:1
                                                           First-year firm    $ 8           $1        =   8:1


                                    For established firms, the ratio of AI to net capital cannot exceed 15:1 (for every dollar the
                                firm has in computed net capital, it cannot have more that $15 in aggregate indebtedness). For
                                firms in their first year of operation, the ratio cannot exceed 8:1. An alternative way of seeing
                                the 15:1 AI:NC ratio for a clearing firm on the exam would be $250,000 or 62/3% of aggregate
                                indebtedness, whichever is greater.

                    EXAMPLE                             An established carrying firm has computed net capital of $600,000. The maxi-
                                                   mum amount of AI this firm could have would be $9 million (15 × $600,000). If
                                                   this were a first-year firm, the maximum AI amount would be $4.8 million (8 ×
                                                   $600,000).

                  2. 11. 16 EFFECT ON NET CAPITAL
                                        The effect of the AI rule is to increase a firm’s minimum net capital requirement as aggre-
                                    gate indebtedness rises.




                                *
                                EXAMPLE                  An established carrying firm has AI of $12 million. Its minimum net capital
                                                    requirement is $800,000, which is computed by dividing $12 million by 15. Alterna-
                                                    tively, $12 million x 6 2/3% ($12,000,000 x .06666).

                                         To restate, the minimum net capital requirement for an established carrying firm is
                                    $250,000 or 1/15 of AI, whichever is greater. Therefore, as a firm expands, increasing its AI,
                                    its capital requirement increases to compensate for the additional risk.


                  2. 11. 17 SUBORDINATION AGREEMENTS
                                        Subordinated loans, if approved by the regulatory authorities, can be added to net worth
                                    in computing net capital (i.e., approved subordinated debt is considered capital).
                                        Subordinated loans are certain loans to a member for which the lender agrees to subordi-
                                    nate its claim to the claims of the member’s other creditors. Subordinated loans are typically
                                    long term in nature and are a major source of financing for many firms.
                                        Subordination agreements are of two types: (1) subordinated loan agreements, and (2)
                                    secured demand note agreements.
                                    ■■ In a subordinated loan agreement the lender gives the member cash in exchange for inter-
                                        est payments on the loan and repayment at some future date.
                                    ■■ In a secured demand note agreement, the lender gives the member negotiable securities
                                        to pledge on its own behalf to a bank for a loan. The lender receives interest at an agreed-
                                        upon rate, all dividends on the pledged stock, and repayment at an agreed-upon date.
                                        Typically, common stock is pledged. The member then takes these marginable securities to
                                    a bank for a loan. As a general rule, the bank will loan 70% of the value of the securities to the
                                    firm. If the value of the stock is $100,000, the bank will loan $70,000 to the firm. The result is
                                    an increase in the firm’s capital of $70,000.
                                        Another way to look at this is that the haircut on securities underlying a secured demand
                                    note is 30%.


                        2. 11. 17. 1 Standards For Subordinated Loans
                                       Subordination agreements are required to have the following features:
                                    ■■ A minimum term of one year
                                    ■■ In written form, valid and binding on all parties
                                    ■■ For a specific amount
                                    ■■ Lender’s claims must be subordinated to all other claims
                                    ■■ Proceeds of the loan must be used in the business and are subject to the risks of the busi-

                                    When a member has a secured demand note agreement, the following additional rules
                                apply.
                                ■■ Only fully paid securities can be pledged, and such securities must be in street name, bearer
                                    form, or in the name of the member. They cannot be subject to any restrictions regarding
                                    sale or transfer. Unregistered securities or securities subject to a Rule 144 filing are not
                                    acceptable collateral.
                                ■■ The agreement must be for a specific amount; the amount cannot vary with the value of
                                    the underlying collateral.
                                ■■ If the value of the underlying collateral declines sharply (below that of the loan amount),
                                    immediately notify FINRA.


             2. 11. 17. 2 Temporary Subordinated Loans
                                     Temporary subordinated loans are for short-term needs and are normally used in conjunc-
                                tion with firm commitment underwritings. SEC rules require that member firms, when acting
                                as a syndicate member in a firm commitment offering, haircut that commitment as of the close
                                of business on the day before the effective date.




                     *
                    EXAMPLE                             A firm has a 10% syndicate participation in a $60 million initial public offering of
                                                   common stock. It is committed to purchasing $6 million of the stock for resale to the
                                                   public. Even if the issue is presold (there are more indications of interest than shares
                                                   to be sold), this firm is required to charge its net capital by $1.8 million (30% × $6
                                                   million).
                                                        The haircut on IPOs is 30%, while that on additional issue offerings is 15%. The
                                                   haircut of $1.8 million can be reduced by the estimated profit to be made on the sale.

                                    Nonetheless, this is a significant reduction in capital. To offset the charge, a firm can take
                                on temporary subordinated debt. The firm does not need the money; it needs something to
                                restore capital reduced as a result of the haircut. Member firms are permitted no more than
                                three temporary subordinated loans in any 12-month period. The maximum duration of such
                                loans is 45 days.


             2. 11. 17. 3 Filing Of Subordination Agreements
                                     File two copies of proposed subordinated loan agreements with FINRA at least 10 days
                                before the anticipated effective date. FINRA then renders a written opinion as to whether
                                these loans are approved for capital purposes.
                                     Repayment of a subordinated loan at maturity is suspended if, after repayment, its
                                AI-to-NC ratio exceeds 12:1 or if its net capital is less than 120% of its minimum requirement
                                (5% of aggregate debit items using the alternative standard).
                                     Prepayment of a subordinated loan is permitted as long as the agreement has been in force
                                for at least one year and the prepayment will not cause its AI-to-NC ratio to exceed 10:1 or its
                                net capital to fall below 120% of its minimum requirement. Further, prepayment requires prior

       2. 11. 18 DEBT/EQUITY RATIO
                                    The debt/equity ratio of a member firm is a capital ratio. It has nothing to do with con-
                                ventional liabilities. It expresses the percentage of a member’s total available capital that is
                                accounted for by subordinated debt.




                     *
                    EXAMPLE                             A firm has a net worth of $600,000 and subordinated loans of $200,000.


                                                                              Net worth

                                                                              Total available capital
                                                                                                         $600,000
                                                                                                         $200,000

                                                        Its debt/equity ratio is 25% ($200,000 ÷ $800,00). Conversely, 75% of its total
                                                   available capital comes from real equity.

                  2. 12         FINANCIAL REPORTING


                  2. 12. 1 SEC RULE 17A-5
                                     Member firms must file electronic FOCUS reports with the regulatory authorities. These
                                 reports show the financial condition of the member, include a net capital computation, and
                                 provide related operational information.
                                     SEC Rule 17a-5 requires, among other things, that broker-dealers file monthly FOCUS
                                 Reports, Part II, and quarterly FOCUS Reports, Part II or IIA, within 17 business days after
                                 the end of the month or quarter. Carrying firms must file FOCUS II reports both monthly
                                 and quarterly. The quarterly FOCUS II report is more extensive than that filed monthly.
                                 Noncarrying firms must file FOCUS IIA quarterly unless FINRA notifies the firm in writing
                                 that it must file monthly. A fifth FOCUS report is an additional report that is due from those
                                 member firms whose fiscal year end is other than the calendar quarter.
                                     Furthermore, the SEC rules require firms to file Schedule I, which deals with operational
                                 matters, within 17 business days after the end of the calendar year. FOCUS Reports, as well
                                 as Schedule I, must be filed electronically with FINRA no later than midnight ET on the due
                                 date.
                                     Quarterly FOCUS reports are based on calendar quarter reporting. If a member’s year-end
                                 date does not coincide with the end of calendar quarter, its quarters are not calendar quarters.
                                 In this case, the firm must file a fifth quarterly FOCUS report within 17 business days of year-
                                 end date.
                                     If a firm terminates its membership in any national securities exchange or withdraws from
                                 any self-regulatory organization, it must file a FOCUS II or IIA within two business days of
                                 termination.


                        2. 12. 1. 1 Supplemental FOCUS Information (FINRA Rule 4524)
                                     A supplementary schedule under FINRA Rule 4524, known as the SSOI, contains addi-
                                 tional line items for more details of the revenue and expense line items that are on the state-
                                 ment of income (loss) page of the FOCUS Report Part II and Part IIA. The SSOI helps
                                 FINRA better deduce a firm’s revenue sources and expense composition on an ongoing basis.
                                 Each firm, as FINRA designates, is required to file the Form SSOI within 20 business days of
                                 the end of each calendar quarter.
                                     Firms with a $100,000 minimum net capital requirement or more and that carry inven-
                                 tory positions (other than money market mutual funds) must file a Supplemental Inventory
                                 Schedule (SIS) within 20 business days of filing its FOCUS reporting period. Just like the
                                 FOCUS, it must be filed using the eFOCUS System through FINRA’s Firm Gateway.
                                     If the term FOGS Report appears on the test, know that it is the same thing as a FOCUS
                                 report, but used by government securities brokers and dealers.


                        2. 12. 1. 2 Form Custody
                                     The SEC has recently added to Rule 17a-5 a requirement to file “Form Custody” with the
                                 view to discover whether a broker-dealer maintains custody of customer and non-customer
                                 assets and, if so, how the assets are maintained. Form Custody must be filed quarterly, within
                                 17 business days of the quarter’s end. If the broker-dealer’s fiscal year is not the same as the
                                 calendar year, the firm must also file an additional Form Custody 17 business days after its fis-
                                 cal year end.

                                                   file, for each noncalendar quarter-ending month, an abbreviated FOCUS IIA within 17
                                                   business days of month end.



       2. 12. 2 AUDITED REPORTS
                                     All broker-dealers registered with the SEC are required to file audited FOCUS II or IIA
                                reports within 60 days of year-end date with a FOCUS Part III facing page. If a firm needs an
                                extension to file its audited financials, the request must be directed to the firm’s designated
                                examining authority (e.g., FINRA). Similarly, if a firm wants to change its year-end date, this
                                request also must be made to the firm’s designated examining authority, as well as the SEC in
                                Washington and regional offices, along with an explanation as to why. The DEA then has to
                                approve the request.
                                     The annual audit report must be filed in hard copy as follows: two copies with the principal
                                office of the SEC, one copy with the appropriate regional office of the SEC, and one copy with
                                the principal office of FINRA.
                                     A firm seeking an extension to file its audited report may seek a date not to exceed 90 days
                                from year-end date. The maximum extension is 30 days. Requests for an extension of time
                                must be received by FINRA at least three business days before the due date.


       2. 12. 3 STATEMENTS TO CUSTOMERS
                                    Carrying firms are required to provide their customers with a semiannual statement (an
                                unaudited balance sheet and unaudited statement of net capital) and an annual statement (an
                                audited balance sheet and an audited statement of net capital). Upon request, all firms must
                                provide customers with a balance sheet.


       2. 12. 4 TRIAL BALANCES
                                     A trial balance is a report, taken from a firm’s general ledger, that includes the firm’s bal-
                                ance sheet, income statement, and net worth accounts. From the information in the trial bal-
                                ance, a firm can prepare a net capital computation. SEC rules require that members prepare
                                trial balances at least monthly.


       2. 12. 5 TERMINATION OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANT
                                    If a member’s independent accountant resigns or is fired, the member must electronically
                                notify SEC and FINRA within 15 business days of termination date. The notice must include:
                                ■■ details surrounding the termination;
                                ■■ information on any accounting or auditing disputes; and
                                ■■ a letter from the former accountant presenting the other side.

                                        SEC Rule 17a-11 requires that reports be made electronically to the SEC and FINRA if a
                                    member has violated the net capital rule, is close to violating the net capital rule, or is expe-
                                    riencing operational problems.
                                        There are six situations that require notification under 17a-11.
                                    1. The firm’s net capital falls below its minimum requirement.
                                    2. The firm’s AI-to-NC ratio exceeds 15:1 (8:1 for a first-year member).
                                    3. The firm’s debt/equity ratio exceeds 70% for more than 90 days.
                                    4. The firm’s books and records are not current.
                                    5. The firm has material inadequacies in its accounting system.
                                    6.	The firm has a total amount of money payable against all securities loaned or subject to
                                        a repurchase agreement, or the total contract value of all securities borrowed or subject
                                        to a reverse repurchase agreement, exceeds tentative net capital by 25 times (2,500%).
                                        Government securities are excluded from the calculation.

                                        Situations 1 and 2 are essentially the same. If a firm’s AI-to-NC ratio exceeds 15:1, its
                                    capital is below minimum.
                                        If a firm is reporting 1, 2, 3, or 4, notification must be made immediately. If the member is
                                    reporting 5, notification must be made within 24 hours.
                                        If a member is reporting that its computed capital is below its minimum requirement, the
                                    member, in its notification, must state both its minimum requirement and the amount of its
                                    computed net capital.
                                        In addition, if a member is reporting either 4 or 5, it also must file a report within 48 hours
                                    of notification, detailing the steps being taken to correct the situation.


                  2. 13. 1 EARLY WARNING REPORTS
                                       A member is in early warning if:
                                    ■■ its capital falls below 120% of its minimum requirement; or
                                    ■■ its AI-to-NC ratio exceeds 12:1.




                                *
                                EXAMPLE                 An established carrying firm, subject to a $250,000 minimum net capital require-
                                                    ment, would be in early warning if its computed net capital fell below $300,000
                                                    (120% × $250,000).
                                                         Early warning reports must be made within 24 hours. For first-year firms, there
                                                    is no early warning standard regarding AI-to-NC ratios, because FINRA is already
                                                    watching first-year firms closely.

       2. 14            REPORTING AND INQUIRY—LOST, STOLEN, MISSING
                        SECURITIES
                                     SEC Rule 17f-1 calls for the SEC or its designee, currently the Securities Information
                                Center (SIC), to maintain records of lost, counterfeit, missing, or stolen securities. This rule
                                was created in an effort to reduce trafficking in lost, stolen, missing, and counterfeit securities.
                                The database of securities maintained by the SIC can only be accessed by registered BDs and
                                other financial institutions to ascertain if securities that have come into their possession have
                                been reported as lost, stolen, missing, or counterfeit.
                                     Upon discovery of the likely loss of a security, if no criminal action is suspected, a member
                                has two business days to locate the missing security. If it is still missing on the third day, the
                                loss must be reported to the SIC and the transfer agent.
                                     If securities are missing and criminal action is suspected, a member has one business day
                                to report the loss to the SIC and the transfer agent. In addition, the FBI must be notified
                                promptly. If the securities are later recovered, those parties who were originally notified must
                                be advised of the recovery within one business day. Only the party reporting the loss can make
                                notification of the recovery.
                                     Every member is required to inquire of the SIC regarding certain securities coming into its
                                possession as to whether the security has been reported as lost, missing, counterfeit or stolen.
                                     Exceptions are made to this inquiry rule if the security is:
                                ■■ received directly from the issuer;
                                ■■ received from another reporting institution (e.g., member firm);
                                ■■ received from an existing customer of the firm and registered in the customer’s name, or
                                     was previously sold to that customer as verified by the member’s records; and
                                ■■ part of a transaction valued at $10,000 or less.

                                    However, any member may inquire at any time as to the validity of any security delivered
                                into the firm. In essence, the rule requires inquiry only if securities are received from a new
                                customer in registered or bearer form, or from an existing customer in bearer form in which the
                                record of the purchase is not available.
                                    Broker-dealers that carry securities are required to make a count quarterly. If securities are
                                discovered missing as the result of a quarterly securities count, the member has 10 business
                                days to report to the SIC.



       2. 15            RECORDKEEPING AND RETENTION OF BOOKS AND
                        RECORDS
                                    The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires that broker-dealers make and keep records
                                in order for the Commission, SROs and state regulators to conduct meaningful and effective
                                examinations. The integrity of a firm’s books and records are of paramount importance. Firms
                                must store true, legible and accurate records and protect them. Any falsification, alteration
                                (no matter how small) or destruction of books and records is a serious violation. When this
                                sort of behavior is uncovered, it always leads to heavy sanctions.

                  2. 15. 1 SEC RULES 17A-3 AND 17A-4 (FINRA RULE 4511)
                                             These rules cover which records must be prepared by members, when such records must
                                        be prepared, in what format they must be kept, and for how long records must be retained.
                                        As required under these rules and Rule 3110, each member firm is responsible for developing
                                        and maintaining policies, procedures, and controls relating to the creation and retention of
                                        its books and records and update them as often as necessary. (Firm policies and procedures
                                        cannot be updated too much. However, a record of each iteration must be maintained.) An
                                        example of a firm-specific issue is instant messaging. If a firm uses that form of communication,
                                        how will it capture and retain a record of those messages? Another example might include the
                                        firm’s policies on scanning devices and their proper use. If a representative scans new account
                                        forms and he destroys the originals, and the scanned images are later found to be inaccessible
                                        or for some reason unreadable, the firm will be in violation. There is a ripple effect to this. If
                                        the new accounts department needed the records, they may not be able to verify and process
                                        the customer’s account, thus creating not only a compliance risk but a business risk as well. A
                                        supervisor then has the responsibility to find out how this happened as soon as it is uncovered
                                        and the extent of the problem. The representative should be re-trained and closely supervised.
                                        In addition, the representative should obtain the new account paperwork—again.
                                             Recordkeeping policies and procedures vary from firm to firm. Each firm must develop its
                                        own WSPs to be in compliance with the rules and to fit its unique circumstances.
                                             For retention purposes, records are generally lifetime records, six-year records, or three-year
                                        records. That said, be on the lookout for variances, such as the four-year retention requirement
                                        for customer written complaints. When FINRA examiners ask for the most recent two years’
                                        worth of records, they must be readily available.

                                                              In lieu of maintaining paper records, firms may wish to use micrographic media,
                                                         such as microfilm or microfiche (so long as there is a reading device available) or elec-
                                                         tronic storage media, such as DVDs. Such media must have the capability to maintain
                                                         records in non-rewriteable and non-erasable format. A broker-dealer is obligated to
                                                         notify FINRA at least 90 days prior to utilizing electronic storage for recordkeeping
                                                         purposes.

                                                              There are various recordkeeping rules imposed by different regulatory bodies. For
                                                         example, those broker-dealers that are subject to reporting and recordkeeping of cur-

                                                         there is a differing recordkeeping requirement, the SEC’s view is to preserve the record

             2. 15. 1. 2 Six-Year Records
                                    This list points to records that must be retained for six years. FINRA Rule 4511 also
                                prescribes that where no specific retention period is mentioned in any rule or law, the default
                                retention period is six years. Furthermore, if the books and records pertain to an account, the
                                records must be maintained for six years after the date the account is closed.

                                    Blotters. A blotter is a record of original entry. A member generally maintains blotters
                                relating to the purchase and sale of securities, the receipt and delivery of securities, and the
                                receipt and disbursement of cash. Blotters must reflect transactions as of trade date (or event
                                date) and must be prepared no later than the following business day.

                                    General Ledger. The general ledger contains accounting records of the firm’s assets,
                                liabilities, and net worth accounts. From the general ledger, a firm prepares its financial
                                statements. The general ledger must be prepared as frequently as necessary to determine
                                compliance with the net capital rule, but in no event less frequently than monthly.

                                    Stock Record. The stock record shows all securities held by the firm, the ownership of
                                those securities, and where the securities are held. The stock record must be posted no later
                                than the business day after settlement date.

                                    Customer Ledgers. Customer ledgers are customer statements. Cash accounts and
                                margin accounts are shown on separate ledgers. These ledgers must be posted no later than
                                settlement date.

                                    Customer Account Records. Customer account records are records that every mem-
                                ber broker-dealer must preserve for not less than six years after the closing of any customer’s
                                account and any records of the terms and conditions with respect to the opening and main-
                                tenance of the account. Note that if there has been a report generated on this account due
                                to unusual activity, all of these reports in customer accounts must be retained for 18 months
                                after the report was generated. Customer account records might include the new account

                                             Exception reports ordered from a clearing firm must be retained for 18 months. These
                                        reports can be generated daily to review for unusual activity in customer accounts. The list
                                        of available exception reports available from a clearing firm is extensive. These reports are
                                        invaluable and can provide excellent supervision tools to help spot most any kind of irregu-
                                        larity in customer and proprietary accounts, such as high turnover rates, large debit balances,

       2. 16            CUSTOMER PROTECTION RULE (SEC RULE 15c3-3)
                                    SEC Rule 15c3-3, the Customer Protection Rule, was enacted in conjunction with SIPC
                                legislation in response to a wave of broker-dealer liquidations in the late 1960s and early
                                1970s. The rule has two basic components: (1) possession or control requirements, and (2) the
                                reserve requirement.
                                    Carrying firms have the daily requirement to bring under possession (in-house) or control
                                (in an account controlled by the firm), all fully paid-for customer securities and all excess mar-
                                gin securities. Each day, from the prior day’s settlement records, a carrying firm must take steps
                                to ensure that it has obtained physical possession or control over such securities. For example,
                                securities due from customers to complete sell orders must be bought in promptly after 10 busi-
                                ness days from settlement.

                                                        Margin securities are not subject to this requirement. The securities are at a bank
                                                   collateralizing customer debit balances. Excess margin securities, however, must be
                                                   under the possession or control of the firm and may not be used as collateral.

                                      Good control locations include securities depositories, such as Depository Trust Company
                                (DTC), commercial banks, and other broker-dealers. DTC is the world’s largest securities
                                depository. It provides custody services for virtually all securities except those subject to trans-
                                fer or ownership restrictions. Securities eligible for DTC services are said to be on the approved
                                list. Foreign depositories, foreign clearing agencies, and foreign custodian banks are acceptable
                                control locations if approved by the SEC.

                                                        Credit unions and savings and loans are not good control locations.



       2. 16. 1 RESERVE REQUIREMENT
                                   Each week, as of the close of business on Friday (or on Monday for Friday), carrying firms
                                make the following determinations:
                                ■■ Monies owed to the member by customers (debits)
                                ■■ Monies owed by the member to customers (credits)

                                    If credits exceed debits, the firm, in theory, is using customer monies in the conduct of
                                business. The rule requires that any excess of credits over debits must be deposited in a Special
                                Reserve Bank Account for the Exclusive Benefit of Customers within one hour after the banks
                                open on the second business day following computation (this generally means by 10:00 am,
                                Tuesday). The only acceptable deposits into this account are cash and qualified securities;
                                that is, those securities backed by the full faith and credit of the US government, such as
                                Treasury bills, Treasury notes, Treasury bonds, and Ginnie Mae mortgage-backed securities.
                                    Failure to make a required deposit into a special reserve account requires immediate elec-
                                tronic notice to the SEC and FINRA. The member must promptly confirm the contents of the
                                electronic notice in writing.

                        2. 16. 1. 1 Special Reserve Account
                                    In opening a special reserve account, a member must inform the bank that the monies on
                                deposit are for the exclusive benefit of the member’s customers and that there can be no cross
                                liens on this account (the bank cannot go after funds in this account if the member is delin-
                                quent in meeting other obligations it may have with the bank).
                                    A member is permitted to withdraw monies from the special reserve account as long as the
                                withdrawal is supported by a computation indicating there is an excess on deposit.

                                2. 16. 1. 1. 1 Monthly Computation

                                    A firm that has customer credits of not more than $1 million and its AI:NC ratio does
                                not exceed 8:1 is permitted by the SEC to make the reserve computation monthly rather than
                                weekly. Because the updates are not as frequent, these firms must deposit into the account
                                105% of the required amount. For example, if the computation proved that the firm needed to
                                deposit $10,000, it would be required to deposit $10,500 instead.

                                     Certain firms are exempt from the computation requirements of the Customer Protection
                                Rule SEC Rule 15c3-3. These exemptions, which are available to noncarrying firms, are as
                                follows:
                                ■■ The k(1) exemption applies to firms whose transactions are limited to the sale and
                                     redemptions of redeemable securities of registered investment companies, and it promptly
                                     transmits all funds and delivers all securities received.
                                ■■ The k(2)(i) exemption is available to firms that carry no margin accounts and promptly
                                     forward all customer funds and securities. In other words, they do not hold funds or secu-
                                     rities for, or owe money or securities to, customers and conduct all financial transactions
                                     with customers through a bank account designated as “Special Account for the Exclusive
                                     Benefit of Customers.”
                                          This exemption often applies to firms that clear their business in an omnibus account.
                                     These firms engage a clearing firm to hold all of their customer securities in an omnibus
                                     (umbrella) account. The clearing firm does not know the identity of the beneficial owners
                                     of the stock. All the securities are held in the firm’s name. The member firm clearing this
                                     way (unlike an introducing firm) is responsible for sending statements and confirmations
                                     and maintaining ownership records.
                                ■■ The k(2)(ii) exemption is available to introducing broker-dealers that clear all customer
                                     transactions on a fully disclosed basis with a clearing firm. In addition, the introducing
                                     firm (correspondent firm) must promptly transmit all customer funds and securities to its
                                     clearing broker-dealer. The clearing firm also must carry all customer accounts for cor-
                                     respondent firms looking to claim this exemption. The clearing firm is responsible in this
                                     arrangement to keep the books and records related to its correspondents’ accounts required
                                     under SEC Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4.

                                     The minimum net capital requirement for k(2)(i) firms clearing on an omnibus basis is
                                $100,000. If a firm wishes to change its exemptive status, direct the request to a designated
                                examining authority for prior written approval.
                                     Rule 15c3-3 requires that any customer with a free credit balance with a broker-dealer
                                receive a written statement of the amount due the customer by the broker-dealer. The state-
                                ment must also indicate that the amount is payable upon the customer’s demand, but until
                                then, the funds may be commingled with other customer’s funds and/or with the funds of the
                                broker-dealer, and therefore, may be used by the broker-dealer in the course of conducting
                                business. The written statement required under this rule must be sent to customers at least
                                once every three months unless there is activity in the account.
                                     Carrying broker-dealers also must perform a separate reserve computation for proprietary
                                accounts of other brokers (PAB accounts) in addition to the customer reserve computation
                                required by Rule 15c3-3. In addition, carrying firms must establish a separate reserve bank
                                account for the benefit of PAB accounts and obtain and maintain physical possession or con-
                                trol of non-margin securities carried for PAB accounts.

                  2. 17         FIDELITY BOND REQUIREMENTS (FINRA RULE 4360)
                                     FINRA Rule 4360 requires all member firms (including one-man firms) to join SIPC and
                                 to secure fidelity bonding insurance to insure against employee theft or embezzlement, fraudu-
                                 lent trading, and forgery of securities or checks. The rule requires a member with a net capital
                                 requirement of less than $250,000 to maintain minimum coverage of 120% of the firm’s net
                                 capital requirement or $100,000, whichever is greater. Firms with net capital requirements of
                                 $250,000 or more must purchase an amount found on a FINRA table found in the rule. (Refer
                                 to the Fidelity Bonding Coverage Table and become familiar with the coverages.) The higher
                                 the minimum, the more the required bond. Members must review the adequacy of coverage
                                 annually, even if the firm buys multi-year policies. Firms that act solely as DMMs or floor bro-
                                 kers are exempt from this entire rule if they do no business with the public.

                                                        In determining their fidelity bonding requirement, firms must use their highest net
                                                   capital requirement over the 12 months preceding the computation. The preceding
                                                   12-month period includes the 12-month period that ends 60 days before the yearly
                                                   anniversary date of the bond. This allows sufficient time for a firm to determine its
                                                   required amount of the fidelity bond by the anniversary date. Member firms must
                                                   review coverage annually.

                                    A deductible provision may be included in the bond up to $5,000 or 10% of the minimum
                                required coverage, whichever is greater. If a member’s policy includes a deductible greater than
                                this, the difference must be charged against net worth for capital computation purposes.
                                    Member firms must immediately advise FINRA in writing if its fidelity bond is terminated,
                                cancelled, or substantially modified.

                                                                     Fidelity Bonding Coverage Table

                                    If a member firm is experiencing financial or operational difficulties, FINRA has the
                                authority to prohibit expansion or require a reduction in the member’s overall level of busi-
                                ness. The following guidelines are applied by FINRA.
                                    A member may be prohibited from expanding its business if either of the following has
                                existed for more than 15 consecutive business days:
                                ■■ Net capital is less than 150% of its minimum requirement

                                            In imposing restrictions, FINRA may require the member to take one or more of the fol-
                                        lowing actions:
                                        ■■ Promptly pay all free credit balances to customers
                                        ■■ Promptly make delivery to customers of all fully paid securities in the member’s possession

                                        ■■ Postpone the opening of new branches or close one or more existing branches

                                            In addition to having the authority to direct members either not to expand their business
                                        operations or to reduce their business operations, FINRA has the authority to direct members
                                        to suspend all business operations during any period when the member is not in compliance
                                        with the net capital rule. If a member’s capital is below its minimum requirement, FINRA can
                                        force a firm to shut down.



                  2. 19             WITHDRAWAL OF EQUITY CAPITAL
                                            Capital may not be withdrawn by officers or partners of members, or by parent companies
                                        or subsidiaries if the effect would be to have the firm’s capital fall below 120% of minimum, or
                                        cause its AI-to-NC ratio to exceed 10:1.
                                            Certain withdrawals of equity require that notification be made to the SEC. If the amount
                                        to be withdrawn in any 30-calendar-day period will exceed 30% of the firm’s excess net capital
                                        (capital in excess of its minimum requirement), notify the SEC two business days in advance
                                        of the withdrawal. The SEC has the right to restrict the withdrawal of equity capital if it
                                        appears that the financial integrity of the firm will be compromised.

                                    Be mindful that the SEC believes that capital contributions to broker-dealers should not
                                be temporary in nature. Therefore, any capital contributed under an agreement that gives the
                                contributor the right to withdraw the capital, or that is intended to be withdrawn within one
                                year, must be excluded from net capital. In other words, deduct the contribution during the
                                calculation.



       2. 20            CLEARING AGREEMENTS
                                     Most broker-dealers rely on another member firm to provide clearing, custody, and execu-
                                tion services. Where needed, a clearing firm may provide prime brokerage, exception reports,
                                stock lending and borrowing, financing margin, risk monitoring, direct market access (DMA),
                                and much more. In short, an introducing firm outsources many important jobs. By allowing
                                other firms to perform these critical functions, a fully disclosed introducing firm can focus on
                                its core activities while its clearing firm may look to providing its clients with good service,
                                economies of scale, and expertise in technology.
                                     All clearing agreements between an introducing firm and its clearing agent must, at a
                                minimum, specify the responsibilities of each party with respect to:
                                ■■ opening, approving, and monitoring customer accounts;
                                ■■ extension of credit;
                                ■■ maintenance of books and records;
                                ■■ receipt and delivery of funds and securities;
                                ■■ confirmations and statements; and
                                ■■ acceptance of orders and execution of transactions.

                                     If the agreement allows the introducing firm to execute away (enter orders through firms
                                other than the clearing broker), this is a give up clearing arrangement. This means the intro-
                                ducing firm, when executing away, gives up the name of its clearing broker to each firm with
                                which it enters orders. This alerts these firms that payment for purchases and delivery of secu-
                                rities sold will be handled by the clearing broker, not the introducing firm.
                                     The agreement must require the clearing broker, if it receives a customer complaint con-
                                cerning the introducing firm, to immediately forward the complaint to both the introducing
                                firm and FINRA. The clearing firm must notify the customer that the complaint was received
                                and forwarded.
                                     A clearing firm, when it enters into a clearing agreement, must immediately, and annually
                                thereafter by July 1 of each year, provide the introducing firm with a list of exception reports
                                available to assist the introducing firm in supervising its business. The list of available excep-
                                tion reports must be given to the introducing firm’s chief executive officer and its compliance
                                officers as well as to FINRA.

                  2. 21         TRUST INDENTURE ACT OF 1939 (TIA)
                                       The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 was created to afford protection to purchasers of newly
                                  issued corporate debt securities by more precisely defining the role of trustees and their quali-
                                  fications and duties to bondholders. In addition to meeting the registration requirements of
                                  the Securities Act of 1933, a corporate bond issuer, prior to registration, must prepare a trust
                                  indenture, which calls for the appointment of a trustee, normally a commercial bank. The
                                  principal job of the trustee is to protect bondholders in the event of default.
                                       The trust indenture also provides the trustee with the power necessary to enforce the
                                  issuer’s obligations and the debt holder’s rights.
                                       In a shelf offering, an open-ended form of trust indenture may be used. This permits a
                                  series of debt securities to be offered from time to time with the disclosure of the interest rate,
                                  term et cetera, to be furnished as an exhibit to Form 8-K and “stickered” to the prospectus.
                                       There are certain exemptions from the Act. One example includes an offering of a debt
                                  security issued with an equity security in a unit. In that case, the determination as to whether
                                  an exemption is available is based on the aggregate principal amount of the debt security and
                                  not the dollar amount of the equity security. If the aggregate amount of the debt security is less
                                  than $5 million, the offering is exempt from the TIA.



                  2. 22         INVESTMENT COMPANIES


                  2. 22. 1 INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940
                                      During the 1930s, Congress directed the SEC to study investment trusts and investment
                                  companies, their corporate structures, their investment policies, and their influence on the
                                  companies in which they invest. This study led to the passage of the Investment Company Act
                                  of 1940, providing for SEC regulation of investment companies and their activities.
                                      The act was designed to protect investors from unfair dealings, to regulate borrowing by
                                  investment company management, and to provide investors with current information. The
                                  act does not regulate ethical sales practices, which are covered by the Securities Exchange Act
                                  of 1934, and various rules and regulations put forth by various self-regulatory organizations
                                  (SROs).
                                      The act defines an investment company as an issuer that is engaged, or proposes to engage,
                                  in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities, and owns or
                                  proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding 40% of the value of such
                                  issuer’s total assets (exclusive of Government securities and cash items). Furthermore, the act
                                  created three classifications of investment company:
                                  ■■ Face amount certificate company
                                  ■■ Unit investment trust
                                  ■■ Management investment company

                                      These companies are all portfolio intermediaries in the business of pooling the public’s
                                  money and investing it. You may see the term, “pooled investment vehicle” used to describe
                                  investment companies. An investment company that has at least $100,000 under manage-
                                  ment must register by submitting Form N-1A with the Commission.

                                    The definition of investment company does not include a holding company or a variable
                                annuity. This fact may be tested (it is the separate account that is the investment company).
                                    As a principal, you will find that the products described in this act are most relevant to
                                your job. As we have done with the previous federal laws, we’ll list some of the important
                                terms and their definitions.


       2. 22. 2 MANAGEMENT COMPANIES
                                     Management companies are of two types: (1) open-end, and (2) closed-end. An open-end
                                company (mutual fund) makes a continuous offering of shares to the public (i.e., it will sell
                                as many shares to the public as there is demand). The monies acquired are invested in accor-
                                dance with the fund’s investment objectives. Mutual funds are redeemable, which means there
                                is no secondary market. When a shareholder wants to sell, the shares are redeemed by the fund
                                or its agent.
                                     A closed-end fund is a publicly traded fund. The fund makes a onetime issue of shares,
                                which then trade in the secondary market. Shares of closed-end funds are said to be negotiable
                                (not redeemable).
                                     As mutual funds make a continuous offering of shares, each sale is essentially a new issue
                                and must be sold with a prospectus. With publicly traded funds, only the initial offering is sold
                                with a prospectus.


       2. 22. 3 UNIT INVESTMENT TRUSTS
                                    Unit trusts are of two types: (1) fixed, and (2) participating. A fixed trust is a trust that
                                selects a portfolio of securities (usually bonds) and places the securities in a trust. Once in
                                place, the securities are not traded (i.e., the portfolio is fixed). As the securities pay interest
                                (or are called or mature), the proceeds are distributed, pro rata, to the unit holders. Over time,
                                the trust self-liquidates. Fixed unit trusts are closed-end trusts, which means there are a fixed
                                number of units outstanding.
                                    A participating unit trust is a trust that, rather than purchasing specific securities, pur-
                                chases shares of mutual funds. Buyers are indirectly purchasing mutual fund shares. This is the
                                structure used for variable annuities. Both fixed and participating unit trusts are redeemable
                                securities, and each is sold with a prospectus.

                                Company Act of 1940, a diversified investment company is one that meets the requirements
                                of the 75-5-10 test.
                                ■■ At least 75% of the fund’s total assets must be invested in securities issued by companies
                                    other than the investment company itself or its affiliates.
                                ■■ The 75% must be invested in such a way that:
                                    —— no more than 5% of the fund’s total assets are invested in the securities of any one
                                       issuer, and
                                    —— the fund may not own more than 10% of the outstanding voting securities of any one
                                       issuer.

                    EXAMPLE                             Assume a mutual fund has $200,000 total assets. To call itself diversified, at
                                                   least $150,000 must be invested so no more than $10,000 may be invested in the
                                                   securities of any one company (5% of the total $200,000); if a target company has
                                                   $100,000 of outstanding common stock, the mutual fund could own no more than
                                                   $10,000 of that stock (10% of $100,000).

                                    A nondiversified investment company fails to meet the 75-5-10 test. An investment com-
                                pany that specializes in a single industry is not necessarily a nondiversified company. Some
                                investment companies choose to concentrate their assets in an industry or a geographic area,
                                such as health care, technology, or mining companies. These are known as specialized or sec-
                                tor funds. An investment company that invests in a single industry may still be considered
                                diversified as long as it satisfies the 75-5-10 test.

                                                        Both open- and closed-end companies can be diversified or nondiversified.



       2. 22. 5 REGISTRATION OF MANAGEMENT COMPANIES
                                    Management company securities are nonexempt, which means they must be registered
                                with the SEC before public sale. The registration is made on Form N-IA. A management com-
                                pany is not permitted to issue securities to the public unless it has capital of at least $100,000.
                                    In addition to financial information, the company must provide the SEC with information
                                on:
                                ■■ its investment objectives;
                                ■■ its policy on borrowing money;
                                ■■ its policy on issuing senior securities;
                                ■■ its policy on making loans; and
                                ■■ the names and addresses of all affiliated persons, including the investment adviser.

                                     Open-end funds can only issue voting common stock but are permitted to borrow money
                                from banks for short-term needs. Closed-end funds, in addition to issuing common stock, are
                                permitted to issue senior securities, such as bonds and preferred stock. They are also permitted
                                to borrow from banks.
                                     If a management company is open end, the need for an underwriter, called the sponsor, to
                                distribute shares is ongoing, because shares are continuously offered and sold. If the manage-
                                ment company is closed end, the underwriting and distribution process is generally limited to
                                a single offering.
                                     A management company typically contracts with an investment adviser to invest the
                                company’s assets, implement investment strategies consistent with the company’s investment
                                objectives, and manage the day-to-day trading of the portfolio’s securities. Advisers are gener-
                                ally compensated based on a percentage of assets under management.

                        2. 22. 5. 1 Prospectus updating
                                        Because open-end investment companies continuously offer new shares, all sales must be
                                    made by prospectus. A mutual fund is required to periodically update its prospectus. The SEC
                                    requires that a prospectus in use for more than nine months cannot contain financial informa-
                                    tion more than 16 months old.

                                EXAMPLE                  A prospectus dated February 1, 2014, contains financial information through
                                                    September 30, 2013. At that point, the financial information is four months old. Nine

                                                    At that point it can be used for another three months.

                                         An affiliated person is any person who directly or indirectly owns, controls, or holds, with
                                    power to vote, 5% or more of the outstanding voting securities of a company; any officer, direc-

                                    of an investment company.


                  2. 22. 7 INTERESTED PERSON
                                       With respect to an investment company, an interested person includes any:
                                    ■■ affiliated person of the company (previously defined, but excluding certain board mem-

                                    The principal underwriter for an investment company or fund (sometimes referred to as
                                the sponsor or distributor) is the fund’s chief salesperson. The principal underwriter is respon-
                                sible for the distribution of the investment company’s shares.


       2. 22. 9 REDEEMABLE SECURITY
                                    A redeemable security is any security under the terms of which the holder, upon presenta-
                                tion to the issuer, is entitled to receive his proportionate share of the issuer’s current net assets.
                                When used on the exam, this definition always refers to mutual funds, variable annuities, and
                                unit investment trusts.

                                    Sales load is the difference between the price of a security to the public and the net por-
                                tion of the proceeds from its sale that is received and invested or held for investment by the

       2. 22. 10 SEPARATE ACCOUNT
                                    A separate account is an account established and maintained by an insurance company
                                in which income, gains, and losses—whether realized or not—from assets allocated to the
                                account are in accordance with the applicable variable annuity or variable life insurance con-
                                tract. In almost all cases, the separate account is registered as an investment company under
                                the act.

                                            SEC Rule 35d-1, called the name test rule, requires that an investment company with

                        2. 22. 12. 1 Pricing and Sales Charges
                                            The net asset value NAV per share of an investment company is its book value (net
                                        worth) per share (total assets less total liabilities divided by the number of shares outstanding).
                                        The primary determinant of NAV is the market value of the securities held by the company.
                                            Rule 22c-1 promulgated under the 1940 Act provides that the net asset value of redeem-
                                        able securities (mutual funds and UITs) has to be computed no less frequently than once
                                        daily, typically after the major U.S. exchanges close (4:00 pm ET). The computation is then
                                        reported to FINRA and financial media. A closed-end fund, whose shares are not “redeem-
                                        able”, that is, not required to be repurchased by the fund, is not subject to this requirement.
                                            Unless it is a no-load fund, redeemable investment company securities are sold with a sales
                                        charge. The sales charge (load) can be front-end loaded or back-end loaded. There may also
                                        be a charge against the average annual net assets of the company (12b-1).
                                            A front-end load is charged when an investor purchases shares. It is added to the NAV
                                        of the company. A back-end load contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC) is taken out on
                                        redemption of company shares.
                                            An asset-based charge, or 12b-1 fee, allows the company to charge certain selling and
                                        distribution expenses to its assets. These charges, which are computed on an annual basis but
                                        charged to the shareholder quarterly, are intended to result in the sale of additional shares.

                    EXAMPLE                            12b-1 charges include advertising, the printing and mailing of prospectuses to
                                                   persons other than current shareholders, and compensation of sales personnel.

                                    For companies without an asset-based sales charge, the maximum permissible sales charge
                                under FINRA rules is 8½% of the public offering price. FINRA rules limit 12b-1 fees to .75%
                                of the average annual net assets of the investment company.
                                    Pricing of redeemable investment company securities is based on NAV per share. In a
                                front-end-loaded company, the customer pays the public offering price (POP), which is NAV
                                per share with a sales charge added.
                                    In a back-end-loaded fund, the customer buys at NAV and redeems at NAV less a sales
                                charge. Sales charges for back-end load funds decline over time. The longer the shares are
                                held, the lower the sales charge on redemption.
                                    Pricing of redeemable investment company securities is done on a forward basis. Orders to
                                buy or redeem are filled based on the next computed NAV per share.
                                    With closed-end (publicly traded) funds, the NAV has no direct bearing on the market
                                price, because that price is determined by open market supply and demand. Unlike open-end
                                funds, closed-end funds can, and frequently do, trade in the market at a discount to the NAV.
                                    Under extraordinary circumstances (e.g., the markets are closed due to a precipitous
                                decline in market averages), the SEC is empowered to suspend redemptions of redeemable
                                investment company securities until the markets reopen and NAV per share can be computed.




                     *
                    EXAMPLE                             After the events of 9/11 (a Tuesday), the U.S. stock markets were closed until
                                                   the following Monday (September 17). During that period of 4 days, all redemptions
                                                   were suspended.



                                2. 22. 12. 1. 1   Distribution and Repurchase of Securities by Closed-end
                                Investment Companies (Section 23)
                                    Unless one of several unusual situations exists, no registered closed-end company can sell
                                any common stock of which it is the issuer at a price below the current net asset value of such
                                stock. Although shares in the secondary market will frequently trade at a discount due to sup-
                                ply and demand, issuance (primary) must always be at net asset value.
                                    One other condition that applies to these companies deals with repurchase of shares.
                                Unlike open-end companies, there is no redemption of shares. No registered closed-end com-
                                pany can purchase any securities of any class of which it is the issuer except on a securities
                                exchange or other regulated market. If the securities are stock (remember, close-end companies
                                can issue debt securities), the company must, within the preceding six months, have informed
                                stockholders of its intention to purchase stock of such class by letter or report addressed to
                                stockholders of such class.


             2. 22. 12. 2               12b-1 Fees
                                    As a general statement, funds are prohibited from charging to stockholders any selling
                                expenses of the fund; only operating expenses can be charged against investment income.
                                However, under SEC Rule 12b-1, certain selling and distribution expenses can be charged to
                                shareholders.

                                            To charge an asset-based fee, the fund must have a majority vote of the shareholders, a
                                        majority vote of the board, and a majority vote of the outside (independent) directors. In addi-
                                        tion, 12b-1 fees must be reapproved annually. Once in place, 12b-1 charges must be reviewed
                                        quarterly by the BOD.
                                            To terminate 12b-1 charges, a majority vote of the shareholders or a majority vote of the
                                        outside directors is needed.


                        2. 22. 12. 3 Sales Agreements
                                            For a broker-dealer to sell redeemable investment company securities, there must be a
                                        written sales agreement between the company or its sponsor (principal underwriter) and the
                                        broker-dealer.
                                            Both the sponsor and the broker-dealer must be FINRA members.
                                            The agreement, as well as the prospectus, must specify the sales concession to be received
                                        from the sponsor for selling shares and must reiterate that all sales to the public be made at
                                        the public offering price—the member selling shares must maintain the POP not only to its
                                        customers but also to nonmember broker-dealers or to suspended member firms. Only FINRA
                                        members with written selling agreements with the sponsor can buy shares at a discount (less a
                                        concession) for sale at the POP.
                                            If the sponsor offers special compensation to a particular member and not to all members
                                        distributing shares of the fund, the details of the arrangement, as well as the name of the mem-
                                        ber benefiting from the arrangement, must be disclosed in the prospectus.


                        2. 22. 12. 4 Placing Orders
                                             Orders to buy or redeem must be promptly communicated to the investment company
                                        or its sponsor. Withholding a customer order so as to profit is a rules violation. Orders can be
                                        placed:
                                        ■■ to fill an existing customer order; or
                                        ■■ for the member’s investment account.

                                TA K E N O T E
                                                             A member cannot buy shares for its inventory; this is to ensure that there is only
                                                        one market maker for the fund’s shares—the fund itself. Shares bought by members
                                                        for investment cannot be resold to customers. They can only be redeemed with the
                                                        fund.

                                            Prompt Payment. Members must promptly transmit payments received from customers
                                        to the fund or its sponsor within three business days of trade date or within one business day
                                        of receipt, whichever is later.

                                             Redemptions. FINRA rules require that if a customer redeems shares within seven busi-
                                        ness days of purchase, the member must forfeit the concession received to the fund or its
                                        sponsor. Repurchasing shares from a customer at a price less than the next computed NAV
                                        is a rules violation.

             2. 22. 12. 5 Anti-Reciprocal Rule
                                   The anti-reciprocal rule is designed to soften conflicts of interest between members that
                                have selling agreements with a fund and to execute portfolio transactions for that fund.
                                   FINRA prohibits its members from:
                                ■■ favoring one fund over another based on commissions received from executing portfolio
                                   transactions for the fund;
                                ■■ soliciting portfolio transaction business from a fund based on the member’s sales of the
                                   fund’s shares; and
                                ■■ circulating information on the amount of brokerage commissions earned from executing
                                   portfolio transactions for a fund.

                    EXAMPLE                             A member cannot have a fund direct portfolio trades to it and begin selling the
                                                   fund’s shares, any more than a fund can have a member sell the fund and direct port-
                                                   folio trades to the firm.
                                                        Further, a member may not sell the shares of, or act as underwriter for, a fund
                                                   that follows a policy of considering sales of its shares as a factor in selecting firms
                                                   to execute portfolio transactions. Similarly, funds are prohibited from compensating
                                                   members for selling their shares by directing portfolio trades (directed brokerage ar-
                                                   rangements) to that firm.
                                                       A member firm is not permitted to sell shares of, or act as underwriter for, any
                                                   fund that the member knows, or has reason to know, engages in directing broker-
                                                   age in consideration for the sale of shares of that fund. This prohibition applies even
                                                   where a directed brokerage arrangement exists between the fund and a different
                                                   member firm.


             2. 22. 12. 6 Distributions
                                    Under Section 19 of the Act, all dividends and capital gains distributions to shareholders
                                must clearly be identified and accounted for separately at the time of the distribution. A state-
                                ment or transmittal letter must provide an accounting of each distribution, indicating whether
                                the distribution represents:
                                ■■ dividends (from accumulated undistributed net income or current income);
                                ■■ undistributed profits (capital gains); or
                                ■■ paid-in surplus (return of principal).

                                   In addition, while portfolio income may be distributed to shareholder accounts as fre-
                                quently as the fund sees fit, capital gains must not be distributed more than once every 12
                                months.

                                    Funds that charge 12b-1 fees must disclose, in reports to shareholders, the amounts charged
                                to net assets.

                                         Encouraging a customer to buy mutual fund shares just before the ex-date to receive the
                                     upcoming dividend is a FINRA rules violation. This is a violation, because the customer will
                                     receive the dividend, which is taxable, and the NAV per share will be reduced by the amount
                                     of the dividend—similar to receiving a return of capital that is being taxed.
                                         In addition, no member can represent that distribution of long-term capital gains by a
                                     mutual fund if it is part of the current yield.


                        2. 22. 12. 9 Breakpoints
                                         Breakpoints are quantity discounts: the greater the dollar amount of a purchase, the lower
                                     the sales charge. The following chart shows a sample of a chart of breakpoints.
                                         A single mutual fund generally offers more than one class of shares to investors. Each class
                                     represents the same interest in the fund’s portfolio but has different fees and expenses. A typi-
                                     cal class structure is as follows.
                                     ■■ Class A shares. These shares charge a front-end load on the initial purchase, which can
                                         be reduced or eliminated by breakpoint discounts. They may also charge 12b-1 fees that
                                         are typically lower than Class B or Class C shares.
                                     ■■ Class B shares. These shares charge a back-end load that declines over time. They gener-
                                         ally charge 12b-1 fees that are typically higher than Class A shares. Most Class B shares
                                         convert to Class A shares, generally after the CDSL (conditional deferred sales load) has
                                         expired (6 – 8 years).
                                     ■■ Class C shares. These shares typically charge a back-end load that is eliminated after one
                                         year. They also charge 12b-1 fees that are generally higher than Class A shares.

                                    Breakpoints are only available on the purchase of Class A shares. For large purchases, the
                                front-end load can be reduced or eliminated. Class B shares do not impose a front-end load,
                                but they may charge investors more over the lifetime of their investment than do Class A
                                shares. Breakpoints also are available to investors who:
                                ■■ already hold other funds offered by the same fund family;
                                ■■ commit to regularly purchasing mutual fund shares; or
                                ■■ have family members (spouse and minor children).

                                                       Frequently overlooked when attempting to determine if a client qualifies for
                                                   a breakpoint, are holdings of shares in a retirement plan, such as an IRA or even a
                                                   401(k) plan.

                                     Failure to properly grant breakpoint discounts when available led, in 2002, the staffs of
                                NASD (FINRA’s predecessor), the SEC, and the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to con-
                                duct examinations of broker-dealers to assess their ability to deliver breakpoint discounts. In
                                March of 2003, they published a report on those examinations stating that most of the 43
                                broker-dealers examined failed to provide the appropriate breakpoint discount to customers in
                                a significant number of cases. The group of firms examined in the sweep did not provide break-
                                points in about 1/3 of the breakpoint-eligible transactions analyzed, and the average dollar
                                amount of the discount not provided was $364. The Joint Report, however, noted that most
                                breakpoint problems did not appear to be intentional failures to charge correct sales loads.
                                     The ultimate result of the study was the 2004 enforcement actions brought by the SEC
                                and the NASD against 15 prominent firms for failure to deliver mutual fund breakpoint dis-
                                counts. The SEC’s actions at that time were intended to send a message that broker-dealers
                                had to exercise due care to provide breakpoint discounts to mutual fund investors consistent
                                with the promises made to customers. These firms agreed to pay more than $21.5 million in
                                fines and over $86 million in “disgorged” profits to settle charges of denying breakpoint dis-
                                counts to mutual fund customers.

                                                       Breakpoint discounts usually start at investment levels of $50,000, but may begin
                                                   at $25,000. The following is a sample breakpoint schedule.

                                             Soft dollars is a term used to describe payments made by institutional investors, such as
                                        mutual funds to broker-dealers in return for services, such as research. The difference between
                                        soft dollars and hard dollars is that instead of paying a broker-dealer with cash (hard dollars),
                                        the mutual fund will pay in-kind by directing brokerage business (soft dollars).
                                             Under SEC guidelines, soft dollars may be used to pay for research reports, software that
                                        provides analyses of securities portfolios, services for the benefit of clients, and seminar reg-
                                        istration fees. The safe harbor for this kind of activity is found under Section 28(e) of the
                                        Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The safe harbor does not permit the use of soft dollars
                                        for computer hardware, telecommunications lines, office equipment, reimbursement of travel
                                        expenses to attend seminars, and other operational overhead, such as rent. Lastly, member
                                        firms that offer soft dollar commission sharing arrangements are not required to maintain a
                                        special reserve bank account for that reason alone.

                                ■■ own commercial property (equity REITs);
                                ■■ own mortgages on commercial property (mortgage REITs); or
                                ■■ do both (hybrid REITs).

                                    For a company to qualify as a REIT, it must comply with certain provisions within the
                                Internal Revenue Code. As required by the Tax Code, a REIT must:
                                ■■ be an entity that is taxable as a corporation;
                                ■■ be managed by a board of directors or trustees;
                                ■■ have shares that are fully transferable;
                                ■■ have a minimum of 100 shareholders;
                                ■■ invest at least 75% of its total assets in real estate assets;
                                ■■ derive at least 75% of its gross income from rents from real property or interest on mort-
                                    gages financing real property; and
                                ■■ pay annually at least 90% of its taxable income in the form of shareholder dividends.

                                    Remember that REITs are not considered “flow-through” investments (like DPPs), because
                                losses do not pass through to the shareholders.

                  2. 23         VARIABLE ANNUITIES
                                     An annuity is a contract between an individual and an insurance company, usually pur-
                                 chased for retirement income. Investors, called annuitants, contribute money to an annuity
                                 plan either in a lump sum or as periodic contractual payments. At some future time (specified
                                 in the contract), the owner of the annuity plan will either begin receiving regular income
                                 distributions or take a lump sum distribution.
                                     A fixed annuity has a guaranteed rate of return. When the individual elects to begin
                                 receiving income, payout is determined by the value of the account and the annuitant’s life
                                 expectancy. Payment from a fixed annuity remains constant throughout the annuitant’s life.
                                 The sales representative and annuitant must be mindful that inflation can shrink purchasing
                                 power over time. Because the return in a fixed annuity is guaranteed by the insurance com-
                                 pany and no risk is borne by the annuitant, a fixed annuity is considered an insurance product.
                                 Because of this insurance aspect, a salesperson must have an insurance license to sell fixed
                                 annuities.
                                     A variable annuity, on the other hand, does not guarantee a rate of return. The customer’s
                                 funds are at risk; however, there is a chance at beating inflation. Therefore, both an insurance
                                 license and a securities license (Series 6 or 7) are required to sell variable contracts.
                                     Variable annuities, as retirement vehicles, are often nonqualified, which means that pay-
                                 ments made by annuitants are made with after-tax dollars. On withdrawal, only the earnings
                                 generated on the monies contributed to the annuity are taxable.

                                                                       Fixed vs. Variable Annuity

       2. 23. 1 RULE 2330: MEMBERS’ RESPONSIBILITIES REGARDING
                DEFERRED VARIABLE ANNUITIES
                                    In light of the large number of cases involving variable annuities where there was failure
                                to supervise and egregious unethical behavior, FINRA’s Rule 2330 evolved.


             2. 23. 1. 1 Application
                                     Before going into the specific details of this rule, it is necessary to know when the rule is
                                and when it is not applicable. This rule applies to recommended purchases and exchanges of
                                deferred (NOT immediate) variable annuities and recommended initial subaccount alloca-
                                tions. On the other hand, this rule does not apply to reallocations among subaccounts made
                                or to funds paid after the initial purchase or exchange of a deferred variable annuity. This rule
                                also does not apply to deferred variable annuity transactions made in connection with any
                                tax-qualified, employer-sponsored retirement or benefit plan that either is defined as a “quali-
                                fied plan” or meets the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Sections 403(b) or 457. The
                                exception to this is if a member or person associated with a member makes recommendations
                                to an individual plan participant regarding a deferred variable annuity, in which case the Rule
                                would apply as to the individual plan participant to whom the member or person associated
                                with the member makes such recommendations.


             2. 23. 1. 2 Suitability
                                      The rule makes the obvious statement that no member or person associated with a mem-
                                ber shall recommend to any customer the purchase or exchange of a deferred variable annuity
                                unless the member or person associated with a member has a reasonable basis to believe that
                                it is suitable.

                                                       A 1035 exchange is a tax-free exchange between like contracts. The IRS permits
                                                   annuity and life policyholders to exchange their policies without tax liability. For ex-
                                                   ample, if a life policyholder wanted to exchange a policy to that of another company,
                                                   he could transfer all values from the old policy into the new one without recognizing
                                                   any tax consequences. However, Section 1035 exchanges have their limits. For ex-
                                                   ample, clients can use the provision to exchange life insurance for annuities, life insur-
                                                   ance for life insurance, and annuities for annuities. They cannot, however, exchange
                                                   annuities for life insurance.


                                2. 23. 1. 2. 1 Specific Suitability Requirements
                                    Although there are general suitability rules that always apply, this rule specifies that, in
                                order to be considered suitable, there is a reasonable basis to believe that:
                                ■■ the customer has been informed, in general terms, of various features of deferred variable
                                    annuities, such as
                                    —— the potential surrender period and surrender charge,
                                    —— the potential tax penalty if customers sell or redeem deferred variable annuities before

                                ■■ the customer would benefit from certain features of deferred variable annuities, such as
                                   tax-deferred growth, annuitization, or a death or living benefit; and

                                   funds are allocated at the time of the purchase or exchange of the deferred variable annu-
                                   ity, and riders and similar product enhancements, if any, are suitable (and, in the case of
                                   an exchange, the transaction as a whole also is suitable) for the particular customer based
                                   on the information required by this rule.

                                2. 23. 1. 2. 2 Exchanges
                                    If the recommendation is for an exchange of one deferred variable annuity for another
                                deferred variable annuity, the exchange also is consistent with the suitability determination
                                requirements previously stated, taking into consideration whether:
                                ■■ the customer would incur a surrender charge, be subject to the commencement of a new

                                    36 months. Under this provision, it must be determined whether the customer has made
                                    a VA exchange using the member and must make reasonable efforts to ascertain whether
                                    the customer has had an exchange at any other broker-dealer within the preceding 36
                                    months. An inquiry to the customer as to whether the customer has had an exchange at
                                    another broker-dealer within 36 months would constitute a “reasonable effort” in this con-
                                    text. Members shall document in writing both the nature of the inquiry and the response
                                    from the customer.

                                    The determination requirements previously stated must be documented and signed by the
                                associated person recommending the transaction.


                        2. 23. 1. 3 Training
                                    Members have to develop and document specific training policies or programs reason-
                                ably designed to ensure that associated persons who effect, as well as the registered principals
                                who review transactions in deferred variable annuities, comply with the requirements of this
                                rule and that they recognize and explain the material features of deferred variable annuities,
                                including those dealing with recommendations.


                        2. 23. 1. 4 Principal Review and Approval

                                ing insurance company for processing, but no later than seven business days after an office of
                                supervisory jurisdiction of the member receives a complete and correct application package,
                                a registered principal must review and determine whether to approve of the recommended
                                purchase or exchange of the deferred variable annuity. These determinations are to be docu-
                                mented and signed by the registered principal who reviewed and then approved or rejected
                                the transaction.

             2. 23. 1. 5 Supervisory Procedures
                                    In addition to the general supervisory and recordkeeping requirements of FINRA’s rules,
                                a member must establish and maintain specific written supervisory procedures reasonably
                                designed to achieve compliance with the standards set forth in Rule 2330. The member also
                                must:
                                ■■ implement surveillance procedures to determine if any of the member’s associated persons
                                    have rates of effecting deferred variable annuity exchanges that raise for review whether
                                    such rates of exchanges evidence conduct inconsistent with the applicable provisions of
                                    this Rule, other applicable rules, or the federal securities laws (“inappropriate exchanges”);
                                    and
                                ■■ have policies and procedures reasonably designed to implement corrective measures to
                                    address inappropriate exchanges and the conduct of associated persons who engage in
                                    inappropriate exchanges.


             2. 23. 1. 6 Handling Customer Funds and Checks
                                    Since it is rare to find an investment company/variable contracts broker-dealer that is
                                permitted to hold customer funds (most are exempt from the Customer Protection Rule, 15c3-
                                3), how does FINRA view holding the customer’s check made out to the insurance company
                                for up to seven business days? There are two FINRA rules that apply to this situation. One of
                                them could consider that this would be making improper use of customer’s funds, and the other
                                requires member firms to transmit applications and purchase payments for variable contracts
                                promptly to issuers. To avoid violations, FINRA has provided limited interpretive relief from
                                these rules to allow members to perform comprehensive and rigorous reviews of recommended
                                transactions in deferred variable annuities under Rule 2330. Concerns have been expressed,
                                however, regarding the breadth of the interpretive relief and the conditions that must be pres-
                                ent for it to apply. FINRA has clarified that the interpretive relief applies only if the following
                                conditions are present.
                                ■■ The reason that the firm is holding the application for a deferred variable annuity and/
                                    or a customer’s non-negotiated check payable to a third party is to allow completion of
                                    principal review of the transaction pursuant to FINRA Rule 2330.
                                ■■ The associated person who recommended the purchase or exchange of the deferred vari-
                                    able annuity makes reasonable efforts to safeguard the check and to promptly prepare and
                                    forward a complete and correct copy of the application package to an OSJ.
                                ■■ The firm has policies and procedures in place that are reasonably designed to ensure that
                                    the check is safeguarded and that reasonable efforts are made to promptly prepare and
                                    forward a complete and correct copy of the application package to an OSJ.
                                ■■ A principal reviews and makes a determination of whether to approve or reject the pur-
                                    chase or exchange of the deferred variable annuity in accordance with the provisions of
                                    FINRA Rule 2330.
                                ■■ The firm holds the application and/or check no longer than seven business days from the
                                    date an OSJ receives a complete and correct copy of the application package.
                                ■■ The firm maintains a copy of each such check and creates a record of the date the check
                                    was received from the customer and the date the check was transmitted to the insurance
                                    company or returned to the customer.
                                ■■ The firm creates a record of the date when the OSJ receives a complete and correct copy
                                    of the application package.

                                            If these conditions are not present, FINRA’s interpretive relief will not apply, and it will
                                        enforce the previously referred to rules as appropriate.

                                                             The idea of sharing office space and employees may arise. As Rule 2330 requires
                                                        principal review and approval prior to transmitting a customer’s application for a
                                                        deferred variable annuity to the issuing insurance company for processing, in circum-
                                                        stances where an insurance company and its affiliated broker-dealer share office space
                                                        and/or employees who carry out both the principal review as well as the issuance pro-
                                                        cess, the application is considered “transmitted” to the insurance company only after
                                                        the broker-dealer’s principal, acting in that capacity, has approved the transaction,
                                                        provided that the affiliated broker-dealer and the insurance company have agreed
                                                        that the insurance company will not issue the contract prior to principal approval by
                                                        the broker-dealer.



                  2. 23. 2 INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940
                                            This act was passed to regulate the activities of persons giving customers advice about
                                        securities. An investment adviser is one who, for compensation, provides advice about invest-
                                        ing in securities.
                                            The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 includes three characteristics of investment advis-
                                        ers under the federal definition of the term.
                                        ■■ They provide investment advice, specifically on securities.
                                        ■■ They hold themselves out to the public, or advertise, as investment advisers.
                                        ■■ They receive compensation specifically for their investment advice.

                                            There are exemptions from this definition—those that fit the definition but are exempt
                                        from the provisions. There are also exclusions—those that are deliberately left out of the
                                        definition.


                        2. 23. 2. 1 Exemptions
                                        ■■ Advisers who maintain offices in only one state, whose clients are all in that state, and
                                           who do not give advice on securities listed on any national exchange.
                                        ■■ Advisers whose only clients are insurance companies.

                                                        clients are all in one state and who offer no advice on securities listed on national

                                                        vestment advice is incidental to their professions [e.g., lawyers, accountants, teachers,

             2. 23. 2. 2 Exclusions
                                   The definition of investment adviser does not include:
                                ■■ banks and bank-holding companies;
                                ■■ publishers of any bona fide newspaper or magazine or business or financial publication of
                                   general and regular circulation (e.g., The Wall Street Journal or Business Week);
                                ■■ brokers or dealers (or their associated persons and registered representatives) whose invest-
                                   ment advice is incidental to the conduct of the broker-dealer’s business and who receive
                                   no special compensation for the advice;
                                ■■ government Securities Advisers (this exclusion is available to persons and firms whose
                                   advice is limited to certain securities issued by or guaranteed by the U.S. government); or
                                ■■ persons whose investment advice is incidental to their professions (e.g., lawyers, accoun-
                                   tants, engineers, teachers).

                                                        As previously mentioned, the exception granted to broker-dealers only applies
                                                   if the firm does not charge specifically for giving advice. If a member firm were to
                                                   set up a financial planning operation and charge separately for this service, the firm
                                                   would be considered an investment adviser. The most common example of losing the
                                                   exclusion is when the member offers wrap fee programs.


             2. 23. 2. 3 Registration of Investment Advisers
                                    Any person included under the federal definition of an investment adviser must regis-
                                ter with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, unless that person is exempt.
                                SEC-registered investment advisers are known as federal covered advisers. That term origi-
                                nated with the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, generally referred to
                                as NSMIA. NSMIA split the responsibility of regulation of investment advisers between the
                                states and the SEC on the basis of the amount of money the adviser has under management. In
                                the same manner that broker-dealers register by completing Forms NMA and BD, investment
                                advisers file a Form ADV. Although federal covered investment advisers do not register at the
                                state level, they may still be required to pay state filing fees.
                                    The following advisers must register with the SEC:
                                ■■ Persons with $110 million or more in AUM
                                ■■ Persons managing an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act
                                    of 1940

                                     An investment adviser that is not subject to federal registration requirements will gener-
                                ally be required to register with the state(s) where it conducts business.

                                                      Investment advisers with under $100 million of assets under management (AUM)
                                                 register at the state level. There are a few exceptions to this, but they are not testable
                                                 for the Series 24. Advisers managing at least $100 million, but not $110 million, have
                                                 the option to register with either the state(s) or the SEC. Once registered at the fed-
                                                 eral level, an adviser would not register at the state level unless AUM falls below $90
                                                 million. In essence, there is a $20 million buffer as advisers must register at the federal
                                                 level with $110 million of AUM and may maintain federal registration until AUM falls
                                                 below $90 million.

                  3. 1          SUPERVISION OF ACCOUNT OPENING/EXISTING
                                ACCOUNTS


                  3. 1. 1        CUSTOMER INFORMATION
                                     The Know Your Customer rule, FINRA Rule 2090, along with Rule 2111 (suitability)
                                 requires registered representatives to be diligent in learning the essential facts about each
                                 account opened. In a broad sense, knowing about a customer is key to acting with high stan-
                                 dards of commercial honor and just and equitable principals of trade (FINRA Rule 2010).
                                 This customer information is recorded on the new account form and becomes subject to the
                                 record-keeping requirement of the firm once accepted by signature of a partner, officer, or
                                 manager.
                                     It would be appropriate for a supervisor to return without his signature a new account form
                                 to a registered representative who failed to properly obtain key customer account information.
                                 A representative who developed a pattern of submitting for approval incomplete new account
                                 forms would be a source of concern to a diligent supervisor. Direction for the representative
                                 to go back to the customer and get all the information, as well as establishing a documented
                                 re-training program, would be wholly consistent with good supervisory practices and building
                                 a culture of compliance.
                                     Generally, FINRA Rule 4512 requires the following information to be obtained:
                                 ■■ Name, address, phone number, and occupation of customer
                                 ■■ Name and address of employer
                                 ■■ Whether the customer is an associated person of another member firm
                                 ■■ Social Security number or tax ID number
                                 ■■ Whether the customer is of legal age
                                 ■■ Whether the account will be a cash or margin account
                                 ■■ Whether the customer is employed by another broker-dealer
                                 ■■ Whether the customer is an officer, director, or more than 10% shareholder of a publicly
                                     traded company (See Control Stock in Unit 5)
                                 ■■ Citizenship (U.S. or non-U.S.)
                                 ■■ Annual income, net worth, and investment objectives
                                 ■■ Investment experience
                                 ■■ Investment time horizon
                                 ■■ Liquidity needs
                                 ■■ Risk tolerance
                                 ■■ Investment objective
                                 ■■ Registered representative responsible for the account

                                     It is not unusual to have rules relaxed somewhat for certain classes of investors, such as
                                 institutional accounts, which comprise the following:
                                 ■■ Banks, savings and loans, insurance companies, or registered investment companies
                                 ■■ Investment advisers registered either with the SEC or the states
                                 ■■ Any natural person, corporation, partnership, or trust with total assets of at least $50 mil-
                                     lion.

                                    For some investments, a continuing financial commitment is needed. The firm must have
                                a reasonable expectation that a customer will be able to satisfy that commitment.
                                    No member may carry on its books an account in the name of a person other than that of
                                the customer. However, an account may be designated by a number or a symbol, so long as the
                                member firm has on file a written statement signed by the customer attesting the ownership
                                of the account.
                                    While it is clearly important to obtain information about the customer during the on-
                                boarding process, it also is essential that investors, particularly non-institutional investors,
                                be cautioned about the risks inherent in certain investment practices and strategies as well as
                                accounts, such as day-trading and margin accounts.

                        3. 1. 1. 1   Approval for Day-trading Accounts (FINRA Rule 2130)
                                    Member firms that promote day-trading strategies must now implement procedures to
                                 approve day-trading accounts.
                                    Before opening an account for a non-institutional customer, the member must:
                                 ■■ provide the customer with a risk disclosure statement that outlines all the risks associated
                                    with day trading (the statement can be furnished in writing or electronically); and
                                 ■■ approve the account for a day trading strategy or receive from the customer a written state-
                                    ment that the customer does not intend to engage in day trading.

                                     To approve a customer account for a day trading strategy, the member must have reason-
                                 able grounds for believing that the day trading strategy is appropriate for the customer. In mak-
                                 ing this determination, a member must gather essential facts about the customer, including:
                                 ■■ investment objectives, trading experience, and knowledge;
                                 ■■ financial status (income, liquid net worth, etc.) and tax status; and
                                 ■■ employment status, marital status, number of dependents, and age.

                                     If a member who promotes a day trading strategy opens an account and receives written
                                 assurance that the customer does not intend to engage in day trading—and later determines
                                 that the customer is day trading—it must approve the account within 10 days.
                                     A firm will not be deemed to be promoting a day trading strategy if it promotes lower
                                 execution costs based on multiple trades and has a website that allows multiple entry of intra-
                                 day trades of the same securities.


                        3. 1. 1. 2   Day-trading Risk Disclosure Statement (FINRA Rule 2270)
                                     As previously mentioned, member firms that promote day-trading strategy are obligated
                                 to caution their non-institutional customers as to the risks involved. The firm must provide
                                 to each separate customer a disclosure statement as well as conspicuously posting it on the
                                 member’s website.

                                                          Sample Risk Disclosure Statement
                          You should consider the following points before engaging in a day-trading strategy. For pur-
                     poses of this notice, a “day-trading strategy” means an overall trading strategy characterized by
                     the regular transmission by a customer of intra-day orders to effect both purchase and sale transac-
                     tions in the same security or securities.

                          Day trading can be extremely risky. Day trading generally is not appropriate for someone of
                     limited resources and limited investment or trading experience and low risk tolerance. You should
                     be prepared to lose all of the funds that you use for day trading. In particular, you should not fund
                     day-trading activities with retirement savings, student loans, second mortgages, emergency funds,
                     funds set aside for purposes such as education or home ownership, or funds required to meet your
                     living expenses. Further, certain evidence indicates that an investment of less than $50,000 will
                     significantly impair the ability of a day trader to make a profit. Of course, an investment of $50,000
                     or more will in no way guarantee success.

                          Be cautious of claims of large profits from day trading. You should be wary of advertisements
                     or other statements that emphasize the potential for large profits in day trading. Day trading also
                     can lead to large and immediate financial losses.

                         Day trading requires knowledge of securities markets. Day trading requires in-depth knowl-
                     edge of the securities markets and trading techniques and strategies. In attempting to profit
                     through day trading, you must compete with professional, licensed traders employed by securities
                     firms. You should have appropriate experience before engaging in day trading.

                          Day trading requires knowledge of a firm’s operations. You should be familiar with a securities
                     firm’s business practices, including the operation of the firm’s order execution systems and proce-
                     dures. Under certain market conditions, you may find it difficult or impossible to liquidate a position
                     quickly at a reasonable price. This can occur, for example, when the market for a stock suddenly
                     drops, or if trading is halted due to recent news events or unusual trading activity. The more volatile
                     a stock is, the greater the likelihood that problems may be encountered in executing a transaction.
                     In addition to normal market risks, you may experience losses due to system failures.

                          Day trading will generate substantial commissions, even if the per-trade cost is low. Day
                     trading involves aggressive trading, and generally you will pay commissions on each trade. The
                     total daily commissions that you pay on your trades will add to your losses or significantly reduce
                     your earnings. For instance, assuming that a trade costs $16 and an average of 29 transactions are
                     conducted per day, an investor would need to generate an annual profit of $111,360 just to cover
                     commission expenses.

                          Day trading on margin or short selling may result in losses beyond your initial investment.
                     When you day trade with funds borrowed from a firm or someone else, you can lose more than
                     the funds you originally placed at risk. A decline in the value of the securities that are purchased
                     may require you to provide additional funds to the firm to avoid the forced sale of those securities
                     or other securities in your account. Short selling as part of your day-trading strategy also may lead
                     to extraordinary losses, because you may have to purchase a stock at a very high price in order to
                     cover a short position.

                          Potential Registration Requirements. Persons providing investment advice for others or man-
                     aging securities accounts for others may need to register as either an “Investment Adviser” under
                     the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 or as a “Broker” or “Dealer” under the Securities Exchange
                     Act of 1934. Such activities also may trigger state registration requirements.

                        3. 1. 1. 3   Margin Account Disclosure
                                      Those investors who choose to trade securities through a margin account face additional
                                 risks that must be disclosed to those opening such an account. No member firm is permitted
                                 to open a margin account for a non-institutional account without the firm furnishing the
                                 customer a margin disclosure statement. If the account is open online, or to execute transac-

                                                        Sample Margin Disclosure Statement
                         Your brokerage firm is furnishing this document to you to provide some basic facts about
                     purchasing securities on margin, and to alert you to the risks involved with trading securities in a
                     margin account. Before trading stocks in a margin account, you should carefully review the margin
                     agreement provided by your firm. Consult your firm regarding any questions or concerns you may
                     have with your margin accounts.

                           When you purchase securities, you may pay for the securities in full or you may borrow part
                     of the purchase price from your brokerage firm. If you choose to borrow funds from your firm, you
                     will open a margin account with the firm. The securities purchased are the firm’s collateral for the
                     loan to you. If the securities in your account decline in value, so does the value of the collateral
                     supporting your loan; and, as a result, the firm can take action, such as issue a margin call and/or
                     sell securities or other assets in any of your accounts held with the member, in order to maintain the
                     required equity in the account.

                         It is important that you fully understand the risks involved in trading securities on margin.
                     These risks include the following:

                         ■ You can lose more funds than you deposit in the margin account. A decline in the value of
                     securities that are purchased on margin may require you to provide additional funds to the firm that
                     has made the loan to avoid the forced sale of those securities or other securities or assets in your
                     account(s).

                          ■ The firm can force the sale of securities or other assets in your account(s). If the equity
                     in your account falls below the maintenance margin requirements, or the firm’s higher “house”
                     requirements, the firm can sell the securities or other assets in any of your accounts held at the firm
                     to cover the margin deficiency. You also will be responsible for any short fall in the account after
                     such a sale.

                          ■ The firm can sell your securities or other assets without contacting you. Some investors
                     mistakenly believe that a firm must contact them for a margin call to be valid, and that the firm
                     cannot liquidate securities or other assets in their accounts to meet the call unless the firm has con-
                     tacted them first. This is not the case. Most firms will attempt to notify their customers of margin
                     calls, but they are not required to do so. However, even if a firm has contacted a customer and
                     provided a specific date by which the customer can meet a margin call, the firm can still take neces-
                     sary steps to protect its financial interests, including immediately selling the securities without notice
                     to the customer.

                          ■ You are not entitled to choose which securities or other assets in your account(s) are liq-
                     uidated or sold to meet a margin call. Because the securities are collateral for the margin loan, the
                     firm has the right to decide which security to sell in order to protect its interests.

                          ■ The firm can increase its “house” maintenance margin requirements at any time and is
                     not required to provide you advance written notice. These changes in firm policy often take effect
                     immediately and may result in the issuance of a maintenance margin call. Your failure to satisfy the
                     call may cause the member to liquidate or sell securities in your account(s).

                         ■ You are not entitled to an extension of time on a margin call. While an extension of time to
                     meet margin requirements may be available to customers under certain conditions, a customer does
                     not have a right to the extension.

                                           In addition to the disclosure at the opening of a margin account, the member firm
                                       must at least annually (calendar year) deliver the disclosure again, or alternatively a
                                       somewhat truncated list of the following cautions, to non-institutional customers with
                                       an open margin account.
                                       Securities purchased on margin are the firm’s collateral for the loan to you. If the securities in
                                your account decline in value, so does the value of the collateral supporting your loan; and, as a
                                result, the firm can take action, such as issue a margin call and/or sell securities or other assets in
                                any of your accounts held with the member, in order to maintain the required equity in the account.
                                It is important that you fully understand the risks involved in trading securities on margin. These
                                risks include the following:

                                    ■ You can lose more funds than you deposit in the margin account.

                                    ■ The firm can force the sale of securities or other assets in your account(s).

                                    ■ The firm can sell your securities or other assets without contacting you.

                                    ■ You are not entitled to choose which securities or other assets in your account(s) are liqui-
                                dated or sold to meet a margin call.

                                    ■ The firm can increase its “house” maintenance margin requirements at any time and is not
                                required to provide you advance written notice.

                                           Those investors seeking to trade during extended trading hours need to be cautioned
                                       about the risks associated with that trading practice. No member may permit a customer to
                                       trade in extended hours unless they have received a disclosure statement in the same fashion
                                       as previously stated.

       168         Unit 3   Supervision of Retail and Institutional Customer-Related Activities



                                                    Sample Trading Risk Disclosure Statement
                         You should consider the following points before engaging in extended-hours trading.
                     “Extended-hours trading” means trading outside of “regular trading hours.” “Regular trading
                     hours” generally means the time between 9:30 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time.

                           ■ Risk of Lower Liquidity. Liquidity refers to the ability of market participants to buy and
                     sell securities. Generally, the more orders that are available in a market, the greater the liquidity.
                     Liquidity is important, because with greater liquidity, it is easier for investors to buy or sell securi-
                     ties, and as a result, investors are more likely to pay or receive a competitive price for securities
                     purchased or sold. There may be lower liquidity in extended hours trading as compared to regular
                     trading hours. As a result, your order may only be partially executed, or not at all.

                          ■ Risk of Higher Volatility. Volatility refers to the changes in price that securities undergo when
                     trading. Generally, the higher the volatility of a security, the greater its price swings. There may be
                     greater volatility in extended hours trading than in regular trading hours. As a result, your order
                     may only be partially executed, or not at all, or you may receive an inferior price when engaging in
                     extended hours trading than you would during regular trading hours.

                          ■ Risk of Changing Prices. The prices of securities traded in extended hours trading may not
                     reflect the prices either at the end of regular trading hours, or upon the opening the next morning.
                     As a result, you may receive an inferior price when engaging in extended hours trading than you
                     would during regular trading hours.

                           ■ Risk of Unlinked Markets. Depending on the extended hours trading system or the time
                     of day, the prices displayed on a particular extended hours trading system may not reflect the
                     prices in other concurrently operating extended hours trading systems dealing in the same securi-
                     ties. Accordingly, you may receive an inferior price in one extended hours trading system than you
                     would in another extended hours trading system.

                         ■ Risk of News Announcements. Normally, issuers make news announcements that may affect
                     the price of their securities after regular trading hours. Similarly, important financial information is
                     frequently announced outside of regular trading hours. In extended hours trading, these announce-
                     ments may occur during trading, and if combined with lower liquidity and higher volatility, may
                     cause an exaggerated and unsustainable effect on the price of a security.

                         ■ Risk of Wider Spreads. The spread refers to the difference in price for which you can buy a
                     security and for which you can sell it. Lower liquidity and higher volatility in extended hours trading
                     may result in wider-than-normal spreads for a particular security.




                                   Member firms may use the previous sample, but the firm also may create its own form if it
                                covers at least these six risks.

                  3. 1. 2               ACCOUNT VERIFICATION/USA PATRIOT ACT
                                           Under provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act, broker-dealers are required to:
                                        ■■ verify the identity of any new customer;
                                        ■■ maintain records of the information used to verify identity; and
                                        ■■ determine whether the person appears on any list of known or suspected terrorists or ter-
                                           rorist organizations.

                                            These rules are designed to prevent, detect, and prosecute money laundering and the
                                        financing of terrorism.

                                                            Under the USA PATRIOT Act, records relating to the verification of customers’
                                                        identity must be retained for five years.

                                            As part of its customer identification program (CIP), a broker-dealer must, before opening
                                        an account, obtain the following information at a minimum:
                                        ■■ Customer name
                                        ■■ Date of birth
                                        ■■ Address
                                        ■■ An identification number (e.g., SSN)

                                             An exception is granted to persons who do not currently have, but who have applied for,
                                        a Social Security number. The firm, in this instance, must obtain the number within a reason-
                                        able time.
                                             The firm also must verify the identity of each new customer. Obtaining a copy of the
                                        person’s unexpired drivers license, a copy of a valid passport, or a military ID suffices. For
                                        non-U.S. citizens, an alien registration card or passport will suffice. Further, the firm must
                                        determine whether the customer’s name appears on any list of known or suspected terrorists by
                                        contacting the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC).
                                             New customers must be advised, before the account is opened, that the firm is requesting
                                        information to verify their identities. This notification may be placed on the firm’s website,
                                        delivered verbally, or placed on the new account form.
                                             For a person other than an individual (corporation, partnership, trust, et cetera) a member
                                        must obtain documents showing the existence of the entity, such as articles of incorporation, a
                                        partnership agreement, a trust instrument, or a government-issued business license.
                                             Note that a birth certificate is not a valid means to verify an individual’s identity, because
                                        it does not contain a photograph or address. In addition, the name on the certificate may have
                                        changed due to marriage or otherwise.

                                                            Firms must verify a customer’s identity within a reasonable time before or after

                                                        unable to verify identity. The SEC does say, however, that a firm’s written supervisory
                                                        procedures must state what it will do in this situation.

                                     In addition, each retail customer who opens a new account must, within 30 days of the
                                opening of the account, be furnished with a copy of the account record. This is to ensure
                                that the information obtained by the firm, particularly suitability information, is correct. The
                                firm must send a copy of the account record to customers at least every 36 months thereaf-

                                record within 30 days of receiving notice of the change.
                                     A broker-dealer is required to retain records of all of the identification information
                                obtained from the customer for five years after the account is closed.
                                     By contrast, records made about the information actually verifying a customer’s identity
                                have to be retained for only five years after the record is made.
                                     In every other respect, records of the customer’s account must be maintained pursuant to
                                the provisions of SEC recordkeeping rules 17a-3 and 17a-4.

                    EXAMPLE                              Verification of signatures is critically important with regard to third-party wire
                                                   orders. For instance, if a customer sends an email seeking a wire transfer of funds to a
                                                   third party in Mumbai, India that contained a signed wire transfer form, the represen-
                                                   tative or his assistant should witness the customer affixing his signature and examine
                                                   the customer’s government-issued ID to authenticate the customer’s signature. Failure
                                                   to do so, or something equally convincing, could leave the firm and customer greatly
                                                   exposed. If the customer’s account was hacked, the funds sent to the third party are
                                                   likely gone forever. The careful monitoring of third-party transfers of funds or securi-

                                                   Failure to do so could lead to sanctions for failure to enforce WSPs, as well as violat-

       3. 1. 3                  CHARGES FOR SERVICES
                                    Charges for services—including miscellaneous services, such as the collection of interest
                                or dividends, safekeeping or custody of securities, and the exchange or transfer of securities—
                                must be reasonable and cannot be discriminatory among customers.
                                    There are two services for which members cannot charge customers. First, a member may
                                not charge a customer for research. Providing research for a price would force the member to
                                register as an investment adviser with the SEC for those who manage $110 million or more
                                (with a state securities agency if it is less than $100 million, and with either if in between).
                                Second, a member may not charge a customer for forwarding proxy material. Members charge
                                the issuer for providing this service.

                  3. 1. 4               HOLDING CUSTOMER MAIL (FINRA RULE 3150)
                                            A member firm may hold mail for a customer who will not be receiving mail at his or her
                                        usual address, provided that:
                                        ■■ the member receives written instructions from the customer that include the time period
                                            during which the member is requested to hold the customer’s mail.
                                        ■■ If the requested time period included in the instructions is longer than three consecutive
                                            months, the customer’s instructions must include an acceptable reason for the request
                                            (e.g., safety or security concerns).

                                           The member under FINRA Rule 3150 is obligated to:
                                        ■■ inform customers in writing of any alternate methods, such as email or access through
                                           the member’s website, that customers may use to receive or monitor account activity and
                                           information; and
                                        ■■ obtain confirmation of the receipt of such information from customers; and
                                        ■■ the member verifies at reasonable intervals that the customer’s instructions still apply.
                                        ■■ During the time that a member is holding mail for a customer, the member must be able to
                                           communicate with the customer in a timely manner to provide important account infor-
                                           mation, such as privacy notices.
                                        ■■ A member holding a customer’s mail must take actions reasonably designed to ensure that
                                           the customer’s mail is not tampered with, held without the customer’s consent, or used by
                                           an AP of the member in any manner that would violate rules and the securities laws.

                  3. 1. 5               THIRD-PARTY TRADING
                                             In most accounts, there are two parties: (1) the customer (the account owner), and (2)
                                        the member firm executing orders entered by the customer. In a third-party account, someone
                                        other than, or in addition to, the customer is authorized to enter orders. A fiduciary account
                                        is an example of a third-party account (discussed later in this Unit). The fiduciary is the third
                                        party (in addition to the account owner and the member firm) authorized under state law to
                                        trade the account. Discretionary accounts are another example of third-party trading.
                                             In a discretionary account, the account owner gives the member trading authorization. To
                                        do so, the customer signs a power of attorney. This authorization may be revoked by the cus-
                                        tomer in writing, at any time, and ends on the death or mental incompetence of the customer.

                                    Third-party trading can be limited or full. Limited authorization allows the third party to
                                enter orders only. Full authorization allows order entry and permits the authorized party to
                                withdraw funds from the account. Any disbursements must be in the account name, not in the
                                name of the authorized third party.
                                    A trade is discretionary if the member chooses any of the following order-related items:
                                    • Action (buy or sell)
                                    • Asset (the security to be bought or sold)
                                    • Amount (number of shares or dollar amount)

                                    If the member chooses the price or timing of an order, it is not discretionary; rather, it is
                                termed a not held order.

                                    Discretionary authority must be approved by a principal before its exercise. In addition, a

                                quently review all discretionary accounts to detect potential abuses, such as unsuitable trades
                                or churning (discussed later in this Unit).

                                    At minimum, a confirmation must contain the following information:

                                ■■ The identity of the shares or units as well as the price and number of shares (if the trade
                                    price on the confirmation is incorrect, the actual price prevails)
                                ■■ Whether the member acted as dual agent (dual agency occurs when a firm crosses stock
                                    between two customers, charging each side a commission)

                                    FINRA allows members to electronically send documents, such as confirmations and
                                account statements, to customers as long as certain conditions are met. To do so, the firm must
                                have procedures in place to show that the information sent has been delivered as intended
                                and that the confidentiality and security of personal information are protected. Furthermore,
                                customers must provide written consent to electronic delivery.
                                    In addition, a customer who consents to receive information and documents electronically
                                must be provided with the information in paper form, upon request.

                                                        While many firms also include information on whether the trade was solicited or
                                                   unsolicited, the SEC does not require such disclosure. Copies of customer confirma-

       3. 1. 8                  CUSTOMER ACCOUNT TRANSFER CONTRACTS
                                     When a customer whose securities account is carried by a member (the carrying member)
                                wants to transfer the account to another member (the receiving member), the customer must
                                sign an account transfer form. Upon receipt from a customer of a broker-to-broker transfer
                                instruction form (TIF), the receiving member must immediately submit the instruction to the
                                carrying member in ACATS (Automated Customer Account Transfer Service). Customers
                                may choose to move assets to another firm for a wide variety of reasons: better or wider variety
                                of services, lower costs, or simply a brother-in-law is now a broker at the receiving firm. It may
                                also be that the customer has learned the broker is under investigation by regulators or has
                                apparently committed rule violations in connection with the account. Whatever the reason,
                                we must respect the transfer instructions.
                                     The carrying member must, within one business day following the receipt of the TIF from
                                the customer, validate the transfer instruction to the receiving member.
                                     Within three business days following the validation of the transfer instruction, the carry-
                                ing member must complete the transfer of the customer’s security account assets to the receiv-
                                ing member. In short, that’s one day validate, three days ship. If the asset is non-transferable,
                                the firm has five business days to send the proceeds from liquidation.
                                     When the transfer take place, the receiving member and the carrying member must imme-
                                diately establish fail-to-receive and fail-to-deliver contracts at then-current market values
                                upon their respective books of account against the long/short positions, including options,
                                that have not been delivered/received, and the receiving/carrying member must debit/credit
                                the related money amount.

                                            For purposes of this rule, customer authorization could be the customer’s actual signature

                                            The carrying member, within one business day following receipt, must validate and return

                                        positions.
                                                The carrying firm may take exception to the transfer instruction if:
                                        ■■ the account is flat and reflects no transferable assets;
                                        ■■ the account number is invalid;
                                        ■■ the Social Security number on the instruction does not match the number on the carrying

                                                         deny validation because of a dispute over securities positions or the money balance in

                                            Both firms must promptly (within five business days) resolve any exceptions taken.
                                            Upon validation, the carrying member must freeze the account and refuse any new orders.
                                        In addition, all open orders, such as stops or limits, must be canceled. The only exception to
                                        the acceptance of new orders is option positions, which expire within seven business days.
                                            Within three business days following validation, the carrying firm must complete the
                                        transfer of the account. If any positions are not transferred to the receiving firm due to a fail to
                                        receive at the carrying firm, fail to receive and fail to deliver contracts must be established by
                                        the members. Fail contracts, dealer to dealer, are discussed later.
                                            Certain assets are nontransferable. These include proprietary products, such as unit trusts
                                        managed by the carrying firm. In these situations, the customer can retain these assets at
                                        the carrying firm or liquidate and have the resulting cash balance transferred. The securities
                                        underlying when-issued contracts are subject to delayed delivery. Rather than transfer the
                                        contract, the carrying firm retains the contract until the underlying securities are issued. At
                                        this point, the securities are transferred. Also note that partial transfers are acceptable. For
                                        example, a customer could elect to transfer only his equity securities, leaving the remainder at
                                        the carrying firm.
                                            It is a violation to interfere with a customer’s request to transfer an account in connection
                                        with the change in employment of the customer’s registered representative where the account
                                        is not subject to any lien.
                                            A bulk transfer (sometimes called a “block” transfer) of customer accounts is permitted
                                        in certain circumstances. Assume, for example, that Firm A, the newly appointed sponsor of

                  3. 1. 9               DEATH OF A CUSTOMER
                                            With regard to individual accounts, once a member becomes aware of the death of the
                                        account owner, the member must cancel all open orders, mark the account Deceased, and
                                        freeze the assets in the account until receiving instructions and documentation from the exec-
                                        utor of the decedent’s estate. If the account has a third-party power of attorney, the authoriza-
                                        tion is revoked.

                                   The documents necessary to release the assets of a decedent are:
                                ■■ certified copy of the death certificate;
                                ■■ inheritance tax waivers; and
                                ■■ letters testamentary.

                                    If one party in a JTWROS account dies, the account cannot be transferred into the name
                                of the new owner (the other party) until the member receives a certified copy of the death
                                certificate.
                                    If one party in a TIC account dies, the decedent’s interest in the account goes to his estate.
                                The executor for the decedent must present the proper documents before the assets belonging
                                to the decedent can be released. In some states, the death of a tenant in a TIC account requires
                                that the executor present an affidavit of domicile to the member, which shows the decedent’s
                                estate will be handled under the laws of that state.

                                                       In TIC accounts, the death of a tenant requires that the member firm freeze
                                                   the account and acceptance of orders until the required documents are presented.
                                                   Compare this with a JTWROS account, in which the death of one tenant does not
                                                   preclude the remaining tenant from entering orders.

                                     With regard to partnership accounts, if one partner dies, the member needs written author-
                                ity from the remaining partners before executing any further orders. This written authorization
                                generally takes the form of an amended partnership agreement.

                  3. 1. 10 COMPONENTS OF SUITABILITY OBLIGATIONS
                           (FINRA RULE 2111)
                                   Under FINRA Rule 2111, there are three main obligations:
                                ■■ Reasonable-basis suitability
                                ■■ Customer-specific suitability
                                ■■ Quantitative suitability

                                     The reasonable-basis obligation requires a member firm or AP to have a reasonable basis
                                to believe, having applied reasonable diligence, that a recommendation is suitable for at least
                                some investors. What constitutes reasonable diligence varies depending on the complexity
                                and risks associated with the security or investment strategy. It also depends on the member’s
                                or AP’s familiarity with the security or investment strategy. Reasonable diligence must lead to
                                recognizing the potential risks and rewards associated with the recommended security or strat-
                                egy by the AP and member. Inability to distinguish and explain the risks when recommending
                                a security or strategy violates the suitability rule.
                                     The customer-specific obligation requires a member or AP to have a reasonable basis to
                                believe that the recommendation is suitable for a particular customer based on that customer’s
                                investment profile. For example, an elderly person who previously may have had a remarkable
                                degree of sophistication but now shows signs of diminished capacity, would require the greatest
                                supervisory care if a representative should offer for consideration a fixed-income product, such
                                as a reverse convertible note or bond. As a principal, you would demand an explanation as to
                                why this security is right for this particular customer.
                                     Quantitative suitability requires a member or AP who has control over a customer account
                                to have a reasonable basis for believing that a series of recommended transactions, even if suit-
                                able when viewed in isolation, are not excessive and unsuitable for the customer when taken
                                together. No single test defines excessive activity; however, factors such as the turnover rate,
                                the cost-equity ratio, and the use of in-and-out trading in a customer’s account may provide
                                a basis for a finding that a member or AP has violated the quantitative suitability obligation.


                  3. 1. 11 SUITABILITY INFORMATION
                                    The registered representative must attempt to collect suitability information, which is the
                                information necessary to be able to make suitable recommendations for a customer. Inquiry
                                should be made as to the customer’s income, net worth (excluding value of a primary resi-
                                dence), tax status, number of dependents, investment objectives, risk tolerance, time horizon,
                                and other holdings. Should the customer fail to provide this information, the account still may
                                be opened but no recommendations can be made.
                                    The only signature required on the form is that of the principal accepting (approving) the
                                account.

                                                     There is no requirement for the customer’s signature. However, do not let indus-
                                                try practice get in the way of answering a signature question correctly. Most members
                                                include a W-9 and a predispute arbitration agreement as part of the new account

                                                separate from the new account form itself. Non-US citizens must sign form W-8.

       3. 1. 12 UNIQUE SUITABILITY ISSUES
                                     All recommendations to customers must be suitable based on investment objectives, risk
                                tolerance, and related information. There are situations, however, that require separate disclo-
                                sure, a written suitability determination, or both.
                                     If a member firm or its associates recommends a security through a social media site, such as
                                Facebook or MySpace, it triggers FINRA Rule 2111 regarding suitability.
                                     Whether a particular post on a website is a recommendation for a security will depend on
                                the facts and circumstances. The Series 24 examination tests candidates’ ability to make judg-
                                ment calls on limited facts and circumstances.
                                     Here are a few examples. A web-based communication that would fall outside the definition
                                of a recommendation would be if a member firm created a website available to customers that
                                have an electronic library containing research reports, which may include buy-sell recommenda-
                                tions as well as news, quotes, and charts that customers may request. The facts indicate this is not
                                a recommendation, and suitability rules are not triggered.
                                     An example of communication that falls within the definition of a recommendation under
                                the rule would be a member that sends a targeted email or pop-up screen to a customer or tar-
                                geted group of customers encouraging them to buy a security.
                                     Another example of a recommendation would include a member that sends its customers an
                                email stating that they should invest in stocks from a particular industry sector and urges custom-
                                ers to buy stocks from a list.
                                     As you can see, it can be a challenge to identify when a recommendation is made triggering
                                suitability concerns. Compliance officers must consider many factors when developing proce-
                                dures and best practices for the member firm’s WSPs in supervising the use of social media sites
                                that recommend specific investment products.
                                     As a best practice, compliance officers might consider prohibiting all interactive electronic
                                communications that recommend a specific investment product and any link to a recommenda-
                                tion unless a thoroughly trained and qualified registered principal has granted prior approval of
                                the content. In addition, some member firms maintain libraries of previously approved commu-
                                nications to which their representatives have regular access. Compliance officers might consider
                                prohibiting communications that recommend specific investments unless the communication
                                matches a preapproved template and the recommendation has been approved by a registered
                                principal.

                                             Regulation S-P, mandated by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, requires that firms take iden-
                                        tity theft seriously and have adequate safeguards in the form of privacy policies to protect
                                        nonpublic personal information from unauthorized access or use. Member firms must provide
                                        an initial privacy notice to new customers when an account is opened and must provide an
                                        annual privacy notice to all customers. Regulation S-P permits firms to disclose nonpublic per-
                                        sonal information to unaffiliated third parties unless the customer has elected to opt out of the
                                        disclosure. Examples of nonpublic personal information include a customer’s Social Security
                                        number, account balances, transaction history, the fact that the individual was at one time a
                                        customer, and any information collected through a consumer reporting agency or an internet
                                        cookie.

                                                             An Internet cookie is created with the view to allow the member firm to collect
                                                        information about the customer and is an example that illustrates one of the many
                                                        ways that any financial institution may obtain information about a consumer in con-
                                                        nection with providing a financial product or service to that specific consumer. If the
                                                        information is not specific, it is known as “blind data” or aggregate information that
                                                        contains no personal identifiers. It is not deemed to be personally identifiable informa-
                                                        tion and, therefore, not subject to Regulation S-P requirements.

                                            Regulation S-P distinguishes between a consumer and a customer. A consumer is an indi-
                                        vidual who obtains a financial product or service from a firm and has no further contact with
                                        the firm. A customer is an individual who has an ongoing relationship with a firm. Consumers
                                        are given an initial privacy notice only, while customers must be given both an initial and
                                        annual privacy notice.
                                            Regulation S-P also requires members to adopt policies and procedures that provide ade-
                                        quate safeguards of confidential customer information and records. Not a month goes by with-
                                        out a headline of a major break in security at a large company. Technological advancements,
                                        such as Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi), present many confidentiality issues for firms. Among the
                                        many security concerns is that data are broadcast out into the airwaves, making intercep-
                                        tion easier. Wireless connections present an attractive mechanism for hackers to tap into the
                                        user’s workstation to gain access to the corporate network. Before permitting brokers to access
                                        customer information remotely, members must implement and update appropriate measures
                                        to secure customer information. These measures may need to go far beyond a firewall and off-

                                                       Reasonable opt-out methods available to members include providing a reply form

                                transactions from an affiliate company, to make a marketing solicitation to a prospective cus-

                                    of receiving the marketing solicitations; and
                                ■■ the consumer has not opted out.

                                   This regulation also applies to investment companies, investment advisers, and transfer
                                agents registered with the Commission.


       3. 1. 15 FAIR AND ACCURATE CREDIT TRANSACTIONS ACT OF
                2003 (FACT ACT)
                                    The Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (FACT Act) requires that each
                                financial institution or creditor develop and implement a written program to detect, prevent,
                                and mitigate identity theft in connection with the opening of certain accounts or the mainte-
                                nance of certain existing accounts (referred to as the Red Flags Rule). In addition, it requires
                                that card issuers assess the validity of change-of-address notifications and that each user of
                                consumer reports develop reasonable policies and procedures to respond to the receipt of a
                                consumer reporting agency’s notice of a consumer address discrepancy.



       3. 1. 16 CUSTOMER ACCOUNT STATEMENTS
                                    Members are required to send statements to customers at least quarterly. If there is activity
                                in the account in any given month, a statement must be sent that month. Activity is defined
                                as purchases, sales, interest or dividends received, or any funds flowing in or out of the account.
                                    The SEC has a related rule regarding notification of free credit balances (cash balances)
                                in customer accounts. Free credit balances are a rarity, as most firms provide automatic sweep
                                into a money market fund or bank sweep program of any cash balances in customer accounts
                                awaiting reinvestment. However, the SEC requires that customers be notified of any free credit
                                balance in their accounts at least quarterly or whenever a statement is sent. This notification

                                        must state that free credit balances are not segregated by the member firm, that they may be
                                        used by the member in the conduct of its business, and that they are available to the customer
                                        on demand.
                                            In addition, each general securities member must include in the account statement an
                                        advisory that the customer should promptly report any inaccuracy or discrepancy in that per-
                                        son’s account to his brokerage firm. In cases where the customer’s account is serviced by both
                                        an introducing and a clearing firm, each general securities member must include in the advi-
                                        sory a reference that such reports should be made to both firms.

                                                        pany Act of 1940. If customers are provided with a bank sweep program, the method
                                                        for determining interest rate the customer may expect must be disclosed along with

                                            Nevertheless, the SEC (under Rule 15c3-2) requires that customers be notified of any
                                        free credit balance in their accounts at least quarterly or whenever a statement is sent. This
                                        notification must state that:
                                        ■■ these balances are not segregated by the member firm;
                                        ■■ they may be used by the member in the conduct of its business; and
                                        ■■ they are available to the customer on demand.

                                            Customer account statements must include a statement advising customers to promptly
                                        report any discrepancy or inaccuracy to her brokerage firm and clearing firm.

                                ■■ buy back the securities for the original consideration paid; and

                                    Offers of rescission must be accepted or rejected by the customer within 30 days of receipt.

       3. 1. 18 FORWARDING OF PROXY MATERIALS
                                    Member firms must cooperate with issuers by ensuring that customers whose stock is held
                                in street name are alerted to all financial matters concerning issuers (e.g., quarterly reports,
                                proxy statements). To do so, members act as forwarding agents for all proxies and other corpo-
                                rate materials received from an issuer for street name stock.
                                    Member firms that are owners of record must vote street name stock in accordance with
                                the wishes of the beneficial owners. If a customer signs and returns a proxy statement and fails
                                to indicate how the shares are to be voted, the member must vote the shares as recommended
                                by management.
                                    If a customer does not return the proxy by the 10th day before the annual shareholders
                                meeting, the member may vote the shares as it sees fit as long as the matters to be voted on
                                are of minor importance. If the matters to be voted on are of major importance (e.g., merger,
                                issuance of additional securities), the member may never vote the shares as it sees fit. In this
                                case, if the proxy is not returned, the shares are not voted.
                                    Member firms are reimbursed by issuers for all costs relating to the forwarding of proxy
                                materials. Such costs include postage and related clerical expenses.

                                    This policy applies to non-exempt securities in both the OTC and the exchange markets.
                                It does not apply to exempt securities, such as municipal bonds. It also does not apply to pro-
                                spectus offerings. If a member is required to give a customer a prospectus in any transaction,
                                that transaction is outside the scope of the 5% policy (e.g., new issues, mutual funds, variable
                                annuities, and direct participation programs).
                                    When a dealer sells a security to a customer, the price paid by the customer included the
                                dealer’s mark-up. When the dealer buys a stock or bond from a customer, the dealer marks
                                down the security, which reduces the money that the customer receives. The amount of the
                                mark-up and mark-down is calculated from the prevailing market price of the security. It is

                                incumbent upon the dealer to charge an amount that is fair and reasonable. The price must
                                be reasonably related to the current market price of the security. Charging excessive mark-ups
                                and not disclosing this to the customer is deemed fraudulent and is a violation of Securities
                                Exchange Act of 1934.
                                    There is an exemption from this rule. Namely, if the customer is a Qualified Institutional
                                Buyer (QIB) who can independently evaluate risks, and the security is non-investment grade,
                                the broker-dealer may make transactions that are exempt from FINRA Rule 2121.

                                                   The 5% policy applies to both agency and principal transactions. It applies to
                                                markups, markdowns, and commissions but not to securities sold by prospectus.

                                     In assessing the fairness of a member’s commission and markup practices, FINRA consid-
                                ers the following factors.
                                ■■ Type of security. In general, there is more market risk associated with making markets and
                                     trading in common stocks than in bonds (assuming the bonds are nonconvertible). The
                                     more risk a member must assume, the greater the justification for higher markups.
                                ■■ Availability. An inactively traded stock would command a higher markup than an actively
                                     traded stock.
                                ■■ Price. The percentage markup should decrease as the selling price of a stock increases.
                                ■■ Dollar amount. The greater the dollar amount, the lower the percentage markup.
                                ■■ Pattern of markups. Although FINRA is concerned primarily with detecting cases where
                                     a member has established a pattern of excessive markups, a single incident would still be
                                     considered an unfair markup.
                                ■■ Disclosure. In unique situations involving unusual securities or special transactions where
                                     there is little or no precedent for determining the fairness of a commission or markup,
                                     FINRA will look favorably on a member that discloses its fee in advance of the transac-
                                     tion. However, this does not relieve the member of the obligation to keep such fees rea-
                                     sonable and fair.

                                   Markups and markdowns are computed from the prevailing market price at time of sale.
                                This price is a function of the market environment in which the security trades.
                                   FINRA has identified three types of market environments in which market makers operate:
                                ■■ Active, competitive markets
                                ■■ Inactive, competitive markets
                                ■■ Dominated and controlled markets

                                     In an active, competitive market, the prevailing market price is the inside market at time
                                of sale.

                    EXAMPLE                             There are four market makers in XYZZ as follows:




                                                                     Market Maker 1

                                                                                                          Ask
                                                                                                          31.30
                                                                     Market Maker 2               31.25   31.50
                                                                     Market Maker 3               31.10   31.45
                                                                     Market Maker 4               31.25   31.45

                                                       If Market Maker 2 were to sell 100 shares of XYZZ to a customer at 31.80 net,
                                                   the amount of the markup would be $.50, computed from the inside offer of 31.30.
                                                   The percentage markup would be 1.6% (.50 ÷ 31.30).
                                                       If Market Maker 3 bought 100 shares of XYZZ from a customer at 30.70 net, the
                                                   amount of the markdown would be $.55, computed from the inside bid of 31.25. The
                                                   percentage markdown would be 1.7% (.55 ÷ 31.25).

                                    In an inactive, competitive market, a market maker must use its contemporaneous (recent)
                                purchases from other dealers as the prevailing market price for markdowns and its contempo-
                                raneous sales to other dealers as the prevailing market price for markups. Because there is
                                relatively little trading activity, the inside market is not a reliable guide. In dominated and
                                controlled markets, market makers must use actual cost, not quotations, as the prevailing mar-
                                ket price for markups and markdowns.
                                    Some other points to remember regarding pricing are as follows.
                                ■■ In the absence of other bona fide evidence, a member’s own contemporaneous cost (price
                                    at which the firm last bought as principal) is the best indication of the prevailing market
                                    price.
                                ■■ When a nonmarket maker sells to a customer in a riskless principal trade, markup is com-
                                    puted from the member’s cost.
                                                                   Summary Chart of Prevailing Market Price

                                    Proceeds Transaction. The 5% policy also is applicable to a proceeds transaction. A
                                proceeds transaction is one in which a customer enters an order to sell and instructs the
                                registered representative to use the proceeds to make a purchase (i.e., sell this and use the
                                proceeds to buy that). FINRA views a proceeds transaction as a single trade for markup/
                                commission purposes.
                                        To compute percentage markup in a proceeds transaction, a member must:
                                ■■ determine the compensation earned on the sell side;
                                ■■ determine the compensation earned on the buy side; and
                                ■■ add the two and apply the total to the inside market on the buy side (the second trade).

                                         Since mark-ups and mark-downs are calculated from the prevailing market price of the
                                    security, including fixed-income securities, it is critical to get current transaction information.
                                    In the next unit, we will cover TRACE, which serves to provide publically available pricing
                                    information of debt securities.
                                         It is not unusual, however, for a dealer in debt securities to purchase the bonds from a third
                                    party in order to sell it to a customer. This is the dealer’s contemporaneous cost, which serves
                                    as the base point to calculate the mark-up. The contemporaneous cost is deemed to be a highly
                                    reliable indication of the prevailing market price. Keep in mind that this rule is not absolute;
                                    it is more of a guideline. A dealer may make a trade with the view to sell it with a mark-up,
                                    but in the time the dealer is in possession of the bond, news of a credit rating change could
                                    substantially alter the prevailing market price.
                                         Since a firm’s markup or markdown on a corporate debt security with a customer is cal-
                                    culated from the prevailing market price of that security and absent other information to the
                                    contrary, the prevailing market price is the firm’s contemporaneous cost or the firm’s contem-
                                    poraneous proceeds.
                                         A firm may seek to overcome the presumption that its contemporaneous cost (proceeds)
                                    is indicative of the prevailing market price if any one of the following events have occurred.
                                    ■■ Interest rates changed after the contemporaneous transaction to a degree that the pricing
                                         of the bond has changed.
                                    ■■ The credit quality of the bond changed significantly after the contemporaneous transac-
                                         tion.
                                    ■■ News was issued that had an effect on the pricing of the bond.

                                    If none of these factors results in providing a prevailing market price, a firm may then
                                consider the pricing information from similar securities.
                                    A similar debt security is one that has a comparable maturity, call features, credit rating,
                                yield, and public float.

       3. 1. 20                  FAIR DEALING
                                    While sales efforts must be judged by the uniqueness of each member-customer relation-
                                ship, certain actions on the part of registered representatives are not considered fair dealing
                                and may result in disciplinary action by FINRA. A principal, in reviewing trade blotters and
                                customer account activity, should question any of the following.
                                ■■ Blanket recommendations of low-priced securities. It is highly unlikely that speculative
                                    securities will be suitable for all persons solicited. A supervisor who notices on the blotter
                                    that a representative has sold the same stock to a wide variety of different investors would
                                    be expected to inquire as to why this is happening and document the inquiry. It may be
                                    nothing. On the other hand, it may just be a blanket recommendation that would require
                                    corrective action. Failing to notice this fair dealing infraction could lead to disciplinary
                                    action taken against not only the representative but the manager for failing to supervise.
                                ■■ Excessive trading activity. Called churning, excessive trading is difficult to quantify. It
                                    must be judged based on the objectives, risk tolerance, and history of the account. Mak-
                                    ing a profit does not mitigate the offense; the fact that an account generates a profit as the
                                    result of excessive trading is not a valid defense in an arbitration hearing.
                                ■■ Trading in mutual fund shares. By definition, mutual funds are longer-term investment
                                    vehicles, and short-term trading raises questions of churning and suitability.
                                ■■ Recommending purchases beyond the customer’s ability to pay. Frequent sellouts or
                                    trade cancellations can indicate potential problems.

                                   Other prohibited activities include the following:
                                ■■ Setting up fictitious accounts to execute trades otherwise prohibited
                                ■■ Entering orders that are unauthorized by customers or sending confirmations to cause cus-
                                   tomers to accept trades to which they have not agreed
                                ■■ Trading on a discretionary basis without written authorization
                                ■■ Unauthorized use of customer funds or securities
                                ■■ Circulating rumors; spreading false or misleading information that would improperly influ-
                                   ence a security’s market price
                                ■■ Piggybacking (e.g., a broker effecting for an account a transaction that is essentially the
                                   same as effected by a customer on the belief that the customer acted on inside informa-

                            CASE STUDY
                                                         FINRA alleged that from August 2009 through November 2010, Aker Surrey, LLC
                                                    failed to establish and maintain a supervisory system and enforce written supervisory
                                                    procedures reasonably designed to identify and prevent unsuitable excessive trading
                                                    and churning in customer accounts. Specifically, FINRA found that the member firm
                                                    relied entirely on a single exception report with inadequate parameters to identify
                                                    active accounts with patterns of unsuitable and excessive trading. FINRA alleged that
                                                    Aker Surrey had access to its clearing firm’s additional exception reports but that it
                                                    failed to use those reports. Consequently, FINRA concluded that Aker Surrey failed to
                                                    identify at least 49 accounts where 40 of the instances came from a single office. The
                                                    firm provided no guidance on thresholds regarding transaction- or commission-based
                                                    restrictions that should be placed on accounts with significant turnover ratios.



                  3. 1. 21 BREAKPOINT “SALES”
                                    ■■ Breakpoints are quantity discounts: the greater the dollar amount of a purchase, the lower
                                       the sales charge.
                                    ■■ Breakpoint sales, on the other hand, is jargon in the securities industry that means sales just
                                       below the breakpoint in an effort by representatives to share in the higher sales charges
                                       applicable on sales below the breakpoint. This is inconsistent with just and equitable
                                       principles of trade.




                                *
                                EXAMPLE                 The member must advise the customer that, for a few dollars more, the customer
                                                    could qualify for a lower sales charge.


                                    ■■ FINRA does not define near a breakpoint. Therefore, members must make certain that cus-
                                       tomers are advised of a fund’s breakpoint schedule. The rule is in place because members,
                                       and indirectly, registered representatives, could earn more concession dollars on a smaller
                                       customer investment (with a higher sales charge) than on a larger customer investment
                                       (with a smaller sales charge).

                                        Group purchases of shares, such as those made by investment clubs or by multiple clients
                                    (omnibus account) of an investment adviser, do not qualify for breakpoints. Each client will
                                    pay a sales charge based on that client’s purchase amount.


                  3. 1. 22 NET TRANSACTIONS WITH CUSTOMERS
                           (FINRA RULE 2124)
                                        Member firms are required to disclose and obtain consent from a customer prior to execut-
                                    ing a transaction with the customer on a net basis.
                                        A net transaction is a principal transaction in which a market maker, after having received
                                    an order to buy an equity security, purchases the equity security at one price (from another
                                    broker-dealer or another customer) and then sells to the customer at a different price.
                                        For noninstitutional customers, a member must obtain the customer’s written consent on
                                    an order-by-order basis, and such consent must evidence the customer’s understanding of the
                                    terms and conditions of the transaction.

                                     For institutional customers (as defined earlier in this Unit), a member may obtain consent
                                on an order-by-order basis, using one of three methods.
                                     Written consent on an order-by-order basis prior to executing a transaction for or with the
                                customer on a net basis. The consent must evidence the customer’s understanding of the terms
                                and conditions of the order.
                                     A negative consent letter that clearly discloses the terms and conditions for handling
                                the customer order(s) and provides a meaningful opportunity to object to the execution of
                                transactions on a net basis. If the customer does not object, then the member may reasonably
                                conclude that it has consented to the member trading on a “net” basis with the institutional
                                customer. The member may then rely on the letter for all or a portion of the customer’s orders
                                (as instructed by the customer).
                                     Oral disclosure and consent also is available on an order-by-order basis. Oral disclosure
                                and consent must, as previously stated, clearly explain the terms and conditions for handling
                                the customer order and provide the institutional customer with a meaningful opportunity
                                to object to the execution of the transaction on a net basis. The member also must log each
                                order-by-order disclosure.



       3. 2             ANTI-MONEY LAUNDERING REGULATION
                        (FINRA RULE 3310)
                                    Money laundering is a serious crime that involves an effort to conceal the source of ille-
                                gally obtained funds from activities such as trafficking in narcotics and fraud, and attempt-
                                ing to make those funds appear legitimate. Brokerage accounts have been used to this end
                                and continue to be viewed by racketeers, terrorists, and other criminals to launder money.
                                Principals must be diligent in identifying and reporting any attempts by criminals to use bro-
                                kerage accounts for illicit activities. Therefore, among other things, the Bank Secrecy Act
                                (BSA) and FINRA Rule 3310 require all member firms to identify money laundering risks
                                by developing, implementing, and monitoring an effective anti-money laundering (AML)
                                program designed to achieve, not only compliance with the BSA and related regulations, but
                                thwarting the aims of criminals and terrorists.
                                    The firm’s AML program must be approved in writing by a member of senior management
                                as well as any subsequent change to the program. If the approving senior manager leaves the
                                member firm, the AML program should be re-approved by the new manager. Specifically, the
                                rules would require member firms to:
                                ■■ establish and implement policies and procedures that can be reasonably expected to detect
                                    and cause the reporting of transactions that raise suspicion and by identifying red flags that
                                    signal money laundering;
                                ■■ establish and implement policies, procedures, and internal controls reasonably designed to
                                    achieve compliance with the Bank Secrecy;
                                ■■ designate to FINRA an individual or individuals responsible for implementing and moni-
                                    toring the day-to-day operations and internal controls of the program and escalating suspi-
                                    cious activity to appropriate compliance officials;
                                ■■ provide ongoing training for appropriate personnel; and
                                ■■ provide for annual independent testing for compliance by someone qualified to perform

                                    with other broker-dealers, an independent test is required only every two years on a calen-

                                            As we read in an earlier unit, firms are required to designate and identify to FINRA,
                                        through the FINRA Contact System (FCS), the compliance officer charged with oversight of
                                        the firm’s anti-money laundering program. The firm must provide name, title, mailing address,
                                        email address, telephone number, and facsimile number of this contact. If there is a change in
                                        the designation, the firm must provide notification to FINRA within 30 days and then verify
                                        the name(s) within 17 business days after the end of each calendar year.

                                                             FINRA Rule 3310 requires that a member of the firm’s senior management ap-

                                                        Act and its associated regulations. Independent means that testing may not be con-

                                                        anti-money laundering compliance person. Furthermore, it may not be conducted by

                                            There is an exception to the requirement that firms conduct an independent test of its
                                        AML compliance program annually. The exception applies to firms that do not execute trans-
                                        actions for customers or otherwise carry customer accounts and do not act as an introducing
                                        broker. These firms may test once every two years. Examples of firms that may test every two
                                        years are firms engaged solely in merger and acquisition work, firms engaged solely in selling
                                        DPPs, and firms engaged solely in private placements.


                  3. 2. 1               CURRENCY RECEIPT
                                             Brokerage firms do not often accept cash; nevertheless, the Bank Secrecy Act requires
                                        broker-dealers to report, on Form 112, any currency received in the amount of more than
                                        $10,000 on a single day. Though paying for purchased securities with currency is not prohib-
                                        ited, many firms do not permit this. Failure to report can result in fines of up to $500,000, 10
                                        years in prison, or both. Records relating to Form 112 must be retained for five years.
                                             Form 112 must be filed within 15 days of receipt of the currency. This rule is part of the
                                        regulatory effort to address money laundering. The two federal agencies empowered to handle
                                        this abuse are the Federal Reserve and the Department of the Treasury. CTR Form 112 must
                                        be submitted electronically, hosted on a secure website. Keep in mind that legitimate funds
                                        also may be used to fund criminal activities, such as terrorism. Currency receipts are but one
                                        tool to help identify “reverse” laundering, which is funding crime with legitimate funds. AML
                                        laws and rules are written with the view to impede money laundering as well as the financing
                                        of terrorism.

                  3. 2. 2               SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY REPORTS
                                            The USA PATRIOT Act requires firms to report to Financial Crimes Enforcement
                                        Network (FinCEN) when there is an event, transaction, or series of events or transactions
                                        that appear to be questionable. The act requires firms, through their supervisory user, to file
                                        a suspicious activity report (SAR) to FinCEN any transaction that alone or in the aggregate
                                        involves at least $5,000 in funds or other assets if the firm suspects that it falls within one of
                                        the following four classes:
                                        ■■ The transaction involves funds derived from illegal activity
                                        ■■ The transaction is designed to evade the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act
                                        ■■ The transaction appears to serve no business or lawful purpose
                                        ■■ The transaction involves the use of the firm to facilitate criminal activity

                                                        CTR filing, could trigger a suspicious activity report (SAR) filing.




                                                            Structuring refers to handling currency transactions in a way designed to avoid
                                                        reporting requirements.

                                            Firms must file a SAR within 30 days of becoming aware of the suspicious transaction(s).
                                        Copies of each SAR filing and the related documentation must be retained for five years from
                                        the date of the filing.
                                            The act also requires that the filing of a SAR remain confidential. The person involved in
                                        the transaction that is the subject of the report must not be notified. If subpoenaed, the firm
                                        must refuse to provide the information and must notify FinCEN of the request unless the dis-
                                        closure is required by FinCEN, the SEC, an SRO, or other law enforcement authority.
                                            In addition, the USA PATRIOT Act requires firms to make and retain records relating to
                                        wire transfers of $3,000 or more. Information to be collected includes the name and address of
                                        sender and recipient, the amount of the transfer, the name of the recipient’s financial institu-
                                        tion, and the account number of the recipient.
                                            Similar to the CTR, Form 111 must be submitted electronically through the BSA E-Filing

       3. 2. 3                  STAGES OF MONEY LAUNDERING
                                    Placement, layering, and integration are terms used to describe the three stages through
                                which dirty money is laundered. In the placement stage, currency enters the financial sys-
                                tem. When illicit monies are deposited at a financial institution, placement has occurred. To
                                conceal their activities, money launderers must either violate the reporting requirements of
                                the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act, or circumvent the traditional financial
                                system entirely (e.g., the purchase of money orders from money service bureaus).

                                     Layering describes an activity intended to obscure the trail left by the dirty money. During
                                 the layering stage, a launderer may conduct a series of transactions to build layers between the
                                 funds and their illicit source. For example, a series of wire transfers would constitute layering.
                                     During the final stage of the laundering process, illicit funds are integrated with monies
                                 from legitimate sources as they enter the mainstream economy.


                  3. 2. 4        RED FLAGS
                                      There are particular signs of suspicious activity that may suggest money laundering. If a red
                                 flag is detected, additional diligence is required. Examples of red flags include the following.
                                 ■■ A customer engages in transactions that lack business sense or apparent investment strat-
                                      egy or are inconsistent with the customer’s goals.
                                 ■■ A customer attempts to make frequent or large deposits of currency, insists on dealing only
                                      in cash equivalents, or asks for an exemption from the firm’s policies relating to the deposit
                                      of cash or cash equivalents.
                                 ■■ For no apparent reason, a customer has multiple accounts under a single name or multiple
                                      names, with a large number of interaccount or third-party transfers.
                                 ■■ A customer has a large number of wire transfers to unrelated third parties inconsistent
                                      with the customer’s business.
                                 ■■ A customer exhibits a lack of concern regarding risks, commissions, or other transaction
                                      costs.


                  3. 2. 5        SECTION 314(A) REQUEST
                                      About twice a month, FinCEN will email broker-dealers, banks, and other financial insti-
                                 tutions notifying a User Supervisor of FinCEN’s Secure Information Sharing System at the
                                 broker-dealer that there is a list of available people and businesses subject to a high level of
                                 scrutiny by a law enforcement case agent. Those authorized by the firm are then to immedi-
                                 ately compare FinCEN’s lists with the firm’s list of customers to see if there is a match. If there
                                 is a match to a named subject, you must respond to the 314(a) request within 14 calendar days.

                  3. 3. 1        DEALINGS WITH NONMEMBERS
                                     Member firms can only grant concessions, discounts, and other allowances to fellow mem-
                                 bers. Nonmember firms, including suspended members, always buy at the public price, never at
                                 a discount. In general, nonmember firms are treated the same as the general public. However,
                                 there is an exception: foreign nonmember firms, which, for whatever reason, are ineligible for
                                 membership, may be granted concessions, discounts, or other allowances provided they agree
                                 to abide by FINRA’s Rules.

                                    Similarly, members may not pay a commission to a nonmember for executing an over-the-
                                counter trade in a nonexempt security. Commissions, however, may be paid to nonmembers
                                for executing trades in exempt securities or to nonmembers executing trades on an exchange
                                floor.
                                    Also, member firms, when organizing a group to underwrite nonexempt securities, can
                                only invite other members into the syndicate or selling group. However, when it comes to
                                exempt securities, such as municipal bonds, nonmembers such as banks can be part of the
                                underwriting group.
                                    A suspended member cannot be part of a group underwriting nonexempt securities.

                                                   empt securities, even if the member’s suspension period would end before the effec-

       3. 3. 2                  CONTINUING COMMISSIONS
                                    A registered person who leaves a member firm (e.g., upon retirement) may continue to
                                receive commissions on business placed while employed. There must, however, be a contract
                                to this effect before the representative leaves the firm. Heirs of a deceased representative may
                                receive continuing commissions if this is part of the written agreement.
                                    There is no requirement for members to pay continuing commissions. Continuing com-
                                missions may never be paid on business referred or introduced by an employee after that per-
                                son ceases to be registered with the member.



       3. 4             COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE PUBLIC
                        (FINRA RULE 2210)
                                    Communications with the public takes many forms, such as brochures, emails, weblogs,
                                speaking engagements, and written reports. Supervision of communications is no different
                                than any other aspect of operating a broker-dealer building a culture of compliance. Each
                                member must establish, maintain, and enforce WSPs to supervise communications, and since
                                each firm differs and may have procedures that are more restrictive than FINRA’s require-
                                ments, supervisors must make certain all APs know and follow the firm’s guidelines.
                                    In keeping with FINRA Rule 2210, there are three principal categories of communications:
                                ■■ Retail communications
                                ■■ Correspondence
                                ■■ Institutional communications

                                    “Retail communication” means any written (including electronic) communication that is
                                distributed or made available to more than 25 retail investors within any 30 calendar-day period.
                                A retail investor is any person other than an institutional investor, regardless of whether the
                                person has an account with the member.
                                    “Correspondence” means any written (including electronic) communication that is dis-
                                tributed or made available to 25 or fewer retail investors within any 30 calendar-day period.

                                            “Institutional communication” means any written (including electronic) communication
                                        that is distributed or made available only to institutional investors, but does not include a
                                        member’s internal communications (e.g., internal memos).
                                            Examples of institutional investors include the following:
                                        ■■ Another member firm or registered representative
                                        ■■ Bank
                                        ■■ Savings and loan (S&L)
                                        ■■ Insurance company
                                        ■■ Registered investment company (mutual fund)
                                        ■■ Employee benefit plan with at least 100 participants
                                        ■■ Governmental entity or subdivision
                                        ■■ Person acting solely on behalf of an institutional investor
                                        ■■ Any entity with $50 million or more of total assets

                                            FINRA mandates that no member may treat a communication as having been distributed
                                        to an institutional investor if the member firm has reason to believe that the communication
                                        or any part of it will be forwarded or made available to any retail investor.

                                                             If an entity does not fall under any of the designated categories for an institu-
                                                         tional investor, they must be considered and treated as a retail investor. That is true
                                                         whether or not the person has an account with the member firm.




                  3. 4. 1               WRITTEN PROCEDURES, EDUCATION, AND TRAINING
                                            Prior principal review is not required for correspondence. Member firms that do not review
                                        correspondence in advance must have written procedures in place providing for the educa-
                                        tion and training of their representatives as to FINRA rules on public communications and
                                        document this training in writing. Firms must have procedures in place for a postdistribution
                                        review of at least some of each representative’s correspondence to ensure adherence to FINRA
                                        rules. Principals must be prepared to evidence to FINRA and SEC examiners during their
                                        routine review of a member firm that there are procedures in place and those procedures are
                                        being followed. A firm’s inability to provide such evidence could lead to sanctions for failing
                                        to supervise.
                                            With regard to incoming correspondence, firms can elect to do a predistribution review or
                                        a postdistribution review. If a firm elects the latter, it must take steps to ensure that proper pro-
                                        cedures are followed if any incoming mail contains either a customer complaint or customer
                                        funds or securities.
                                            When developing firm procedures, it would be wise to keep in mind that all communica-
                                        tion must be based on principles of fair dealing and good faith. That means an omission of any
                                        material fact within the context of a presentation that could be judged misleading. An omis-
                                        sion could be deemed to occur even if the information is in the presentation but placed (“hid-
                                        den”) in a footnote, which could hinder investors’ understanding depending on the nature of
                                        the audience. Members and their APs must know their audience and provide communication
                                        that is appropriate. A large, public audience of elderly investors would be handled quite differ-
                                        ently from a closed audience of known registered investment advisers.

                                    Communications with the public may not predict performance or imply that an excellent
                                past performance will likely be repeated. In other words, no exaggerated claims or forecasts.
                                That said, the rules do not preclude the use of legitimate, known, and accepted mathematical
                                principals and analysis tools.
                                    A few additional content standards for retail communications and correspondence include
                                prominently using the name of the firm and clearly indicating that the services and products
                                discussed are offered through the member firm.
                                    If a reference is used, such as tax-free, the communication must point to which income
                                taxes apply (state, local, federal) unless free from all taxes. It is a violation to say tax-free with
                                regard to an investment if it is in fact only tax deferred.
                                    When communication involves the performance of mutual funds and/or ETFs, the maxi-
                                mum expense ratio must be included.
                                    Overall, any recommendations made to investors must be reasonable and must disclose
                                conflicts of interest. If the firm is a market maker in the recommended security or managed
                                a public offering of the recommended issuer in the last 12 months, that must be disclosed. If
                                the representative making the recommendation has an interest in the issuer, that too must be
                                disclosed.

                                                   procedures in place to perform a postdistribution review. A file of all correspondence
                                                   must be retained for three years.



       3. 4. 2                  INSTITUTIONAL COMMUNICATIONS
                                     Individual participants of employee benefit plans and qualified plans are not considered
                                institutional investors. If a member has reason to believe that a communication or excerpt of
                                the communication intended for institutional investors will be forwarded to or made avail-
                                able to a person who is not an institutional investor, the communication must be treated as
                                retail communications until the member reasonably concludes that the improper practice has
                                ceased. This distinction is important, because any account that isn’t an institutional account
                                is a retail account and requires more rigorous review.
                                     Each member firm is expected to establish written procedures that are appropriate to its
                                business, size, structure, and customers for the review of institutional communications used by
                                the member and its APs by a principal.
                                     The firm’s procedures must be reasonably designed to ensure that institutional communi-
                                cations comply with applicable standards. When firm procedures do not require review of all
                                institutional communications prior to first use or distribution, they must include provision for
                                the education and training of APs as to the firm’s procedures governing institutional commu-
                                nications, documentation of such education and training, and surveillance and follow-up to
                                ensure that such procedures are implemented and adhered to.
                                     Evidence that these supervisory procedures have been implemented and carried out must
                                be maintained and made available on request by FINRA examiners.

                  3. 4. 3       RETAIL COMMUNICATIONS
                                    As previously stated, retail communication is defined as “any written (including elec-
                                tronic) communication that is distributed or made available to more than 25 retail investors
                                within any 30-calendar-day period.” Communication that would ordinarily be thought of as
                                advertising falls under this definition.
                                    What is a retail investor? It’s any person—other than an institutional investor—regardless
                                of whether the person has an account with the firm.
                                    An appropriately qualified registered principal of the member must approve each retail
                                communication before the earlier of its use or filing with FINRA’s Advertising Regulation
                                Department.
                                    The requirement to have a principal approve retail communication does not apply if, at
                                the time that a member intends to distribute it,
                                ■■ another member has filed it with FINRA’s Advertising Regulation Department and has
                                    received a letter from the department stating that it appears to be consistent with appli-
                                    cable standards; and
                                ■■ the member using it in reliance on the letter has not materially altered it and will use it
                                    in a manner that is consistent with the conditions of FINRA’s Advertising Department’s
                                    letter.

                                    In addition, the requirement of prior principal approval generally will not apply with
                                regard to any retail communication that is posted on an online interactive electronic forum,
                                and any retail communication that does not make any financial or investment recommenda-
                                tion or otherwise promote a product or service of the member.
                                    FINRA also may grant an exception from the approval rule for good cause.

                                                     Note that the term “retail investor” refers to any customer, existing or prospec-
                                                tive, that does not fit into the definition of institutional client. With the exception of

                                the customer educational material that includes information and a discussion on the:
                                ■■ characteristics and risks of CMOs, including prepayment rates and average lives; interest
                                    rates, including their effect on value and prepayment rates; tax considerations; transaction
                                    costs; and liquidity;

                                   Any retail communication concerning CMOs:
                                ■■ may not compare CMOs to any other investment vehicle, including bank CDs;
                                ■■ must disclose, if applicable, that a government agency backing applies only to the face
                                   value of the CMO and not to any premium paid; and
                                ■■ must disclose that a CMO’s yield and average life will fluctuate depending on the prepay-

                                    With regard to retail communication relating to options and security futures, the mem-
                                ber must file copies with FINRA at least 10 days before first use (prefiling). Firms have two
                                methods of filing with FINRA’s Advertising Regulation Department: (1) electronically using a
                                web-based filing system, or (2) in hard copy. The web-based system for filing materials is called
                                Advertising Regulation Electronic Files (AREF).
                                    Options advertising is limited to:
                                ■■ a general description of the security being offered and its issuer, the Options Clearing
                                    Corporation;
                                ■■ a description of the nature and functions of the options markets; and
                                ■■ the name and address of the person at the member firm placing the advertisement from
                                    whom a current OCC Disclosure Booklet may be obtained.

                                     Recommendations, past performance, and projected performance are not permitted in
                                options advertising.
                                     For a period of one year beginning on the date reflected in the Central Registration
                                Depository (CRD®) system as the date that FINRA membership became effective, the
                                member must file with the department at least 10 business days prior to first use any retail com-
                                munication that is published or used in any electronic or other public media. Once that year
                                has elapsed, prefiling is not required except for options, security futures, and certain invest-
                                ment company material.
                                     All retail communication for investment companies that include a ranking or comparison
                                that is generally not published, or is the creation of the investment company or the member,
                                must be filed at least 10 business days before first use. If the ranking or comparison is generally
                                published or is the creation of an independent entity (e.g., Lipper, Morningstar®), the basic
                                filing rules for investment companies apply (within 10 days of first use [postfiling]).
                                     All retail communication for investment companies that contain bond fund volatility rat-
                                ing must be prefiled.
                                     Any form of public communication provided to a member by an investment company is
                                not subject to filing by the member. In this case, it is the investment company’s responsibility
                                to see that a proper filing has been made.

                                            If FINRA believes that a member’s retail communication has departed from acceptable
                                        standards, it can mandate prefiling of any communications with the public.

                  3. 4. 5               PUBLIC APPEARANCE
                                             Public appearance is participation in a seminar, webinar, forum, radio or television inter-
                                        view, or other public appearance or public speaking activity.
                                             Each member shall establish written procedures that are appropriate to its business, size,
                                        structure, and customers to supervise its associated persons’ public appearances. Such pro-
                                        cedures must provide for the education and training of associated persons who make public
                                        appearances as to the firm’s procedures, documentation of such education and training, and
                                        surveillance and follow-up to ensure that such procedures are implemented and adhered to.
                                        Evidence that these supervisory procedures have been implemented and carried out must be
                                        maintained and made available to FINRA upon request.
                                             Any scripts, slides, handouts, or other written (including electronic) materials used in
                                        connection with public appearances are considered communications for purposes of this rule,
                                        and members must comply with all applicable provisions of this rule based on those communi-
                                        cations’ audience, content, and use.
                                             If an associated person recommends a security in a public appearance, the associated per-
                                        son must have a reasonable basis for the recommendation. The associated person also must
                                        disclose any conflicts of interest that may exist, such as having a financial interest in any secu-
                                        rity being recommended.


                  3. 4. 6               INDEPENDENTLY PREPARED REPORTS
                                            An independently prepared reprint is any article reprint prepared by an independent
                                        publisher and not materially altered by the member firm (other than to correct factual errors).
                                        An independent publisher is one who is not an affiliate of the member firm or is not an
                                        underwriter of any security mentioned in the reprint. Independently prepared reprints require
                                        preuse approval by a principal to ensure accuracy of the reprint but are not subject to any filing
                                        requirements with FINRA.

                                                            An article may be used as an independent reprint if the publisher is not affiliated
                                                        with the issuer or the member firm in any way. The member firm may alter the con-
                                                        tents of an independently prepared reprint only to correct factual errors or to make
                                                        the article consistent with regulatory standards.



                  3. 4. 7               INSTANT MESSAGING (IM)
                                             Instant messaging is an electronic form of communication with the public that can fit into
                                        either of two categories, depending on how it is used. If falling within the numerical limits
                                        previously described, it can be considered correspondence. If not, it will be retail communica-
                                        tion. The difference is that correspondence does not require prior principal approval, while
                                        retail communication does. FINRA requires that if firms permit IM, they must use a platform
                                        that enables members to monitor, archive, and retrieve message traffic. Copies of message traf-
                                        fic must be kept for three years.

                                                   than that used in the member’s name.



       3. 4. 8                  SPECIFIC STANDARDS
                                     In addition to general standards that require good taste and truthfulness, FINRA has spe-
                                cific standards applicable to communications with the public. It is unprofessional to claim
                                opinions, projections, and forecasts as guarantees of performance.
                                     Testimonials must not be misleading or suggest that past performance (or the personal
                                experience of the person providing the testimonial) is an indication of future performance. If
                                the member firm paid a fee to the person for the testimonial or endorsement that had a value
                                in excess of $100, it must be disclosed that it is a paid testimonial. If the testimonial implies
                                that the person is making the statement based on special experience or knowledge, the adver-
                                tisement must state the person’s qualifications.
                                     Any statement in a public communication to the effect that any service will be furnished
                                free of charge cannot be made unless such service will be provided without condition or
                                obligation.
                                     Public communication may not make any reference to membership in FINRA or any
                                other SRO that would imply endorsement or approval.
                                     Advertisements in connection with the recruitment of sales personnel must not contain
                                exaggerated or unwarranted claims about opportunities in the securities business and should
                                not refer to specific earnings figures or ranges that are not reasonable.

                                                       Blind recruitment advertisements (those that direct the reader to forward a
                                                   resume to an undisclosed employer) are the only form of communication with the
                                                   public that do not require the member’s name.

                                    Communications should not discuss periodic plans, such as dollar cost averaging, without
                                disclosing that these plans do not ensure a profit and do not protect against loss in a declin-
                                ing market. Further, the communication should point out that investors should consider their
                                ability to continue purchases through adverse financial conditions.

                  3. 4. 9        SOCIAL NETWORKING
                                     FINRA’s Social Networking Task Force was organized to discuss how member firms and
                                 registered representatives could make use of social media websites for business while ensur-
                                 ing customer protection from false or misleading claims, as well as ensuring that compliance
                                 departments of member firms are able to effectively supervise associated persons’ involvement
                                 in these sites.
                                     Firms are required to retain records of communications related to the member’s business
                                 that are made through social media sites. Firms that intend to communicate directly or permit
                                 representatives to communicate through social media sites must make certain they are able to
                                 capture that communication and retain records of those communications. (See Rules 17a-3
                                 and 17a-4 and FINRA Rule 4510 for more information.)
                                     Firms must determine which system or program is best for them in providing the retention
                                 and retrieval functions necessary to comply with the books and records rules.


                        3. 4. 9. 1   Suitability Issues and Communications
                                     If a member firm or one of its associates recommends a security through a social media site,
                                 such as Facebook, LinkedIn, or MySpace, it triggers FINRA Rule 2111 regarding suitability.
                                     Whether a particular post on a website is a recommendation for a security will depend on
                                 the facts and circumstances. The Series 24 examination asks questions about specific dates,
                                 percentages, haircuts, and so on; but there is more to it than that. As a principal level exam, it
                                 tests a candidate’s ability to parse questions carefully and to make difficult judgment calls based
                                 on limited facts and circumstances.
                                     As an example, a web-based communication that would fall outside the definition of a rec-
                                 ommendation would be if a member firm created a website available to customers that have an
                                 electronic library containing research reports, which may include buy/sell recommendations
                                 as well as news, quotes, and charts that customers may request. The facts indicate this is not a
                                 recommendation, and suitability rules are not triggered.
                                     An example of communication that falls within the definition of recommendation under
                                 the rule would be when a member sends a targeted email or pop-up screen to a customer or
                                 targeted group of customers encouraging them to buy a security.

                                     Another example of a recommendation would include a member that sends its customers
                                an email stating they should be invested in stocks from a particular industry sector and urges
                                customers to buy stocks from a list with “buy” recommendations.
                                     As you can see, it can be a challenge to identify when a “recommendation” is made,
                                thereby triggering suitability concerns. Compliance officers must consider many factors when
                                developing procedures and best practices for the member firm’s written supervisory procedures
                                (WSPs) in supervising the use of social interactive electronic communications on a social
                                media site that recommend specific investment products.
                                     As a best practice, compliance officers might consider prohibiting all interactive electronic
                                communications that recommend a specific investment product and any link to a recommen-
                                dation unless a thoroughly trained and qualified registered principal has granted prior approval
                                of the content. In addition, some member firms maintain libraries of previously approved com-
                                munications to which their representatives have regular access. Compliance officers might
                                consider prohibiting communications that recommend specific investments unless the com-
                                munication matches a pre-approved template and the recommendation has been approved by
                                a registered principal.
                                     In recent years, yields on T-bills, for example, have been at historic lows. This has prompted
                                some investors, including senior citizens, to take risk that they either cannot identify or are
                                inadequately disclosed in hopes of achieving greater returns. This is known as yield chasing.
                                In this environment, retail investors are susceptible to recommendations to chase yields with-
                                out applying the risk-reward model. Supervisors must enforce robust-heightened supervisory
                                systems to ensure no one at the firm would offer securities or services that:
                                ■■ reps have not been adequately trained or cannot explain;
                                ■■ customers don’t understand;
                                ■■ pose risk beyond what is reasonable for that particular individual investor in hopes of get-
                                     ting greater returns (yield chasing);
                                ■■ lack liquidity required by a customer;
                                ■■ have cash flow outside the investor’s time horizons;
                                ■■ lack transparency to make an informed decision; and
                                ■■ imply a special expertise where none exists.

                 CASE STUDY                             Mr. Gavrilo Princip, representing Boonville Securities, attempted to convince
                                                   senior citizens he was a bona fide senior financial advisor with his designation of
                                                   “Chartered Senior Advisor.” His sales material stated, “Gavrilo is one of only 4,000
                                                   Chartered Senior Advisors (ChSA) in the U.S. and is therefore well-trained and
                                                   qualified to render advice on senior finances.” This claim was unsubstantiated. One
                                                   of several complainants (a woman in her 80s) indicated that the ChSA designation
                                                   influenced her decision to purchase his offered annuity products. In the complaint,
                                                   she claimed that when she began to express dissatisfaction with a particular product,
                                                   “Mr. Princip pointed to his credentials in senior financial services or something to that
                                                   affect” and told her that, “The product is a great investment for people over 65.”
                                                   Mr. Princip earned more than $650,000 selling annuities during the year he used the
                                                   unsupported ChSA designation.

                                                             The use of a specious title with the view to burnish a resume is inconsistent
                                                        with just and equitable principals of trade. Mr. Princip was sanctioned. He was fined
                                                        $50,000 and barred from associating in any capacity with any FINRA-regulated firm
                                                        for making misrepresentations, omitting material facts, and using misleading state-
                                                        ments to customers. Boonville Securities was ordered to pay restitution and fined
                                                        $100,000 for failing to properly supervise Mr. Gavrilo’s activities in view of significant
                                                        red flags and for failing to properly maintain advertising records. This decision has
                                                        been appealed.

                                             As mentioned in Unit 2, suitability is more than just making appropriate recommenda-
                                        tions based on a customer’s profile. A representative has an additional obligation to reasonably
                                        explain the characteristics and risks associated with the securities being recommended.
                                             Failure to obtain sufficient knowledge of the characteristics and risks of securities and rec-
                                        ommend them anyway is deemed making an unsuitable trade and subjects the representative
                                        and the supervising principal to sanctions.
                                             A registered representative recently admitted in an on the record (OTR) interview with
                                        FINRA examiners that he had not read the offering memorandum of a privately placed series
                                        of notes that had a history of missing coupon payments. He also admitted he had not par-
                                        ticipated in due diligence meetings where the full risks of the offering were disclosed and
                                        discussed. Nevertheless, not knowing much about the notes, he placed them in a customer’s
                                        account. He told examiners that had he known about the risks, he would never have placed
                                        them with customers who had declared their risk tolerance to be medium. He was fined and
                                        suspended.
                                             Alternative funds are a potential source of suitability problems. As the name implies,
                                        alternative mutual funds employ non-traditional trading strategies and investments. These
                                        alternative (alt) funds tend to be complex, and even though they are registered under the
                                        Investment Company Act of 1940, unlike hedge funds, investors can expect greater risk expo-
                                        sure. Principals must be confident that the representatives selling or attempting to sell alt
                                        funds be thoroughly knowledgeable about the characteristics of the fund but that they are
                                        careful as to how and whom they approach.

                                                              A registered representative must know his customer and make appropriate rec-
                                                        ommendations based on the customer’s profile. In addition, he must be knowledge-
                                                        able about the securities being offered. It is not possible for a representative to make
                                                        a reasonable and suitable recommendation if he knows nothing about the character-
                                                        istics of the securities he is offering. The greater the complexity of the security, the
                                                        greater the need for enhanced understanding by those offering it, and delineation
                                                        and clarification of the risks associated with it when selling or attempting to sell to

                                                             Alternative funds (also known as “alt” mutual funds) are SEC-registered funds
                                                        that may hold more non-traditional investments and employ more complex strate-

                                                   may carry additional risks from strategies as well, such as targeting specific returns
                                                   or benchmarks. Supervisors are expected to exert the appropriate effort to regulate
                                                   the sale of such complex investments and have a reasonable supervisory system
                                                   in place to determine whether the purchases of alternative investments would cause
                                                   a customer’s account to be unsuitably concentrated in those investments. Lastly,
                                                   supervisors must adequately train the staff to analyze suitability standards as part of

                                                   Alt funds are regulated, which limits their operations in ways that do not apply to
                                                   unregistered hedge funds.


             3. 4. 9. 2             Interactive Electronic Forums
                                     FINRA’s definition of public appearance is an unscripted participation in an interactive
                                electronic forum, such as an online seminar. FINRA does not require prior principal approval
                                for extemporaneous remarks made by representatives who make public appearances. However,
                                these interactive electronic forums are subject to other supervisory requirements and to the
                                content requirements of FINRA’s communications rule, such as recordkeeping and making
                                a reasonable effort to state facts accurately and outside any possible quiet period (See quiet
                                period in Unit 5).
                                     The Merriam-Webster’s Online Dictionary defines blog as “a website that contains an
                                online personal journal with reflections, comments, and often hyperlinks provided by the
                                writer.”
                                     Some parts of an interactive electronic forum, such as seen on a profile page of a blog, are
                                static; that is, content is accessible to all visitors and remains up until removed or revised.
                                FINRA considers static blogs as an advertisement. If a firm or its associated persons (APs)
                                sponsor a static blog, they must obtain prior principal approval. Merely updating the blog, even
                                frequently, does not change that.
                                     Blogs that engage in real-time interactive communication with third parties are deemed
                                to be interactive electronic forums by FINRA. In that case, no prior principal approval is
                                required, but it must be supervised.
                                     Social networking sites, such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn, include static content
                                and interactive content. Generally speaking, static content is accessible to all, such as a repre-
                                sentative’s profile, background, or wall information, as opposed to a status update on Facebook,
                                which is interactive content. A principal of the firm must approve all static content on a
                                social networking site established either by the firm or a registered representative before it
                                is posted. Twitter is deemed a social networking, micro-blog service enabling users to send
                                and receive text-based posts of up to 140 characters. If posts are made by a member firm or a
                                representative on its behalf with the public’s participation, the micro-blog would be generally
                                considered retail communications and subject to principal approval, recordkeeping, and filing
                                requirements.
                                     Representatives who are permitted to tweet about investments to their followers should
                                do so only with prior approval. Tweeting overly positive messages without disclosing material
                                information about any recommendation could lead to sanctions.
                                     Social networking makes it somewhat easy to solicit and gain a recommendation or testi-
                                monial. The greatest of care should be taken with regard to testimonials. Any retail commu-
                                nication that includes a testimonial must explain that the testimonial may not represent the
                                experience of others and is not a guarantee of futures performance. If more than $100 was paid
                                for the testimonial, that too must be disclosed.

                                            Lastly, do not confuse clearly distinguishable paid advertising with paying for or in any way
                                        rewarding someone for the purpose of influencing the price of a security. For example, it would
                                        be a violation of FINRA Rule 5230 to furnish theater tickets to a news reporter for writing
                                        something favorable about a company in order to boost its stock price or to slip a radio show

                                             Supervision by the firm or its APs who use blogs or social networking sites must be done
                                        in a manner reasonably designed to ensure that they do not violate the content requirements
                                        of FINRA’s communications rules.
                                             Firms may adopt risk-based principles to supervise incoming, outgoing, and internal elec-
                                        tronic communications. For example, firms may adopt sampling and lexicon-based searches.
                                        Words and phrases, such as attorney, make check payable to cash, and you cannot lose may capture
                                        some communication that would need additional supervisory scrutiny and possible discipline.
                                             Firms must be stricter in their review of employees’ incoming, outgoing, and internal elec-
                                        tronic communications between non-research and research departments concerning the con-
                                        tent of a research report. NASD Rule 2711 requires a firm’s legal and compliance department
                                        be copied on all such communication.
                                             A member firm must ensure that those associated persons who participate in social media
                                        sites for business purposes are supervised and monitored and that the firm is prepared to dis-
                                        cipline anyone found in violation of company policies and FINRA rules. Furthermore, only
                                        those that are thoroughly trained in use of this type of media and do not present unneces-
                                        sary risks to customers and potential customers may participate. Associated persons who have
                                        presented compliance risks in the past with regards to sales practices, in particular, should be
                                        prohibited from establishing social media sites for business purposes.
                                             FINRA does not treat posts by customers or other third parties as the firm’s communica-

                                           If a registered representative wishes to engage in cold calling prospects, the representative
                                        must adhere to the following provisions of the FINRA Rule 3230:
                                        ■■ Cold calls can only be made between the hours of 8:00 am and 9:00 pm at the called-
                                           person’s location (prospect’s local time)
                                        ■■ The caller must disclose his name and the name of the member firm, the telephone num-
                                           ber or address at which the caller may be contacted, and that the purpose of the call is to

                                ■■ If the called person wishes to not be re-contacted, that person’s name and phone number
                                   must be placed on a Do-Not-Call list and maintained for an indefinite period
                                ■■ Callers must transmit caller identification information (caller ID blocking is prohibited)
                                ■■ Callers must not use deceptive or abusive telemarketing acts or practices

                                    The act deals with solicitations made using telephone lines, which includes electronic
                                mail and fax transmissions. It does not deal with solicitations made using the U.S. mail.
                                    In addition to a firm-specific Do-Not-Call list, there is a National Do-Not-Call list main-
                                tained by the FTC indefinitely. Members may not make telephone solicitations to persons on
                                this list with three exceptions.
                                ■■ The member has an established business relationship with the recipient of the call.
                                ■■ The member has obtained the person’s prior written consent.
                                ■■ The person making the call has a personal relationship with the recipient of the call.

                                   An established business relationship exists if:
                                ■■ the person to be contacted has made a financial transaction or has a security position, a
                                   money balance, or account activity with the member within the 18 months immediately
                                   preceding the date of the call;
                                ■■ the member is(was) the broker-dealer of record for the person within the 18 months imme-
                                   diately preceding the date of the call; or
                                ■■ the person has contacted the member to inquire about a product or service within the
                                   three months immediately preceding the date of the call.

                                                   is a safe harbor provision in the law. As long as an inadvertent call is made no more
                                                   than 31 days from the date a firm obtained the latest version of the list, there is no
                                                   violation.

                                                   this person on June 20, there is no violation, because the list used by the member is
                                                   no more than 31 days old.

                  4. 1. 1        MARKET CENTERS
                                      When a member firm’s customer calls a broker to place an order to buy or sell, the firm
                                 forwards the order to a market center to be executed. The following are market centers that
                                 are available for trade execution.
                                      An exchange is a market center where traders can buy or sell securities. For a stock that’s
                                 listed on an exchange (e.g., NYSE or Nasdaq), the firm may direct the order to that exchange
                                 or to a competing exchange. Alternatively, the order may be forwarded to a member firm reg-
                                 istered as a market maker in that stock.
                                      A market maker is a member firm that publishes quotes in a stock and stands ready to buy
                                 or sell a given number of shares on a continuous basis. Market makers are generally required
                                 to publish firm quotes and may not back away from them. In addition, market makers are
                                 expected to maintain quotes that are priced somewhere near the national best bid and offer.
                                 In other words, they are precluded from entering “stub quotes” that are priced so far away from
                                 the market that it’s clear that they were never intended to be executed.
                                      Some market makers, in an attempt to increase order flow, will pay other member firms
                                 for routing customer orders to them. This is known simply as payment for order flow and is an
                                 acceptable practice.
                                      For a stock that trades in an over-the-counter (OTC) market, such as the OTC Bulletin
                                 Board, the firm would send the order to an OTCBB market maker.
                                      Market makers are not permitted to accept any kind of payment from an issuer to act as
                                 a market maker in its stock. This, however, does not preclude a market maker from receiving
                                 payment for its investment banking services, including being reimbursed for expenses associ-
                                 ated with registering the stock with the SEC or the states.
                                      An order may be directed to a separate division of the member firm to be filled from inven-
                                 tory from the firm’s propriety account rather than sending it to a market or market makers.
                                 This internalization permits the brokerage firm to make money on the spread in similar fash-
                                 ion to a market maker.
                                      Orders also may be routed to an electronic communications network (ECN). An ECN is
                                 an electronic trading system that automatically matches buy and sell orders at specified prices.
                                 ECNs are SEC-sanctioned alternative trading systems (ATS) that are open 24 hours a day and
                                 match buy and sell orders as agents, not as principals. Extended hours orders are handled by
                                 ECNs.
                                      Throughout the history of trading securities in the United States, the NYSE set the stan-
                                 dards. Normal trading times from 9:30 am until 4:00 pm ET Monday through Friday was the
                                 norm. However, in the latter part of the twentieth century, the demand for after-hours trad-
                                 ing grew. Now, after the closing bell, ECNs make it easy for both institutional and individual
                                 investors to access the after-hours market. However, care must be taken, because after-hours
                                 volume is low, often leading to higher volatility, wider spreads, and larger price fluctuations
                                 than investors would expect to see during the day session. Supervisors should be mindful that
                                 customers trading after-hours face these additional trading risks. Institutional customers may
                                 be fully able to manage these risks, but extra care should be taken to supervise retail customer
                                 accounts.
                                      There are a variety of market makers. For example, A “Qualified OTC Market Maker”
                                 must maintain a minimum net capital, of the lesser of $250,000 or $25,000 plus $5,000 for
                                 each security in excess of five in which it makes a market. An OTC Margin Security is any
                                 securities listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

                                    The term “Qualified Third Market Maker” is a dealer in any stock registered on a national

                                                      As of August 1, 2006, the Nasdaq stock market began to operate as an indepen-
                                                 dent national securities exchange. As a result, the distinction between “listed” and
                                                 “unlisted” securities has become blurred. Furthermore, with its acquisition of NYSE
                                                 Arca Equities, the NYSE competes directly with Nasdaq in that Arca operates as a fully
                                                 electronic stock exchange. A NYSE member firm that also is a member of the NYSE
                                                 Arca must have supervisory procedures that incorporated rules of both exchanges.



       4. 1. 2                  AGENCY VERSUS PRINCIPAL
                                    All customer trades executed on an exchange floor are done on an agency basis—the firm
                                executing the trade on behalf of the customer acts as a broker, charging the customer a com-
                                mission. Acting as a broker means finding a buyer for a seller and vice versa.
                                    In the over-the-counter market, however, a member firm may act as either a broker
                                (agency) or a dealer (principal). When acting as a dealer, the member is on the other side
                                of a trade with a customer—when a customer buys, it is the member who is selling to that
                                customer from its inventory; and when a customer sells, it is the member who is buying from
                                that customer for its inventory. To act as a dealer, the member must maintain an inventory of
                                that particular security.
                                    In addition, when acting as a dealer, a member will mark up when a customer buys and
                                mark down when a customer sells. When a price to a customer includes a markup or mark-
                                down, it is termed a net price. A firm may never charge a commission in addition to a markup
                                or markdown. This is called a hidden profit and is a rules violation.

                  4. 2. 1        NYSE LISTING REQUIREMENTS
                                     The New York Stock Exchange is one of 11 registered exchanges operated by the
                                 Intercontinental Exchange. The NYSE Group is comprised of the NYSE, NYSE MKT, NYSE
                                 Arca, NYSE Amex Options, NYSE Arca Options, and NYSE Bonds. The NYSE maintains a
                                 physical floor-based business model to offer equities through IPOs and trading in a liquid sec-
                                 ondary market. Not all companies are eligible or choose to list their securities for trading on
                                 the NYSE; but if they do, they must satisfy the exchange’s exacting standards. The Series 24
                                 exam only requires a general knowledge of the minimum criteria. Other than the minimum $4
                                 share price at the time of listing, numerical values are not tested.
                                     A company applying for listed trading on the NYSE must be registered with the SEC; in
                                 other words, it needs to be a publicly owned company. It must offer a minimum number of
                                 shares and have a minimum number of round-lot shareholders. However, aside from objective
                                 values, the company must enjoy a good degree of national interest as a mature, front-rank com-
                                 pany in its industry. The exchange has broad discretion in its listing process that go beyond
                                 minimum numerical, objective standards. Apart from the few standards thus mentioned, the
                                 Exchange offers several alternative admixtures of capitalization, earnings, cash flow, et cetera,
                                 but none involve a minimum earnings per share.

                                   These listing requirements are very similar to those established for Nasdaq Global Select
                                and Capital Market securities.



           TEST TOPIC ALERT
                            !                         Though the numerical values are not tested, note that there is no minimum earn-
                                                 ings per share (EPS) requirement to qualify for NYSE listing.


             4. 2. 1. 1             Delisting
                                    The NYSE reserves the right to delist issuers for a number of reasons, including failure to
                                meet minimum maintenance criteria (e.g., number of shareholders owning 100 shares or more,
                                number of publicly held shares). Bankruptcy, abnormally low share price or share volume, and
                                corporate actions not deemed to be in the public interest could result in delisting.
                                    If an issuer wants to voluntarily delist from the NYSE, all that is required is for the board
                                of directors to approve. The issuer must furnish the NYSE with a certified board resolution
                                evidencing board approval.

                                                      A voluntary delisting also requires that the issuer file Form 25 with the NYSE and
                                                 simultaneously with the SEC. The Form certifies that the issuer has complied with the
                                                 rules of the Exchange, as well as those of the Commission regarding a voluntary delist-
                                                 ing.



       4. 2. 2                  TRADING FLOOR PARTICIPANTS
                                     The NYSE trading model includes several important market participants. They are the
                                designated market maker (DMM), special liquidity providers (SLPs), and floor brokers, as well
                                as firms that trade NASDAQ UTP (unlisted trading privileges).
                                     The chief underlying principal of all securities law is to protect customers. With that in
                                mind, know that trading floor participants are restricted from impacting any trade for their
                                own accounts or the accounts of an associated person, or an account over which it has discre-
                                tion that would impair the protection of investors and the maintenance of a fair and orderly
                                market. At a minimum, trading floor participants must yield priority, parity, and precedence
                                (see the following) in trade execution to those who are not members or associated persons. In
                                other words, customers come first. However, floor participants may act, for example, as market
                                makers or effect bona fide hedge transactions.

                        4. 2. 2. 1      Designated Market Makers (DMMs)
                                         The DMM on the NYSE Floor brings order and liquidity to an exchange floor. Each listed
                                    stock is assigned by the NYSE or NYSE MKT to a particular DMM who is responsible for
                                    maintaining a liquid and continuous two-sided auction market. In a word, DMMs are the only
                                    people who are held accountable for maintaining a fair and orderly market.
                                         The DMM trades, in part, with proprietary algorithms and commits to providing pools
                                    of liquidity for the market in an assigned stock providing price improvement and match-
                                    ing incoming orders based on a Capital Commitment Schedule. The DMM unit receives
                                    only public information about orders—no first looks—so they may compete against all other
                                    market participants. DMMs have the obligation to maintain an orderly market in the stocks
                                    they’ve been assigned, quote at the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO) a specified percent-
                                    age of the time, and facilitate price discovery at the open, close, and in periods of significant
                                    imbalances.

                                                    traffic moving without incident.



                                    4. 2. 2. 1. 1 Supplemental Liquidity Providers
                                        A class of off-floor, electronic market maker that is permitted to compete with the DMM
                                    is known as a supplemental liquidity provider (SLP). SLPs are required to maintain in round
                                    lots a bid or an offer at the National Best Bid (NBB) or the National Best Offer (NBO) at
                                    least 10% of trading day for any security they are assigned. Note the requirement is for a bid
                                    or an offer (one-sided market) unlike the requirement for the DMM. In return for this service,
                                    they are rewarded with a rebate (liquidity fees) from the NYSE when their quote results in a
                                    transaction. Adding liquidity to the market is rewarded with rebates, because it generates more
                                    quoting activity, which leads to tighter spreads.

                                    4. 2. 2. 1. 2 Retail Liquidity Program
                                        The NYSE and NYSE MKT Retail Liquidity Program promotes price improvement for
                                    individual investors on retail order flow and competes with dark pools by providing transpar-
                                    ency and cost savings for individual investors through price improvement on retail order flow
                                    for NYSE and NYSE MKT-listed and NASDAQ UTP-traded equity securities.
                                        The following are two new classes of market participants on the NYSE and NYSE MKT.
                                    ■■ Retail liquidity providers (RLPs), which are required to provide potential price improve-
                                        ment for retail orders in the form of nondisplayed interest that is better than the best
                                        protected bid or the best protected offer (PBBO). Similar to other dedicated liquidity
                                        provider programs, RLPs would receive certain economic benefits in exchange for meeting
                                        performance obligations.
                                    ■■ Retail member organizations (RMOs), which would be eligible to submit certain retail
                                        order flow (retail orders) to the exchange. Retail orders are generally defined as unmodi-
                                        fied agency orders that originate from a natural person.

                                       Member organizations other than RLPs also would be permitted to submit retail price
                                    improvement. In short, the RLP program permits exchanges to advantage the “little guy.”

                                4. 2. 2. 1. 3 Non-displayed Liquidity/Dark Pools
                                    A dark pool sounds ominous, but it is simply trading volume that is offered away from, for
                                example, a trading platform such as a stock exchange. For example the NYSE Arca offers both
                                displayed and non-displayed liquidity. A dark pool may refer to an alternative trading system
                                (ATS) not available to the public but rather large institutions. Both buy-side and sell-side
                                traders look to trade particularly large orders anonymously and with low impact to market
                                prices. Dark pools are dark, because buyers and sellers expect confidentiality of their trading
                                information. There are many dark pools operated both by exchange companies, such as BATS,
                                as well as broker-dealers, such as UBS ATS and Barclays LX.

                                                         the time.

                                                      ■■ Not held orders cannot be accepted by the DMM.

                                                      ■■ The DMM firm is responsible for setting the opening quote in stocks it
                                                         represents.

                                4. 2. 2. 1. 4 Trading Posts
                                    On the NYSE floor, there are a number of trading posts surrounded by video display ter-
                                minals and related telecommunications equipment. DMMs are positioned at these posts, and
                                each has been assigned the exchange responsibility for certain issues of listed companies.
                                DMMs combine both a physical auction market and an automated auction that makes use of
                                algorithms to post quotes from the DMM as well as other market participants. Their quotes are
                                on parity with quotes from other market participants.
                                    Gathered around the post is a trading crowd, which can be as small as one floor broker
                                or many more on those days following unexpected news. In addition to order flow from floor
                                broker hand-held devices, orders are entered into the market through the Universal Trading
                                Platform.


             4. 2. 2. 2             Floor Brokers
                                    Floor brokers are generally employees of the member firms that have a trading license.
                                Their primary function is to handle the order flow received from buy-side customers from the
                                upstairs trading rooms of their employers and other member firms.


             4. 2. 2. 3             Quotes
                                    The current, two-sided quote is the best bid (highest price someone is willing to pay to
                                buy) and the best offer (lowest price that someone is willing to accept to sell). Market orders
                                are generally filled at the current quote. The current quote also will include size indicating
                                how many shares are there to buy at the best bid and to sell at the best offer. DMMs have an
                                obligation to quote at the NBBO a specified percentage of the time.

                                                    orders to sell generally will be filled at 26.12.



                  4. 2. 3           ORDER TYPES

                        4. 2. 3. 1      Market Orders
                                        A market order is an order to buy or sell at the prevailing market price. A not held mar-
                                    ket order cannot be accepted by the DMM. These orders can, however, be accepted by floor
                                    brokers and two-dollar brokers.
                                        A not held market order is a market order in which the floor trader has the discretion to
                                    execute the order when the trader feels it is best. The trader has some discretion with regard
                                    to the price and/or timing of the order.
                                        Market orders can be at the open or the close. These orders are filled at the opening price
                                    and closing price, respectively.
                                        Unless there is an order imbalance of 50,000 shares or more, market on close orders can-
                                    not be entered after 3:45 pm on the NYSE. For example, assume that at 3:45 pm the market
                                    for XYZ is 31.05–31.07, with 10,000 shares at the bid and 70,000 shares at the offer. There is
                                    an order imbalance of 60,000 shares on the sell side. Therefore, in this case, a market on close
                                    (MOC) order to buy XYZ can be entered after 3:45 pm (3:50 pm for Nasdaq).


                        4. 2. 3. 2      Limit Orders
                                        A limit order is an order to buy or sell at a specific price or better.


                        4. 2. 3. 3      Stop Orders
                                         A stop order is a resting order to buy or sell that is activated when the stock trades at or
                                    through the stop price. Once triggered automatically, the order becomes a market order. The
                                    DMM unit may then offer price improvement on the resulting market order.
                                         A stop order, also known as a stop loss order, is designed to protect a profit or prevent a
                                    loss if the stock begins to move in the wrong direction.
                                         No guarantee exists that the executed price will be the stop price, unlike the price on a
                                    limit order. Buy stop orders are entered above the current market, whereas sell stop orders are
                                    entered below the current market.
                                         A trade at the stop price triggers the order, which then becomes a market order. A stop
                                    order takes two trades to execute, which are:

                                    ■■ trigger—the trigger transaction at or through the stop price activates the trade; and then
                                    ■■ execution—the stop order becomes a market order and is executed at the next price,
                                       completing the trade.

                                   DMMs or their trading assistants are prohibited from uncovering information about
                                unelected stop orders when arranging the open or for any purpose.

                                4. 2. 3. 3. 1 Buy Stop Order
                                    A buy stop order protects a profit or limits a loss in a short stock position. The buy stop is
                                entered at a price above the current market and is triggered when the market price touches or
                                goes through the buy stop price.




                     *
                    EXAMPLE                           A customer has shorted 1,000 shares of XYZ stock at $55, and the stock is now
                                                 at $48. The customer would like to wait for more gain but is concerned the stock will
                                                 reverse itself and begin to rise, eroding some of the unrealized profit. To address this,
                                                 the customer could place the following order: buy 1,000 XYZ 49 stop. If the stock
                                                 does start to move up, once it trades at or through the stop price of 49, the order
                                                 becomes a market order to buy 1,000 XYZ.

                                     Technical traders who track support and resistance levels for stocks also use buy stop
                                orders. For instance, MNO stock trades between 38 and 42. It never seems to go above 42 or
                                below 38. Technicians believe that if the stock breaks through resistance, it will continue to
                                move upward at a rapid pace. Therefore, they will not buy at 40, because there is little upside
                                potential. However, they may place a buy stop order above the resistance level knowing that
                                if the stock breaks resistance and begins to move up, they will buy the stock before it develops
                                upward momentum.
                                     An investor might place a stop order to buy 100 MNO at 42.25 stop when the market is
                                at 40 if he believes 42 represents a technical resistance point, above which the stock price will
                                continue to rise.

                                                                        MNO Buy Stop Order

                                                     could place the following order: sell 1,000 XYZ 40 stop. If the stock does start to
                                                     move down, once it trades at or through the stop price of 40, the order becomes a
                                                     market order to sell 1,000 XYZ.

                                        Technical traders also use sell stop. Technicians believe that if a stock breaks through sup-
                                    port, it will fall. Therefore, they will not short the stock at 40, because there is little downside
                                    potential. Historically, the stock has not traded below 38. However, they may place a sell stop
                                    order just below the support level knowing that if the stock breaks through support and begins
                                    to move down, they will short the stock before it develops downward momentum.
                                        An investor who is long stock might place a stop order to sell 100 MNO at 37.75 stop
                                    when the market is at 40 if the investor believes 38 represents a technical support point below
                                    which the stock will continue to fall.

                                                                            MNO Sell Stop Order

                                                          Sell stop entered with
                                                          trigger price of 37.75

                                                                                   Sell stop triggered and
                                                                                   becomes market order



                                        If a large number of stop orders are triggered at the same price, a flurry of trading activity
                                    takes place as they become market orders. This activity will accelerate the advance or decline
                                    of the stock price.
                                        A stop limit order is a stop order that, once triggered, becomes a limit order instead of a
                                    market order.

                                EXAMPLE                   A customer long 1,000 shares of MNO calls and places the following order: “I
                                                     want to sell my MNO stock if it falls to $30, but I don’t want less than $29.95 for
                                                     these shares.” The order is entered as, sell 1,000 MNO 30 stop 29.95. If the MNO
                                                     shares trade at or below 30, the order becomes a limit order to sell at $29.95 or bet-
                                                     ter. The risk with this type of order is that the market could leap between the stop
                                                     and limit price resulting in the customer missing an execution. Assume once the order
                                                     is entered, the stock trades thusly: 30.01, 29.97, 29.94, 29.92, and so on. The trade
                                                     at 29.97 triggers the order at which point the order becomes a limit to sell at 29.95
                                                     or better (higher). In this scenario, the customer is unable to sell. The risk with a limit
                                                     order is that the investor may miss the limit.

                                                     Buy limit and sell stop orders are reduced on the ex-date. Those orders placed
                                                 above the market—sell limits and buy stops—are not adjusted on the ex-date.
                                                       For stock dividends and stock splits, all orders are adjusted. If there is a reverse
                                                 split, all orders are canceled.
                                                      In addition, market orders can specify at the open or at the close. These orders
                                                 are filled at the opening or closing price, respectively.
                                                     Under NYSE rules, market on close (MOC) orders cannot be entered after
                                                 3:45 pm. However, if there is an order imbalance of 50,000 shares or more at 3:45,
                                                 MOC orders can be entered after 3:45 but only on the opposite side of the market
                                                 from the imbalance.




                     *
                    EXAMPLE                          If, at 3:45, the market for GE is 35.20–35.22 5,000 by 60,000, there would be an
                                                 order imbalance of 55,000 shares on the offer (sell) side. Therefore, market orders to
                                                 buy at the close could be entered after 3:45 with floor official approval.

                  4. 3. 2               LIMIT UP-LIMIT DOWN (LULD)
                                            The limit up-limit down mechanism is a pilot program established in a joint effort by the
                                        exchanges and FINRA that is intended to prevent trades in individual securities from occur-
                                        ring outside a specified price band. This price band is set at a percentage level above and below
                                        the average price of the stock over the immediately preceding five-minute trading period.
                                        Price limit band percentages will vary during the phase-in period. It is unlikely that FINRA’s
                                        qualifications department would ask questions about specific numbers that are subject to rapid
                                        change. However, know that price bands will not include the first 15 minutes or last 30 min-
                                        utes of trading, which means that the LULD is effective from 9:45 am–3:30 pm, ET.

                                     The price bands double during the opening and closing periods of the trading day. If the
                                stock’s price does not naturally move back within the price bands within 15 seconds, there
                                will be a five-minute trading pause. During a LULD halt, BDs may accept orders and publish
                                quotes.
                                     As a pilot, the limit up-limit down mechanism is being implemented in two phases. The
                                first phase applies the limit up-limit down mechanism to all stocks in the S&P 500 and Russell
                                1000 indexes. This is in force at publication. The second phase of the implementation will
                                apply the limit up-limit down mechanism to all remaining NMS securities.
                                     The SEC states that this new plan requires that all trading centers, such as NASDAQ,
                                NYSE, BATS, et cetera, establish, maintain, and enforce written policies reasonably designed
                                to prevent the display of offers below the lower price band and bids above the upper price band
                                ultimately for all NMS stocks.
                                     Note that the purpose of this is to reduce the negative impact of sudden, unanticipated
                                price movements in NMS stock with the intent to protect investors and promote fair and
                                orderly markets.

                                                      More than most, these rules are subject to change, and Series 24 candidates

       4. 3. 3                  SEC RULE 201
                                     SEC Rule 201 is referred to as a circuit breaker or alternative uptick rule. It requires trad-
                                ing centers to restrict short selling if a covered security (not OTCBB or OTC Pink) declines
                                by 10% or more from the prior close. The restriction applies to the display and execution of
                                short sales and is applicable during the remainder of the trading day through the next busi-
                                ness day. The goal is to enable long sellers to sell their shares before any short sellers once the
                                circuit breaker is triggered.
                                     The alternative uptick rule permits short selling after the trigger if the price of the security
                                is above the current national best bid.
                                     Chief features of the alternative uptick rule SEC Rule 201 include the following.
                                ■■ Short Sale-Related Circuit Breaker. The circuit breaker is triggered for a security any day
                                     in which the price declines by 10% or more from the prior day’s close.
                                ■■ Duration of Price Test Restriction. Once the circuit breaker has been triggered, the rule
                                     applies to short sale orders in that security for the remainder of the day, as well as the fol-
                                     lowing day.
                                ■■ Securities Covered by Price Test Restriction. The rule generally applies to all equity secu-
                                     rities that are listed on a national securities exchange, whether traded on an exchange or
                                     in the over-the-counter market.
                                ■■ Implementation. The rule requires trading centers like Nasdaq to establish, maintain, and
                                     enforce written policies and procedures designed to prevent the execution or display of a
                                     prohibited short sale.

                                    to allow FINRA to reconstruct markets, conduct surveillance, and enforce its rules. This audit
                                    trail must provide an accurate, time-sequenced (hour, minute, and second) record of orders
                                    and transactions, beginning with the receipt of an order and further documenting the life of
                                    the order through execution or cancellation.

                                EXAMPLE                 A customer enters a market order to buy 1,000 shares of ABC. The order, which
                                                    was executed at 38.35, is erroneously reported to the customer as having been done
                                                    at 38.20. The 38.35 price is binding on the customer.

                                        Similarly, an order that was executed, but in error reported as a nothing done, is binding
                                    on the customer. On the other hand, if a customer order was not executed but was in error
                                    reported to have been executed, the “trade” is not binding on the customer.

       4. 4             NASDAQ


       4. 4. 1                  INTRODUCTION TO THE NASDAQ STOCK MARKET
                                    The Nasdaq is a screen-based, SEC-registered stock exchange. The Nasdaq can be divided
                                into two main components: (1) the Global Market, and (2) the Capital Market. Within the
                                Global Market, there is a special tier called Global Select, whose listing standards are designed
                                to compete with those of the NYSE.
                                    Securities eligible for Nasdaq listing are equity and equity equivalent securities, such as
                                common stock, preferred stock, warrants, rights, limited partnerships, American depositary
                                receipts (ADRs), and convertible bonds.
                                    As is the case with the other trading venues, liquidity is prized. NASDAQ offers its mem-
                                bers optional routing functionality that permits them to access liquidity by using a variety of
                                routing algorithms (also known as strategies) that determine the destination of an order. One
                                such algorithm is the NASDAQ DOT strategy. This is a method of designating an order to go
                                the NYSE or NYSE MKT for participation in the opening and closing. Order routing processes
                                are available to participants from the opening of the System at 4:00 a.m. ET until the closing
                                of the System at 8:00 p.m. ET.

                                                     A small number of limited partnership interests are negotiable and trade on OTC
                                                 and exchanges. These partnerships are known as master limited partnerships (MLPs).
                                                    Investors may trade shares of beneficial interest in REITS on stock exchanges or

       4. 4. 2                  NASDAQ LISTING REQUIREMENTS
                                    To qualify for Nasdaq listing for the Global Select Market, the Global Market, and the
                                Capital Market, issuers must meet certain minimum criteria that relate to total assets, net
                                worth, number of publicly held shares, bid prices, pretax income, and so forth.
                                    Some of Nasdaq’s minimum listing requirements for a company’s equity securities to trade
                                on the Global Select Market include a bid price of $4 per share for initial inclusion and $1 per
                                share for continued listing. There must be at least three market makers for initial inclusion and
                                two market makers for continued listing.
                                    Companies already listed or quoted on another marketplace (e.g., listed on a regional
                                exchange) may qualify for a Capital Market listing under the market capitalization listing
                                standard only. To do so, the issue must meet the minimum market value and bid price require-
                                ments for 90 consecutive trading days before applying for listing.
                                    There also are nonquantitative criteria that issuers must meet to qualify for Nasdaq listing.
                                These include:
                                ■■ minimum of two independent directors;
                                ■■ establishment of an audit committee;
                                ■■ providing shareholders with quarterly and annual reports;
                                ■■ having an annual shareholders meeting;
                                ■■ soliciting proxies for all shareholder meetings; and
                                ■■ executing a listing agreement with FINRA.

                        4. 4. 2. 1   Issue Termination
                                    FINRA may terminate or suspend an issue’s inclusion in Nasdaq if:
                                 ■■ the issuer files for bankruptcy;
                                 ■■ the issuers’ independent accountants issue a disclaimer opinion on the company’s financial
                                    statements (a disclaimer opinion is one in which the accountants, for whatever reason,
                                    cannot render an opinion); or
                                 ■■ FINRA deems termination to be in the public interest.

                                     A security that has been terminated must, prior to reinclusion, comply with the require-
                                 ments of initial inclusion. If suspended, however, a security, prior to reinclusion, must meet the
                                 requirements for continued inclusion (maintenance standards).


                  4. 4. 3        REGISTRATION AS A NASDAQ MARKET MAKER
                                      To register as a Nasdaq market maker, a firm must be a member of Nasdaq and file an appli-
                                 cation with the FINRA District Office denoting compliance with the net capital and other
                                 financial and operational rules. The District Office will interview the principal officers of the
                                 firm to determine if the firm is qualified to be a Nasdaq market maker.
                                      FINRA then sends an approval form to Nasdaq’s Subscribers Services department, and
                                 they in turn will notify the firm and activate all the firm’s services. FINRA will amend the
                                 firm’s membership agreement to include the new line of business.
                                      Once registered as a market maker in any issue, additional registrations are easier. If a mar-
                                 ket maker wants to be registered in a newly authorized issue, its registration request (made via
                                 a Nasdaq terminal) is effective immediately if the request is made within five business days of
                                 the issue’s inclusion in Nasdaq. If the request is made more than five business days after inclu-
                                 sion, the registration is effective the same day. The newly registered market maker must then
                                 begin quoting the security within five business days. Once registered as a market maker in a
                                 Nasdaq issue, a member must maintain firm, two-sided, continuous quotations in that issue.
                                 Quotes must be current and accessible during the normal market hours of 9:30 am–4:00 pm ET
                                 Monday through Friday. A voluntary pre-market trading session begins at 4:00 a.m. and con-
                                 tinues until 9:30 a.m. Post-market trading begins at 4:00 p.m. and continues until 8:00 p.m.
                                      Because participation in pre- and post-market trading sessions by market makers and ECNs
                                 is strictly voluntary, there is generally less liquidity, inferior prices, and higher volatility. It
                                 would be appropriate for supervisors to insist that their APs caution investors who anticipate
                                 trading during these times about the risks and that they should strongly urge their customers
                                 to use limit orders.
                                      Nasdaq also requires market makers to continuously maintain a two-sided quotation
                                 within a designated percentage of the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO). This eliminates
                                 trade executions against market maker placeholder quotations traditionally priced far away
                                 from the inside market, known as “stub quotes.” This rule covers all NMS stocks.
                                      In short, no stub quotes are allowed. Market regulators hope that, by prohibiting stub
                                 quotes, the risk of trades being executed at irrational prices will be reduced. This has the added
                                 benefit of fewer trade breaks if the market becomes volatile.


                        4. 4. 3. 1   Primary Market Maker
                                     For a Global Market stock, a market maker may be deemed to be a primary market maker
                                 in that stock if the firm meets certain criteria (not tested).

                                    The advantage of being a primary market maker in a Global Market stock is that it allows
                                the market maker an exemption from the locate requirement of Regulation SHO (discussed
                                later) in certain transactions. If a market maker is a primary market maker in a particular
                                stock, a P indicator is displayed next to its identification symbol.


             4. 4. 3. 2             Withdrawal as a Nasdaq Market Maker
                                     In certain situations, a market maker may apply to FINRA for an excused withdrawal if,
                                for a short period, the market maker wishes to withdraw its quotes from Nasdaq. Before with-
                                drawing its quote, the market maker must receive permission to do so from FINRA.
                                     Certain stocks are fungible in that their trading characteristics are predictable. In these
                                cases, any experienced market maker can trade them. Other securities have unique trading
                                characteristics, and firms are reluctant to have someone other than the person experienced in
                                that security take over if the experienced trader is unavailable.
                                     Unavailability can result from sudden illness, religious holidays, jury duty, or vacation. In
                                these instances, the member may apply for an excused withdrawal until the experienced trader
                                returns. Both application and response are made electronically via a Nasdaq terminal.
                                     Other reasons for seeking an excused withdrawal include equipment malfunction, invol-
                                untary failure to maintain a clearing agreement, legal considerations, and the requirements of
                                Regulation M (discussed in the supervision of investment banking unit). If an excused with-
                                drawal results from failure to maintain a clearing agreement, the firm may re-enter Nasdaq as
                                soon as a new clearing agreement is established.
                                     If granted, excused withdrawals generally cover no more than five business days. If granted
                                based on legal considerations, the time frame can be up to 60 calendar days.

                    EXAMPLE                          If a market maker comes into possession of inside information on the subject
                                                 security, FINRA will immediately excuse the firm from continuing to make a market.

                                    Seeking an excused withdrawal due to a sudden influx of orders, sudden price changes, or
                                a pending news announcement is not permitted. If found to be in violation of FINRA rules,
                                FINRA can suspend or terminate a market maker.

                    EXAMPLE                           If a market maker fails to enter quotes within five business days after registra-
                                                 tion is effective, the firm will be involuntarily terminated as a market maker in that
                                                 security.

                                     In contrast, a market maker may want to voluntarily terminate its registration in a particu-
                                lar security. To do so, the market maker withdraws its quotes from Nasdaq. This alerts FINRA
                                that the member wants to terminate registration in that security. Should the member wish
                                to reregister as a market maker in that security, it must wait at least 20 business days (from
                                termination date).

                                    make a market in the issuer’s securities. Compensation includes cash, loans, stock in the issuer,
                                    and so forth. This prohibition extends to affiliates of the issuer, as well as to promoters engaged

       4. 4. 4                  LEVELS OF NASDAQ SERVICE
                                    Once registered with FINRA, market makers display their quotes and interact with other
                                market makers, other members, and the investing public through Nasdaq, a computer and tele-
                                communication network. The workhorse of Nasdaq is Workstation, a terminal that facilitates
                                quotations, trade executions, and transaction reporting.
                                    A key to understanding quotations over Nasdaq is the inside market, which is the highest
                                bid and the lowest asked price. Customers wanting to buy stock at the market are looking for
                                the lowest asked price, while customers wanting to sell stock at the market are looking for the
                                highest bid.
                                    There are three levels of Nasdaq service available to subscribers. Level 1 service is for
                                registered representatives and individual investors. With Level 1, subscribers can view bid and
                                ask quotes on a security (the bid and ask quote shown on Level 1 is the inside market), last
                                sale information, and share volume statistics.

                                                     The inside market is sometimes referred to as the NBBO, which stands for na-
                                                 tional best bid and offer or top of the book.

                                    Level 2 service is for OTC traders and financial institutions (e.g., pension funds, invest-
                                ment companies). It displays the bid and ask quote, with size, for each market maker in a
                                particular security. It also shows last sale and share volume information.

                                                             A principal quote at the inside market could represent a pegged order, which
                                                       is a limit order that is automatically adjusted to follow the inside price. The price of
                                                       a pegged buy order always equals the highest bid, while the price of a pegged sell
                                                       order always equals the lowest offer. By entering a pegged order, market participants
                                                       provide liquidity at the NBBO.

                                                       because there are 100 shares fewer in the marketplace available.

                                                       Situation 2. If a retail customer of a member (not a market maker in ABCD)
                                                 wants to buy 100 shares of ABCD at the market, the firm, to fill the order, buys from
                                                 Market Maker 1 at 10.50 and sells the stock to its customer at 10.50 plus a $50 com-
                                                 mission. In this case, the member acted as an agent, matching buyer (their customer)
                                                 with a seller (Market Maker 1) and charging a commission.

                                                 manner. It could have bought 100 shares from Market Maker 1 at 10.50, put the
                                                 stock into its riskless principal account, and immediately moved it out of this account
                                                 to the customer’s account at 11 net. This type of transaction is termed a riskless
                                                 principal transaction (or a riskless and simultaneous transaction). It is riskless to the
                                                 member.
                                                       The only reason that the firm bought the stock was to fill a customer order, not
                                                 for its own investment purposes. It simultaneously buys the stock and sells it to its
                                                 customer with a markup. While this may appear to be a principal (dealer) trade, for
                                                 regulatory purposes, it is considered an agency transaction.

                                                      A riskless and simultaneous transaction occurs when a firm buys from a market
                                                 maker to fill a customer order and charges a markup. This transaction is subject to the
                                                 5% policy, and disclosure of the markup is required on the customer confirmation if
                                                 the security is traded on Nasdaq.
                                                      For example, if a customer places an order to buy 1,000 shares of XYZ from a
                                                 firm, and the firm does not make a market in XYZ, it may purchase the stock from a
                                                 market maker currently at the inside market. It then sells the stock to the customer
                                                 with a markup. As a riskless and simultaneous transaction, the markup must be dis-
                                                 closed.



       4. 4. 6                  VWAP
                                    When a buy-side customer places a particularly large order with the trading desk of a
                                member firm, the order will likely require many trades through the time allotted to fill. Large
                                orders have the potential to disrupt pricing and, if not effected well, could impact the market
                                negatively. How well that trading service is performed is often measured by using the Volume
                                Weighted Average Price, better known as the VWAP, as a measurement.
                                    The VWAP of a stock trade differs from the average price as higher volume trades have a
                                greater impact on the VWAP. For example, assume there are two trades in WXYZ stock: 100
                                shares at 20, and 300 shares at 21. The average price is $20.50, but the VWAP is $20.75, calcu-
                                lated as follows: 100 shares at 20 represents $2,000 in value, while 300 shares at 21 represents
                                $6,300 in value. The total value traded is $8,300. Dividing the total value traded ($8,300)
                                by the number of shares traded (400) results in a VWAP of $20.75. You will be expected to
                                calculate VWAP on the Series 24.
                                    FINRA rules require that members, once in receipt of a VWAP order, refrain from engag-
                                ing in any activity that compromises the customer’s interest in favor of the member’s propri-
                                etary trading interest. Members must also place information barriers to prevent the internal
                                disclosure of any VWAP order received. If a registered representative were to learn of a large,
                                potentially market-moving, VWAP order, the representative cannot solicit orders in that
                                stock. Only unsolicited orders are acceptable. Member firms who accept VWAP or similar
                                large orders are required to disclose in writing that the member may engage in hedging or

                  4. 5          NASDAQ TRADING RULES


                  4. 5. 1        CHARACTER OF QUOTATIONS
                                      As previously stated, once registered as a market maker in a NASDAQ stock, the member
                                 is obligated to maintain a firm two-sided quote. Further, it must be willing to buy or sell at least
                                 100 shares at its stated quote. If a market maker displays a quote size greater than 100 shares,
                                 it must, on receipt of an order from another member, be willing to buy or sell at least up to the
                                 size displayed.
                                      In addition, a market maker’s quote must be reasonably related to the prevailing market
                                 (the inside market). If a market maker’s quotes are not reasonably close to the prevailing
                                 market, FINRA will require the firm to re-enter its quotes. If it fails to do so, the firm will be
                                 terminated as a market maker in the security.
                                      NASDAQ features a price/time priority model to ensure all trades are fair and transparent
                                 for all market participants. All displayed limit orders are treated equally and are executed in
                                 the order in which they were received at the same price.


                        4. 5. 1. 1   Offers at Stated Prices-Firmness of Quotations (FINRA Rule 5220)
                                     All quotes entered by Nasdaq market makers must be firm for the size displayed. If a market
                                 maker fails to honor a stated quote, the market maker is backing away, which disrupts normal
                                 trading operations and is a rules violation. It is not only a violation of Rule 5220 but also 2010
                                 in that backing away is deemed inconsistent with high standards of commercial honor and
                                 principals of trade.
                                     There are, however, two situations in which a market maker does not have to honor a
                                 stated quote.
                                 ■■ If, prior to the time an order is received, the market maker enters a revised quote into
                                     Nasdaq, the quote on the screen (the previous quote) does not have to be honored.
                                 ■■ If, at the time an order is received, the market maker is in the process of executing a trade,
                                     and on completion of the trade immediately enters a revised quote into Nasdaq, the mar-
                                     ket maker does not have to honor the previous quote.

                                     The firmness of the quotations rule applies to covered securities, which are securities
                                 for which quantitative and last-sale information is available through an automated reporting
                                 system.
                                     FINRA prohibits the use of computer-generated quote updates if these systems are used
                                 to keep a market maker’s quote away from the inside market (auto quote policy). Automated
                                 updating is permitted when the update is to ensure that the market maker maintains the same

                                                      According to the firm quote rule, market makers are obligated to execute orders
                                                 at a price at least as favorable as their published quote, for an amount up to their
                                                 published size. The obligation to honor an order begins when the order is presented,
                                                 whether it is received through the phone or via an electronic communications net-

             4. 5. 1. 2             Prohibition from Locking or Crossing (FINRA Rule 6240)
                                    During the hours of 8:00 am to 6:30 pm ET, market makers are prohibited from display-
                                ing a bid for an NMS stock that either locks or crosses the market. A locked market is one in
                                which the inside bid (highest bid) and the inside offer (lowest asked price) are the same. A
                                crossed market is one in which the inside bid is higher than the inside offer.

                                                      Situation 1. If Market Maker 2 wants to update its quote to 30–30.13, the new
                                                 inside market will be 30-30, which is a locked market.
                                                      Situation 2. If Market Maker 2 wants to update its quote to 30.05–30.13, the
                                                 new inside market will be 30.05–30, which is a crossed market.
                                                      In Situation 1, if Market Maker 2 is anxious to buy stock at 30, it might want to
                                                 buy stock from Market Makers 1 and 4, both of which are offering stock at that price.
                                                 The same argument can be made in Situation 2. Why bid for stock at 30.05 when
                                                 stock can be bought from Market Makers 1 and 4 at 30?


             4. 5. 1. 3             Regulation SHO
                                    SEC Regulation SHO promulgates uniform rules for short sales and is a common topic
                                seen on the Series 24 exam.

                                4. 5. 1. 3. 1 Order Marking
                                    The Commission requires that sell orders in all equity securities be marked as long, short,
                                or short-exempt. Sales can be marked long only if the security to be delivered is in a good
                                control location, physically in the customer’s account, or the broker-dealer reasonably expects
                                the owner of the security will deliver it by the settlement date. If the customer borrows stock
                                to effect delivery, the order ticket must be marked short. Sales marked short-exempt are not
                                subject to the provisions of Regulation SHO.

                                4. 5. 1. 3. 2 Locate and Delivery Requirements (Rule 203)
                                    Before effecting a short sale in any equity security, firms must locate securities available
                                for borrowing. Regulation SHO prohibits a broker-dealer from accepting a short sale order in
                                any equity security from another person, or effecting a short sale for its own account, unless
                                the firm:
                                ■■ has borrowed the security or entered into an arrangement to borrow the security, or
                                ■■ has reasonable grounds to believe that the security can be borrowed for delivery on settle-
                                    ment. The firm must make and document the locate before effecting the short sale, regard-
                                    less of when seller’s short position may be closed out (e.g. purchasing the securities back
                                    the same day).

                                                     In accordance with Regulation SHO, customers are long if they own:
                                                     ■■ the subject securities;

                                                     ■■ convertible securities and have issued conversion instructions;

                                                     ■■ options and have issued exercise instructions; or

                                                     ■■ rights or warrants and have issued exercise instructions.

                                                     Note that a person long a securities futures contract is not considered to own the
                                                 underlying security until the contract stops trading and the futures contract settles by
                                                 physical delivery.
                                                     Customers who are long and short the same security are considered long to the
                                                 extent of the net long position only. This is important to note during the 20 business
                                                 days a tender offer is underway.


                                4. 5. 1. 3. 3 Exceptions to the Locate Requirement
                                    There are several exceptions to the locate requirement. First, market makers are exempt
                                in connection with bona fide market-making activities. Next, the locate requirement does not
                                apply to a short sale order received from another broker-dealer. For example, if an introducing
                                firm places a short sale order through its clearing firm, it is the responsibility of the introducing
                                firm, not the clearing firm, to determine that the security being shorted can be borrowed to
                                effect delivery.

                                                      Short sales by primary market makers in connection with bona fide market mak-

                                    Another exception occurs in the following scenario: if a convertible security, option, or
                                warrant has been tendered for conversion/exercise but the security is not reasonably expected
                                to be received by settlement date, the locate requirement does not apply. Under SEC rule 203,
                                delivery must be made within 35 calendar days of trade date. If not, the firm that handled the
                                sale must take immediate steps to close out the fail to deliver by purchasing or borrowing the
                                securities.

                            !                        When a seller does not deliver the sold securities by the transaction’s settlement
                                                 date, the broker-dealer has established a “fail to deliver.”
                                                     This 35-calendar-day rule also applies to stock sold under Rule 144. Once the
                                                 holding period requirements have been met, a customer may sell the stock long, even
                                                 though it will likely take longer than the standard settlement cycle for the stock to

                                4. 5. 1. 3. 4 Available Securities List (Easy-to-Borrow List)
                                    Securities lending companies, provide securities to facilitate short sales. These firms pub-
                                lish and circulate lists to broker-dealers to identify securities easily available for borrowing.
                                Such a list may be used to provide assurance that the securities may be borrowed to effect
                                delivery. The short sale rule requires that to be useful, these available securities lists must be
                                updated every 24 hours.

                                                     Lists of securities available for borrowing (easy-to-borrow) allow broker-dealers
                                                 to make affirmative determination on a blanket rather than on an individual basis.
                                                 With regards to the reasonable grounds test, FINRA finds this practice acceptable but
                                                 only if the list is updated daily.


                                4. 5. 1. 3. 5 Hard-to-Borrow List
                                      In making an affirmative determination for short sales, firms create a “hard-to-borrow”
                                list, which identifies securities that are in limited supply and difficult or impossible to borrow.
                                It cannot be presumed that if a security is not on this list, it can be borrowed for short sale
                                purposes. Like an easy-to-borrow list, a hard-to-borrow list must be updated daily. Practically
                                speaking, just because a security is not on the hard-to-borrow list does not by itself satisfy the
                                reasonable grounds test of Rule 203. A hard-to-borrow list can only be used for Global Market
                                securities and exchange-listed securities. For Capital Market stocks, a member must use an
                                easy-to-borrow list.

                                4. 5. 1. 3. 6 Threshold Securities and Short Sale Delivery Requirements
                                     A threshold security is any equity security of an issuer where, for five consecutive settle-
                                ment days, there are fails to deliver at a registered clearing agency of 10,000 shares or more,
                                and the level of fails is equal to at least one-half of one percent of the issue’s total shares out-
                                standing. The appropriate SRO updates its threshold security list daily. A security ceases to
                                be a threshold security if it does not meet or exceed the specified levels for five consecutive
                                settlement days.
                                     According to FINRA Rule 4320, if a market maker or any participant of a clearing agency
                                registered with the SEC (e.g., the NSCC) has a fail to deliver position in a threshold security
                                open for 10 business days after settlement (13 consecutive settlement days), the firm must
                                immediately close the position by purchasing the securities, or it may not engage in any short
                                selling activities without first having borrowing or entering into a bona fide agreement to bor-
                                row the security.

                                    days and a firm has an open fail position in that security for those days, Regulation SHO does
                                    not require a closeout.
                                        In addition, if a market maker has a fail to deliver in a threshold security for 13 consecu-
                                    tive settlement days, it may not effect another short sale in that security until it either closes
                                    out the fail by purchasing the securities or pre-borrows the stock. In this case, it can enter a
                                    short sale only to the extent of its borrowing. If the security is not borrowable and the firm is
                                    unable to purchase the securities, it may have to seek an excused withdrawal from FINRA,
                                    because being prohibited from short selling effectively precludes the firm from acting as a
                                    market maker.
                                        The closeout and preborrow requirement does not apply to a net syndicate short position
                                    in a threshold security as long as the syndicate takes steps to close out the short by the 30th
                                    calendar day following the effective date of the offering.
                                        Lastly, if a firm accepts a sell order and the ticket is marked long, the firm must make deliv-
                                    ery when due and cannot use borrowed securities to do so. This prevents naked short selling,
                                    which is selling long without a position in the security. The intent is to buy back later the same
                                    day. In this case, the ticket should have been marked short, and the locate requirement should
                                    have been met to satisfy SEC Rule 203.

                        4. 5. 1. 4      SEC Rule 204
                                         To further address “naked” short selling, or short selling without a borrow, the SEC enacted
                                    Rule 204 of Regulation SHO in 2009. Rule 204 requires participants in NSCC’s Continuous
                                    Net Settlement System (CNS) to close out any fail to deliver position that exists on the trade’s
                                    settlement date for any equity security. This is true for both long and short sales. If the fail to
                                    deliver resulted from a long sale or in connection with bona fide market-making activities, the
                                    position must be closed out by the beginning of regular trading hours on the third business day
                                    after settlement (S+3). If, however, the fail to deliver resulted from a short sale, the position
                                    must be closed out by the beginning of regular trading hours on the first business day after
                                    settlement (S+1). A close out would be accomplished through either purchasing or borrowing
                                    securities of like kind and quantity.

                                                    securities, then the fail to deliver must be closed out on T+6, because regular way
                                                    settlement for equities is T+3. If, however the trade was executed with cash settle-

                                4. 5. 1. 4. 1 Pre-Borrow Penalty
                                    If a participant fails to close out an open fail by the deadline, Rule 204 imposes restrictions
                                on a broker-dealer to effect future short sales in that security. A broker-dealer working outside
                                Rule 204 is required to first borrow (or set up an agreement to borrow) the stock before accept-
                                ing any short sales orders either for customers or for their own proprietary trading account.
                                The pre-borrow penalty remains in effect until the open “fail” is closed out by actually buying
                                the stock.

                                4. 5. 1. 4. 2 Pre-Fail Credit
                                   A broker-dealer may avoid a close-out requirement or pre-borrow penalty by buying
                                enough shares to offset the fail.

                                4. 5. 1. 4. 3 Key Points of Rule 204
                                   The following are key points to remember regarding Rule 204.
                                ■■ Rule 204 applies to all equity securities.
                                ■■ The purchase or borrow of securities will not qualify as a closeout if the participant knows
                                   the securities will not actually be delivered by settlement.
                                ■■ Rule 204 requires that BDs track all fails to deliver from both long and short sales, and
                                   then borrow or buy-in a sufficient amount of stock to close out the fails at the beginning
                                   of regular trading on S+1 (in the case of short sales) and S+3 (in the case of long sales).
                                ■■ If the BD does not close out the position within that time period, it may be temporarily
                                   barred from effecting short sales in that stock for any customer unless it pre-borrows that
                                   stock.
                                ■■ Closeout requirements do not apply to Rule 144 stock.

                                        4. 5. 1. 4. 4 Exceptions to the Locate Requirement
                                            There are several exceptions to the locate requirement. First, market makers are exempt
                                        in connection with bona fide market-making activities. Next, the locate requirement does not
                                        apply to a short sale order received from another broker-dealer. For example, if an introducing
                                        firm places a short sale order through its clearing firm, it is the responsibility of the introducing
                                        firm, not the clearing firm, to determine that the security being shorted can be borrowed to
                                        effect delivery.
                                            Another exception occurs in the following scenario: if a convertible security, option, or war-
                                        rant has been tendered for conversion/exercise, but the security is not reasonably expected to be
                                        received by settlement date, the locate requirement does not apply. Under SEC rules, delivery
                                        must be made within 35 calendar days of trade date. If not, the firm that handled the sale must
                                        take immediate steps to close out the fail by purchasing or borrowing the securities.
                                            This 35-calendar-day rule also applies to stock sold under Rule 144. Once the holding
                                        period requirements have been met, a customer may sell the stock long, even though it will
                                        likely take longer than the standard settlement cycle for the stock to come back from the
                                        transfer agent free of any restrictions.

                        4. 5. 1. 5          Closeout of Short Sales
                                             Long sales not resulting in delivery must be closed out (i.e., bought in) after 10 business
                                        days from settlement. Short sales not resulting in delivery are covered by Regulation SHO.
                                        If a particular issue of stock has a significant number of shares that have been shorted and
                                        not delivered, it is termed a threshold security. If a market maker has a fail to deliver in a
                                        threshold security open for 13 consecutive settlement days, Regulation SHO requires that the
                                        position be closed out by purchasing the securities. If the security is not on the threshold list,
                                        closeout is not required.

                                    Short positions in both customer and proprietary accounts must be reported to FINRA

                                    On-the-open orders can be market orders or limit orders. They can be entered as early as
                                7:00 am and must be entered before 9:28 am.

                                    The closing cross rules are designed to create a single closing price much like the exchanges.
                                On-the-close orders can be market orders or limit orders. They can be accepted immediately
                                after the market opens until 3:50 pm.


       4. 5. 2                   CUSTOMER LIMIT ORDER PROTECTION RULE
                                 (THE MANNING RULE)
                                     The FINRA customer limit order protection rule (Manning Rule) applies to exchange-
                                listed and OTCBB securities. The intent of this rule is that market makers have a responsibil-
                                ity to provide best execution for their customers’ limit orders, if they choose to accept them,
                                whether through their market making capacity or sent to or received from another member.




                     *
                    EXAMPLE                           There is no requirement for a market maker to accept a limit order, but if it does,
                                                 the firm cannot continue to trade the security for its own account at prices that would
                                                 satisfy the customer’s limit.

                                    If a member firm executes a trade for its own account at or through a customer’s limit order
                                price, the firm must execute the customer’s limit order within one minute. The firm need not
                                execute a larger order for a customer than it executes for its own account.

                                                     A market maker is holding a customer limit order to buy 1,000 shares at 20. If the
                                                 market maker buys 400 shares for the firm’s account at 20, the firm also must execute
                                                 400 shares of the customer’s limit order at 20.

                                    Customer limit orders must be executed promptly after eligibility.

                                             All customer limit orders that a firm receives, either from its own customers or from
                                        another broker-dealer (member-to-member orders), are subject to this interpretation.
                                             Member-to-member limit orders are considered customer orders, not proprietary orders.
                                        Firm orders entered with a market maker for the firm’s proprietary account are not protected
                                        under this rule.
                                             Limit orders are protected between 9:30 am and 6:30 pm. That is, during those hours,
                                        members must handle their customer limit orders with care so members do not trade ahead of
                                        those limit orders. This is true for those customer limit orders received from their own custom-
                                        ers or from another member, in that they are prohibited from trading at prices equal or superior
                                        to the customer’s limit order without executing the limit order. They are not protected 24
                                        hours a day.
                                             A recent amendment to the Manning Rule provides further benefit to customers. Before
                                        the amendment, a member holding a customer limit to buy at 31.01 who, as principal, bought
                                        at 31.00, could fill the order at either 31.00 or 31.01. Now, the member must pass along any
                                        price improvement it received in the execution of its order to the customer order. In this case,
                                        the member must fill the customer order at 31.00.
                                             In a similar vein, FINRA Rule 5320 prohibits firms from trading ahead of customer mar-
                                        ket (or marketable limit) orders. The rule prohibits a firm that accepts and holds a customer
                                        market order from trading for its own account at prices that would satisfy the customer market
                                        order unless the firm immediately executes the customer order. This applies to exchange-listed
                                        as well as Nasdaq securities.

                                                        at that price. Similarly, if Firm A bought shares for its own account below the inside

                                ■■ Not held or working orders (the dealer is given discretion as to the price and time of the
                                   execution)

                                    These exemptions are permitted provided the terms and conditions have been communi-
                                cated fully to a customer before or at the time an order is accepted and the customer approves.
                                Trading along agreements must be on an order-by-order basis. There can be no blanket agree-
                                ments. An Intermarket Sweep Order (ISO) is exempted from limit order from the Order
                                Protection Rule. Customers, typically professional buy-side traders, require their orders to be
                                executed in one market even if there is a better quote elsewhere. This may be done as part of
                                an algorithmic trading scheme.


       4. 5. 4                  ORDER PRIORITY METHOD
                                    Provided the methodology is applied consistently, a firm may choose any reasonable way
                                to execute the multiple limit orders it holds. Additionally, firms are not required to allocate
                                execution between limit orders at the same price.
                                    A firm may not knowingly favor its own customer limit orders over limit orders it accepts
                                from other firms on behalf of their customers.




       4. 5. 5

                    EXAMPLE                          A firm has two limit orders to buy 300 shares of ABCD at 20. If the market maker
                                                 then buys 200 shares at 20, one of the two limit orders must be executed for 200
                                                 shares. There is no need to give execution to the other.



                                PRICE PROTECTION OF CUSTOMER LIMIT ORDERS
                                    When a firm accepts a limit order from one of its retail customers that includes a com-
                                mission, commission equivalent, markup, or markdown in the limit order price, the firm must
                                protect the limit order at its stated limit order price, or net price.




                     *
                    EXAMPLE                          If a customer enters a limit order to buy and requests that total costs not exceed
                                                 $11 per share, and if the customer is informed of a markup of .25, the customer
                                                 order would be deemed a limit order at $10.75. The price at which the limit order is
                                                 protected must be clearly explained to the customer.

                                    Market maker trades are not affected by ticket, clearing, or other charges. If a market
                                maker, as principal, buys 500 shares at 15, incurring costs equal to .02 cents per share, it must
                                protect customer limit orders at 15, not 15.02.

                                                     to buy 400 shares at 30.10, it must, within 30 seconds, update its Nasdaq quote to
                                                     30.10–30.25 4 x 10.
                                                         If the market maker were to receive an order to buy 400 shares at 30, it would
                                                     have to update its quote size to 14 x 10.

                                         There are several exceptions to the limit order display rule. If a limit order is of de minimis
                                    size (10% or less of the market maker’s displayed size), no display is required as long as the
                                    market maker is at the inside market.




                                *
                                EXAMPLE                  If a market maker at the inside is quoting 36.36–36.50 20 x 10 and receives

                                                     shares), it is not required to update its displayed size. However, the order still must be
                                                     protected.

                                       Other exceptions to the display rule include:

                                    ■■ odd-lot limit orders;

                                    ■■ orders that are delivered to an eligible ECN.

                                         An ECN is a trading system operated by members, not FINRA. ECNs can be eligible or

                                    ■■ If a market maker enters a quote (priced better than its current quote) into an ineligible
                                       ECN, it must update its Nasdaq quote.

       4. 5. 6                  INFORMATION BARRIERS
                                    Similar to what was discussed in Unit 2 about information barriers being placed between
                                analysts in the capital markets department and other departments, those member firms that
                                have proprietary trading desks in addition to market-making trading desks must also create
                                information barriers. The purpose of this barrier is to prevent information regarding customer
                                limit orders from reaching the proprietary desk. With such a safeguard in place, the proprietary
                                desk could unknowingly trade at prices at or better than customer limit orders without violat-
                                ing FINRA rules.

                                                     If information barriers are in place, a non-market-making desk within a firm could
                                                 trade ahead of a customer limit order without a violation, because the desk would
                                                 have no knowledge of the customer limit orders accepted by the trading department.



       4. 5. 7                  PRICE IMPROVEMENT
                                    Customer limit orders need not be executed if a market maker provides price improvement.




                     *
                    EXAMPLE                           A market maker is quoting ABCD stock at 8–8.25, and a customer enters a limit
                                                 order to buy 200 shares of ABCD at 8.05. Another customer enters a market order
                                                 to sell 500 shares at 8.10. The market maker can fill the customer sell order at 8.10
                                                 without executing the limit order, because price improvement of .05 was provided.

                                     The rules for price improvement are as follows: for limit orders that are priced at $1 or
                                more and are at or inside the best inside market, the minimum price improvement required
                                is $.01. For limit orders priced at less than $1 and that are at or inside the best inside market,
                                the minimum price improvement required is the lesser of $.01 or one-half the current inside
                                spread.



       4. 5. 8                  SEC LIMIT ORDER DISPLAY RULE (SEC RULE 604)
                                    The SEC limit order display rule appertaining to all NMS stocks requires that a market
                                maker immediately publish and display in its quotation the price and full size of each customer
                                limit order it holds that:
                                ■■ is priced better than its current quote; or
                                ■■ adds to the size associated to the quote.

                                    The display rule requires market makers to update their quotes immediately to reflect
                                customer limit orders. Immediately is defined as within 30 seconds of receiving an order under
                                normal market conditions. The 30 seconds begin when the individual trader responsible for
                                quoting the order receives it, not when a registered representative receives the order from the
                                customer. This 30-second rule does not apply to market openings or shortly thereafter, when
                                trading begins after a trading halt, or when an initial public offering begins trading.

                                 EXAMPLE                    A market maker’s quote for ABCD stock is 10.50–10.75, 10 × 10. If the mar-
                                                        ket maker receives a limit order to buy 200 shares at 10.60, the market maker must
                                                        update its quote to 10.60–10.75, 2 × 10 within 30 seconds. However, if the market
                                                        maker receives a limit order to buy 200 shares at 10.50, the market maker must up-
                                                        date its quote to 10.50–10.75, 12 × 10 within 30 seconds.

                                            An exception to the limit order display rule exists if the customer’s limit order is less than
                                        or equal to 10% of the market maker’s displayed quote size (de minimis size). In this situation,
                                        updating the quote to reflect the size of the limit order is not required. This exception applies
                                        only if the market maker is at the inside market at the time of order receipt.




                                  *
                                 EXAMPLE                    A market maker’s quote for ABCD stock is 10.50–10.75, 20 × 10. If the market
                                                        maker receives a limit order to buy 100 shares at 10.50, the displayed size does not
                                                        have to be updated, because the order is less than or equal to 10% of the market
                                                        maker’s displayed quote size. However, the order still must be protected.


                        4. 5. 8. 1          Exceptions to the Display Rule
                                           The limit order display rule does not apply to:
                                        ■■ customer limit orders executed upon receipt;
                                        ■■ limit orders when customers request that they not be displayed;
                                        ■■ special orders, including odd lot orders, and all-or-none limit orders;
                                        ■■ block-sized orders (at least 10,000 shares); and
                                        ■■ limit orders delivered immediately to an ECN that complies with the ECN display alterna-
                                           tive.


                        4. 5. 8. 2          ECN Display Alternative
                                            Before the implementation of the limit order handling rules, market makers could use
                                        ECNs to create hidden markets. This allowed market makers to quote a better price on an
                                        ECN than they were quoting through Nasdaq. The ECN amendment requires that a market
                                        maker quoting a better price in an ECN update its Nasdaq quote to reflect the improved price.
                                            A market maker can satisfy this requirement by using a linked or an eligible ECN, which
                                        allows automatic communication to the Nasdaq system and gives other market makers or
                                        dealers access to the orders. Even those members who do not subscribe to the ECN must have
                                        access. Ineligible ECNs do not automatically communicate to Nasdaq.

                                    Sending an order to an ECN does not relieve a member of its obligation to protect cus-
                                tomer orders under the Manning Limit Order Protection Rule. A member firm cannot trade
                                ahead of customer limit orders sent to ECNs.
                                    In an Order Handling Release, the SEC stated that if a market maker holding an undis-
                                played limit order receives a market order from the opposite side of the market, the firm must
                                execute the market order at the undisplayed limit price.

                                                 firm receives a market order to sell stock, the SEC Release requires that it be executed
                                                 at 17.33.

                        4. 5. 8. 3      Trading Along
                                        Trading along allows a market maker (or DMM) to buy or sell an agreed-upon amount at
                                    a price that would satisfy an institution’s order to buy or sell.




                                *
                                EXAMPLE                  An institution places an order to buy 100,000 shares of a stock at 26.45. If
                                                    60,000 shares become available at that price and the market maker has an agreement
                                                    in place to trade along on a 50-50 basis, the market maker would take 30,000 shares
                                                    and the institution the remaining 30,000 shares.
                                                         Without an agreement with the institution, the market maker, under the limit
                                                    order protection rule, would be obligated to execute the entire order for the institu-
                                                    tion’s account.

                                        Under FINRA rules, trading along agreements must be on an order-by-order basis. There
                                    can be no blanket agreements.


                  4. 5. 9           FRONT RUNNING (FINRA RULE 5270)
                                        If a member or any associated person has nonpublic knowledge of an impending block
                                    order to buy or sell, that member or person cannot place an order in front of the block order.
                                        This prohibition applies not only to proprietary accounts but also to employee and
                                    employee-related accounts and accounts over which the member has been given discretionary
                                    authority. The front running prohibition extends not only to the security that is the subject of
                                    the block order, but also to options on that security. For purposes of this rule, a block order is
                                    an order for 10,000 shares or more.




                                *
                                EXAMPLE                 There have been cases in which a firm, to circumvent the rule, executed the block
                                                    order in pieces, each for less than 10,000 shares. Their defense was that they were
                                                    not buying in front of a block order to buy as there was, technically, no block order.
                                                    Needless to say, they succumbed in a Code of Procedure hearing.



                  4. 5. 10 TRADING AHEAD OF RESEARCH REPORTS
                                        Members are prevented from adjusting their inventory, either in a market-making account
                                    or a proprietary trading account, ahead of the release of a research report.




Series_24_9e_Rev_LEM.indb 257                                                                                                               5/27/2015 7:38:32 AM

                     *
                    EXAMPLE                            A member is about to issue a rating upgrade for XYZZ. Knowing that the release
                                                 will trigger an inflow of big orders, the member increases its position in anticipation of
                                                 filling orders from inventory. According to FINRA, this action would not be in the best
                                                 interest of the investing public.

                                    FINRA recommends, but does not require that members maintain an information barrier
                                to prevent a market making or proprietary trading desk from obtaining advance knowledge of
                                impending research reports.



           TEST TOPIC ALERT
                            !                        Trading ahead is distinct from front running. Trading ahead always concerns
                                                 research reports; front running involves placing an order for a firm or employee before
                                                 a customer order.



       4. 5. 11 MANIPULATIVE QUOTATIONS
                                     Member firms are prohibited from publishing, by any means, any report of a securities
                                transaction unless the member knows or has reason to believe that the transaction was bona
                                fide (actually occurred). Similarly, members are prohibited from publishing, by any means, any
                                quotation for a security unless they believe the quotation is bona fide.
                                     Members also are prohibited from entering orders that are designed to mark the close.
                                Marking the close means entering orders or falsely reporting trades to affect the closing price
                                of a security.
                                     Similarly, members are prohibited from telling customers that a security is being offered
                                to them at the market unless the member has reason to believe that a market exists for the
                                security other than the market created by that member.

                                                      A manipulative act is distinct from a prohibited act in that manipulation is
                                                 designed to induce investors to take an action that they would otherwise not take.
                                                 For example, painting the tape is the practice of buying and selling a specific stock,
                                                 creating the illusion of high trading volume and significant investor interest. This can
                                                 attract unsuspecting investors into buying the stock. Painting the tape is sometimes
                                                 referred to as wash sales—that is, buying and selling the same stock at the same price
                                                 to create the illusion of activity.

                                    Furthermore, FINRA Rule 6140 specifically prohibits members from executing or partici-
                                pating in an account for which there are executed purchases of any NMS stock at successively
                                higher prices, or sales at successively lower prices, for the purpose of creating an artificial
                                appearance of activity in the stock for the purpose of improperly influencing the market price
                                of the security for the purpose of establishing a price that does not reflect the true state of the
                                market in a security.

                                   Examples of that kind of prohibited behavior include:
                                ■■ executing any transaction in a security that involves no change in beneficial ownership; or
                                ■■ entering an order to buy a security with the knowledge that an order of substantially the
                                   same size and price for the sale of the security has been or will be entered by or for the same
                                   or different parties, or vice versa (entering an order for the sale knowing that an order of
                                   substantially the same size and price for the purchase of the security has been or will be
                                   entered).

                                     Member firms may not execute purchases or sales of any NMS security for any account in
                                which it has an interest that is excessive in view of the member’s financial resources or in view
                                of the market for the security.
                                     Members may not participate or have any interest in the profits of a manipulative opera-
                                tion or knowingly manage or finance a manipulative operation, including any pool, syndicate,
                                or joint account organized or used intentionally for the purpose of unfairly influencing the
                                market price of NMS securities or making loans to a pool in a margin account.
                                     No member or associated person may hold any interest in any joint account for buying or
                                selling an NMS security, unless the joint account is reported promptly to FINRA. The report
                                must contain the following information:
                                ■■ Name of the account, with names of all participants and their respective interests in profits
                                     and losses
                                ■■ A statement regarding the purpose of the account
                                ■■ Name of the member carrying and clearing the account
                                ■■ A copy of any written agreement or instrument relating to the account

                                    No member may offer that a transaction or series of transactions to buy or sell an NMS
                                security will influence the closing transaction in that security. They are also not permitted to
                                bluff by placing big orders for stocks, bonds, or futures in order to get others to think the price
                                will rise (or fall) and then cancel the order and do the opposite; this is a practice known as
                                spoofing.


                  4. 5. 12 NASDAQ TRADING HALTS
                                    Nasdaq provides real-time surveillance of issuer activity by reviewing press releases and
                                monitoring price and volume activity. Nasdaq issuers must give FINRA prior notice of any
                                material news before its release. FINRA recommends that issuers provide information at least
                                10 minutes before public disclosure.
                                    Nasdaq MarketWatch has the authority to implement temporary trading halts to allow for
                                even dissemination of material news.
                                    When a temporary trading halt has been implemented, MarketWatch notifies the news
                                wires and all markets where the Nasdaq stock or derivatives are listed. No FINRA members
                                may trade during the trading halt, whether interdealer or customer, solicited or unsolicited.
                                Any trading during a halt violates FINRA Rule 5260, which prohibits members from effecting
                                transactions or publishing quotes during a time when a trading halt is in effect.

             4. 5. 12. 1 Other Trading Suspensions
                                    Nasdaq also suspends trading in conjunction with all SEC suspensions, regulatory suspen-
                                sions, and cease trade orders (CTOs) from other regulators. Trading halts vary in length, but
                                trading normally resumes 30 minutes after the media’s complete dissemination of the news.
                                These codes apply to two market categories: (1) NASDAQ-Listed Securities, which carry the
                                code of “N,” and (2) exchange-listed securities with the market category code “C.”


       4. 5. 13 TRADING HALT CODES
                                    Once trading stops, MarketWatch updates the trading halt status on the Nasdaq News
                                frame. The following codes reflect the status of trading halts, suspensions, and CTOs in Nasdaq
                                and non-NASDAQ securities.
                                    T1 Halt—News pending: Trading is halted pending the release of material news.
                                    T2 Halt—News released: The news has begun the dissemination process through a
                                Regulation FD compliant method(s).
                                    T3 Halt—Resumption times: The news has been fully disseminated through a
                                Regulation FD-compliant disclosure method. Nasdaq determined that system misuse or mal-
                                function that caused extraordinary market activity no longer has a material effect on the
                                market for the security, or that system misuse or malfunction is not the cause of the extraordi-

                                quotations, followed by (2) the time the security will be released for trading. All trade halt and
                                resumption times will be posted in HH:MM:SS format.

                                     In customer transactions, a firm must determine, whether acting as agent for the account
                                of its customer or where transactions are executed as principal, the best market for a security
                                and buy or sell so that the resulting price to the customer is as favorable as possible under pre-
                                vailing market conditions.
                                     In reviewing customer transactions, FINRA will consider the following to determine
                                whether members are executing in the best available market:
                                ■■ Character of the market for the security (e.g., price, volatility, and liquidity)
                                ■■ Size and type of transaction
                                ■■ Number of markets checked
                                ■■ Accessibility of quotations

                                    Best execution means more than best price; execution quality (which includes speed of
                                execution, fill rates, price improvement, and so forth) also is important. Member firms are
                                required to have procedures in place to monitor their trade executions and to take action
                                where appropriate.

                                                      The best execution rules apply not only to your customers but also to customers
                                                 of other member firms that are routing their customer orders to your firm for order
                                                 handling and execution.

                                    When acting in an agency capacity for a customer, a member firm cannot place a third
                                party between itself and the best available market (members cannot route an order through
                                another firm). They must go directly to the best available market (to a firm at the inside
                                market).
                                    Generally, interpositioning results in a less-favorable price to the customer, as the third
                                party will trade at the inside market and then add additional costs for itself.



           TEST TOPIC ALERT
                            !                         The only time interpositioning can be justified is if it results in a better execution
                                                 for the customer. Better means a lower price than the inside offer or a higher price
                                                 than the inside bid.

                                    Members cannot justify interpositioning by charging a lower-than-normal commission,
                                nor can they use inadequate staffing to justify this practice.

                                with order routing and order execution reporting, Rule 606 and 605, are described in order of
                                importance.

                                                      NMS stocks are defined as those trading on national and regional exchanges, as
                                                 well as Nasdaq equities. Regulation NMS does not apply to securities trading on the

                                    With regard to best execution, the SEC requires firms to publicly disclose their order rout-
                                ing methods. Firms are required to make public quarterly reports that identify:
                                ■■ the market centers to which they route a significant percentage of their orders; and
                                ■■ the nature of their relationships with these centers, including any payment for order flow
                                    arrangements or profit-sharing agreements.

                                    The quarterly reports must be divided into four types of securities: (1) NYSE-listed, (2)
                                other exchange listed, (3) Nasdaq equities, and (4) exchange-listed options.
                                    NMS Rule 606 only impacts nondirected orders, which are orders for which the firm
                                determines where the order is routed for execution. Directed orders, for which the customer
                                specifies the market or market center to which the order should be sent for execution, are not
                                covered by the rule.
                                    This SEC rule also mandates that firms disclose to customers, upon written request, where
                                their nondirected orders over the prior six months were routed for execution. Furthermore,
                                firms must notify their customers, in writing, at least annually of the availability of this
                                information.

                                4. 5. 15. 1. 1 Rule 606 Exemptions
                                    If a member firm routed 500 or fewer customer orders subject to Rule 606 in any month
                                during the most recent calendar quarter, they are exempt from reporting for that quarter.
                                For example, if Maximum Trade & Co. directed 1,400 orders in the quarter and no month
                                exceeded 500 directed orders, that member firm would be exempt from reporting that quarter.
                                    Furthermore, if orders sent to market centers amount to less than 5% of nondirected order
                                flow, no report is required.


                        4. 5. 15. 2 Regulation NMS Rule 605
                                   In addition to disclosure of order routing information, the SEC requires market centers to
                                make publicly available monthly reports on covered orders that include statistical measures of
                                execution quality. Reports are compiled by each stock exchange and Nasdaq. The securities
                                covered by this rule are exchange-listed equities and Nasdaq equities.
                                   The information required in these monthly reports includes data on:
                                ■■ the effective spreads;
                                ■■ how market orders of various sizes are executed relative to the public quotes;
                                ■■ rate of price improvement and price disimprovement;
                                ■■ fill rates; and
                                ■■ speed of execution.

                                   Only market and limit order executions, including marketable limit orders and IOC
                                (immediate or cancel) limit orders are included in these reports. Orders that require special
                                handling (such as FOK [fill or kill], not held, and average price orders) are excluded.

             4. 5. 15. 4 Regulation NMS Rule 611—The Order Protection Rule
                                    Regulation NMS, as we now know, was written with the view to bring trading and report-
                                ing uniformity to the various securities markets in the United States. Among the various rules
                                mandated by the SEC are Regulation NMS Rules 611 and 612. Rule 611, the order protection
                                rule, handles trade-throughs. A trade-through occurs when a firm executes a customer order at
                                a price when a better price is available. For example, if stock is being offered on the NYSE floor
                                at the top of the book price of $28.18, and a firm buys the stock on another market center at
                                $28.20, the firm traded through the best price available and disadvantaged its customer by two
                                cents per share. Although there are exceptions, Rule 611 prohibits trade-throughs.

                                                     Another unacceptable practice is prearranged trading. This is an offer to sell
                                                 matched with an offer to buy back (or vice versa) at the same price or some pre-
                                                 arranged price. These risk-free trades hold out the promise of certain tax advantages
                                                 otherwise not attainable in a fair and open market. Prearranged trading is prohibited.

                                    Rule 611(b) provides the following noteworthy exceptions to the trade-through provision
                                of the Order Protection Rule of Regulation NMS.
                                ■■ Stopped orders. From time to time, a block trader will use stopped order in an effort to
                                    guarantee a maximum (or minimum) price on a trade for an institutional customer. The
                                    portfolio manager, for instance, would know with certainty that he won’t pay more than a
                                    certain amount when buying or selling a particular stock.
                                ■■ Self Help. This exception permits a trading center (ATS or an exchange) to fill at a worse
                                    price due to delays caused by malfunctioning equipment.
                                ■■ Flickering quote due to rapidly changing price quotations. The SEC granted trading cen-
                                    ters a one-second quote window to evaluate the quotes of competing trading centers. If
                                    quotes are flickering, then the first trading center is permitted to execute at the least
                                    aggressive best bid or offer displayed by the flickering market center. For example, if the
                                    best bid on a market center is flickering between $20.50 and $20.51, then the first trading
                                    center can execute at $20.50 without violating rule 611.
                                ■■ Volume weighted average price (VWAP) orders. The rule also permits VWAP orders and
                                    market open, close, or reopening orders following a halt, or in other words, those orders
                                    that are not priced with any reference to a quoted price of a stock at the time of execution.
                                    More about VWAP is covered earlier in this Unit.

                                   Lastly, but arguably the most common exception to rule 611, is the Intermarket Sweep
                                Order (ISO).

                                   Intermarket Sweep Order (Incoming). This exception makes it possible for a trading
                                center to immediately execute any incoming order identified as an intermarket sweep order
                                (ISO), even if a better-priced protected quote exists at another market center as traders at-
                                tempt to fill customers’ block orders.

                                    Intermarket Sweep Order (Outgoing). This permits a broker-dealer to execute an
                                ISO at a price inferior to a protected quote. These are likely used when printing blocks for
                                customers away from the inside. The SEC permits a broker to use the ISO as long as it simul-
                                taneously attempts to remove better-priced protected quotes.

                                                       to the appropriate SIP, members would not be prohibited from trading through other

                        4. 5. 15. 5 Regulation NMS Rule 612—Sub-Penny Rule
                                            For NMS stocks trading at $1 or above, the minimum pricing increment is $.01. Sub-
                                        penny pricing is permitted for NMS stocks trading at less than $1. In this case, the minimum
                                        increment is $.0001. Note that OTCBB and OTC Pink stocks trading at any price can be
                                        quoted in sub-pennies. Also keep in mind that if a market maker or ECN receives an order
                                        quoted in sub-pennies, the order must be to a penny. For example, a market maker may accept
                                        order of $1.05 but not order of $1.051. Buy-limit orders are rounded down to the nearest
                                        penny, whereas sell-limit orders are rounded up to the nearest penny.

                  4. 5. 16 TRADES FOR MANAGED ACCOUNTS
                                            A managed account is one in which the member, for an annual fee (wrap fee), provides
                                        a variety of services to that account. Investment advisory accounts and wrap accounts are
                                        examples of managed accounts. Under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, member firms
                                        generally execute transactions with these accounts in stocks in which they are a market maker
                                        on an agency basis. However, they may act as principal but must make disclosure and obtain
                                        consent prior to completion of the trade.

                                            The SEC, after a lengthy investigation of the Nasdaq Stock Market, issued a report on cer-
                                        tain anticompetitive practices of certain market makers. The report, called the 21(a) Report,
                                        concluded there was serious collusion between market makers regarding:
                                        ■■ the setting of bid-ask spreads;
                                        ■■ the sharing of information regarding customer limit orders;
                                        ■■ the sharing of information regarding the release of research reports; and
                                        ■■ the sharing of information on trading strategies and inventory positions.

                                    In addition, market makers who did not participate were subject to harassment and other
                                forms of intimidation. The 21(a) Report mandated many changes in the rules and the manner
                                in which they are enforced.
                                    Any attempt to influence another member regarding quotations or spreads, or any conduct
                                that retaliates against or discourages the competitive activities of other members, is a gross
                                violation and can lead to suspension or expulsion.
                                    Another result of the 21(a) Report was the creation of Series 55, which is required for
                                Nasdaq market makers, proprietary OTC traders, and for persons who directly supervise these
                                activities.

                                                 other for the markets to work. Ghosting is subject to the severest of penalties.



       4. 5. 18 TIME SYNCHRONIZATION
                                    Members must synchronize business clocks daily. All computer system clocks must be syn-
                                chronized to within one second of the National Institute of Standards (NIST) atomic clock
                                and must remain accurate within a one-second tolerance of the NIST clock. (Check with your
                                instructor. There is a proposal to reduce the tolerance for computer clocks to 50 milliseconds.)

                                4. 5. 18. 5. 1 Order Information
                                   An OATS report must record the following information for NMS stocks:
                                ■■ Date and time of order receipt
                                ■■ Name of contra party (firm or customer)
                                ■■ Order identifier
                                ■■ Terms of the order
                                ■■ Where the order was routed for execution
                                ■■ Whether the order was modified
                                ■■ Execution price

                                    OATS reports for each trade in an NMS security must be submitted to FINRA daily.
                                FINRA then uses the OATS data to match against the execution reports submitted to TRF/
                                ACT, which is discussed in a following unit. Enabling the matching of OATS reports to trade
                                reports requires that each order have a unique identifier.


       4. 5. 19 FINRA RULE 5290
                                     Trade shredding is a term used to describe the practice of splitting customer orders into
                                multiple smaller orders (e.g., a 1,000-share order split into ten 100-share orders) to maximize
                                payment for order flow from the market maker to which the orders are directed. In other
                                words, the payment for order flow would be greater on ten 100-share orders than it would be
                                for a single 1,000-share order. Trade shredding is a prohibited practice.

                                     The Over the Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB) is an electronic interdealer quotation
                                 service for more than 3,300 issues that do not meet the listing requirements of stock mar-
                                 kets, such as NASDAQ and, therefore, fall outside the National Market System. As such, the
                                 OTCBB (which has no listing standards) acts as a non-NMS quotation service for OTC equity
                                 securities. Although the OTCBB has no listing requirements, there is an eligibility require-
                                 ment to be registered and current as a reporting company with the SEC in order to be quoted
                                 by a market maker. There only needs to be one market maker. Key features to the OTCBB
                                 include the following:
                                 ■■ Domestic securities not listed elsewhere
                                 ■■ Transmits real-time quote, price, and volume information
                                 ■■ Foreign equity securities and ADRs that are registered with the SEC
                                 ■■ Several hundred market makers
                                 ■■ Equity securities in the process of being delisted from an exchange or Nasdaq for noncom-
                                     pliance with maintenance listing standards;

                                                      Because the OTCBB is a quotation service for stocks that are not listed or traded
                                                 on Nasdaq or any other exchange, no stock can be traded on the OTCBB and Nasdaq

        4. 6. 2                  REGISTRATION AS OTC MARKET MAKER
                                    To register as a market maker in Bulletin Board securities, a member must file Form 211
                                with FINRA. The form, which is signed by a principal, attests to the firm’s compliance with
                                SEC Rule 15c2-11, which requires that a market maker obtain, maintain, and review financial
                                information on the issuer.
                                    Members must be knowledgeable about the issuer’s financial condition and operating his-
                                tory. File form 211 at least three business days in advance of entering quotations.
                                    In addition to attesting to having performed financial due diligence, the Form 211 filing
                                must include information on the member’s initial quotation if the quote is to be firm. The
                                member must provide a rationale for determining the priced entry.
                                    If the initial quotation is to be nonfirm, this information is not required. However, if the
                                member later wishes to enter a priced bid and/or offer, it must file a supplemental report with
                                FINRA describing the basis on which the priced entry was determined.
                                    The supplemental report must be received by FINRA at least three business days before
                                the priced entry appears.


             4. 6. 2. 1             Piggybacking
                                    A Form 211 filing is not required if the member is able to piggyback on the quotes of
                                another market maker. If an existing market maker in the security meets the continuous quote
                                rule, a new market maker can enter the Bulletin Board with quotations without having to file
                                Form 211.
                                    The continuous quote rule is applicable if:
                                ■■ an existing market maker has published quotes on the security on at least 12 business days
                                    during the preceding 30 calendar days; and
                                ■■ there have been no more than four consecutive business days during this 30-day period
                                    without a quotation.

                                    In this case, a new market maker can piggyback on the existing market maker’s quotes. If
                                the security has met the continuous quote rule, the word active appears on the screen next to
                                the symbol. If the word eligible appears, it means that an existing market maker has not yet met
                                the continuous quote rule, and a Form 211 filing would be required for a new market maker.

                                     A firm can enter the Bulletin Board without filing if the quote it enters represents unsolic-
                                 ited customer interest. Once that interest has been filled, the firm must withdraw or file Form
                                 211 to continue.

                                     Every quotation entry must include the phone number of the market maker’s trading desk.
                                If a firm has more than one trading location, a geographic indicator must be appended to the
                                market maker’s identifier to let subscribers know where the security is traded.
                                     Market makers can enter and update quotes on a real-time basis. Subscribers to the OTCBB
                                can access an inside market for a security as long as there are at least two market makers dis-
                                playing firm two-sided quotes. Priced quotations must be firm for a minimum number of shares
                                as shown. These quotation sizes apply to any IDQS that permits updates on a real-time basis.

                    EXAMPLE                           If a Bulletin Board market maker is quoting 11.10–11.60, it must be willing to buy
                                                 or sell at least 100 shares at these prices.

                    EXAMPLE                          Any increment beyond an upper limit triggers the minimum quote size for the
                                                 next tier. A bid (or offer) of $0.51 must be firm for a size of 1,000 shares.

                                   An exception to the firmness of quote rule is made for direct participation programs
                                (DPPs). Due to IRS regulations, a priced bid or offer for a DPP is never firm.


             4. 6. 2. 3             Regulatory Filing
                                     SEC rules require that all issuers whose securities are quoted on the Bulletin Board be
                                current in their regulatory filings. If an issuer is delinquent, the modifier E appears next to
                                its symbol. Once delinquent, the issuer has 30 days (if SEC reporting) or 60 days (if report-
                                ing to banking or insurance regulators) to become current. Otherwise, the issuers’ securities
                                are removed from the Bulletin Board until the appropriate filings have been made. When
                                removed, they will trade in the OTC Pink marketplace, which have no regulatory reporting
                                requirements.
                                     Although issuers of OTCBB-quoted securities have an SEC filing requirement, issuers
                                have no such requirement to file with the Nasdaq Stock Market or FINRA. Market makers, on
                                the other hand, are required to provide the periodic financial reports filed by OTCBB issuers
                                with the SEC or other regulatory authorities in order to maintain eligibility for being quoted
                                on the OTCBB.

                                     As there is no requirement for companies quoted in the OTC Pink marketplace to be cur-
                                 rent in their regulatory filings, this quotation medium is at the low end of transparency and
                                 disclosure.
                                     The OTC Pink marketplace offers a real-time quote system on the Web by the OTC
                                 Markets Group, Inc. It is registered with the SEC as an ATS. If a member firm wishes to make
                                 a market in an OTC Pink security, it must follow the rules applicable to Bulletin Board market
                                 makers (it too must file Form 211), unless an exception is available (e.g., piggybacking).
                                     Although the OTC Markets Group operates an ATS, it does not operate as an ECN or
                                 a dark pool. It is a network, and therefore does not charge fees on a per-share or transaction
                                 basis.

                                     A penny stock is a non-NMS, OTC equity security trading at less than $5 per share. A
                                 penny stock is a low-priced OTCBB or OTC Pink Market stock. The SEC rules on designated

                                word of caution, do not confuse this with the “Cheap Stock” rule promulgated by the NYSE
                                (Rule 431(c)(2)), which deals with margin requirements for stocks valued under $5 per share.
                                ■■ Rule 15(g)2 requires that customers, before their initial transaction in a penny stock, be
                                   given a copy of the Risk Disclosure Document. The member must receive written acknowl-
                                   edgment from the customer that the document has been received. Not surprisingly, the
                                   document describes penny stocks in less than flattering terms.
                                ■■ Rule 15(g)3 requires members to provide penny stock purchasers with a current bid and
                                   asked quote on the stock to prevent the practice of quoting prices that are away from the
                                   current market to customers.
                                ■■ Rules 15(g)4 and 15(g)5 require members to provide penny stock purchasers with infor-
                                   mation on the compensation to be earned by both the member and the registered repre-
                                   sentative as the result of the transaction. This is to prevent excessive markups.
                                ■■ Rule 15(g)6 requires members to provide penny stock purchasers with monthly state-
                                   ments showing the estimated market value of each penny stock purchased.
                                ■■ Rule 15(g)9 addresses sales practices to curb abusive selling. This rule requires members
                                   that are soliciting new customers to make a suitability determination. The member must
                                   inquire as to the prospective customer’s income, net worth, objectives, and risk tolerance
                                   and then prepare a suitability statement showing why the proposed penny stock trade is
                                   suitable for the customer. This statement must then be sent to the customer for a signature.
                                   Once returned, the member may effect the trade (send a confirmation).

                                    However, a member may solicit an established customer without having to prepare a suit-
                                ability statement. An established customer is one who has:
                                ■■ effected a non-penny stock transaction or made a deposit of funds or securities in an
                                    account at least one year before the proposed penny trade; or
                                ■■ made three unsolicited purchases of penny stocks, on three separate days, involving three
                                    separate issues. Once a customer buys three different penny stocks, he is no longer covered
                                    by the suitability statement requirement.

                                   In addition to the established customer exception, other exemptions from 15(g)9 include:
                                ■■ unsolicited trades;
                                ■■ transactions with institutional accredited investors;
                                ■■ private placements meeting the requirements of SEC Rule 505 or 506; and
                                ■■ transactions executed by a member whose revenue from penny stock trades is 5% or less
                                   of total revenue.

                                    With one exception, the exemptions previously noted also apply to the penny stock dis-
                                closure rules (15(g)2–15(g)6). The exception is for established customers who, while exempt
                                from 15(g)9, are subject to 15(g)2–15(g)6.


             4. 6. 2. 6             Reverse Convertible Bonds
                                     Reverse convertible bonds are debt instruments with embedded put options that allow
                                bond issuers the right to convert the bond’s principal into shares of equity at a predetermined
                                set date. The issuer would exercise the option if the shares underlying the option fell below a
                                set price. If this occurred, the bondholders would receive the shares rather than their principal
                                when the bond matured.

                                     Yields on these bonds are higher than similar bonds without the reverse convertible fea-
                                 ture due to the additional risk assumed by the bondholder. Keep in mind that due to this addi-
                                 tional risk, reverse convertible bonds should trigger suitability concerns, which were covered
                                 in an earlier unit.
                                     A comparison between these bonds and convertible bonds gives a clear picture of the logic
                                 behind their name.
                                     Whereas a convertible bond gives the shareholder the right to convert the bond to equity
                                 and receive shares of the issuer’s stock, the reverse convertible turns this around by giving the
                                 issuer the right to convert the bond to equity and pay those shares to the bondholder instead
                                 of cash when the bond matures.

                                                     Several testable points about the penny stock rules include the following.
                                                     ■■ Broker-dealers whose transactions in penny stocks account for 5% or less of
                                                        total revenues are exempt from the penny stock rules.

                                                     ■■ Established customers are exempt from the cold call rules (suitability
                                                        statement) but not from the disclosure rules.

                                                     ■■ The rules apply to Pink Sheet or Bulletin Board stocks under $5 per share
                                                        only.




                  4. 7          THE THIRD MARKET
                                      The Securities Acts Amendments of 1975 created the environment that led to the devel-
                                 opment of the third market. These amendments were designed to remove barriers to competi-
                                 tion among the exchanges and the over-the-counter market and foster the development of a
                                 national securities market and settlement system.
                                      One of the results of the act was that the NYSE rule requiring members to execute orders
                                 in listed stocks on the exchange floor was to be phased out over time. Thus, the NYSE became
                                 subject to competition from ECNs and over-the-counter member firms making a market in
                                 exchange-listed stocks. This is known as the Third Market; that is, listed stocks that trade
                                 OTC.


                  4. 7. 1        CONSOLIDATED QUOTATION SYSTEM (CQS)
                                     Once the third market developed, a system was needed to provide quotes from both third
                                 market makers and DMMs in listed stocks. The Consolidated Quotation System (CQS) pro-
                                 vides bid and ask quotes, with size, for NYSE and other exchange-listed equity securities.

       4. 8             TRADING SYSTEMS, PROCESSES

                                     Nasdaq Book is an order display and execution system for Nasdaq-listed securities. It
                                allows firms to list multiple quotes and orders for the same security and creates a single limit
                                order trading book. It was developed to address concerns regarding market fragmentation (dif-
                                ficulty in finding the best price) and decimalization (difficulty in accessing the depth of trading
                                interest in a stock). Overall, the system has created greater market transparency.
                                     Nasdaq Book displays the total amount of trading interest at the best prices (inside mar-
                                ket), as well as four price levels away, for a total of five price levels on the bid and offer sides
                                of the market. Each price level shows the aggregate trading interest at that level, including
                                attributable and nonattributable quotes/orders. If an order is attributable, the price and size of
                                the order is displayed next to the market participant’s unique identifier (MPID). In contrast,




Series_24_9e_Rev_LEM.indb 274                                                                                                             5/27/2015 7:38:34 AM

                                        if a market participant designates an order as nonattributable, it is not displayed next to its
                                        MPID. Rather, all nonattributable interest at a particular price level is aggregated and dis-
                                        played under a special anonymous MPID, NSDQ.
                                             The NSDQ MPID allows the firm placing the order to remain anonymous until execution,
                                        at which time the member’s name is revealed to the contra party. If a member submits a nonat-
                                        tributable quote/order and requests full anonymity, any execution is processed anonymously.
                                        While the transaction report indicates the details of the trade, it does not reveal the identity
                                        of the contra party.

                                        ■■ Level II shows all bid-and-ask quotes in a security with size for each quoting participant
                                           and is intended for use by traders and order entry firms.
                                        ■■ Level III allows market makers to update their quotes and/or size and includes all of the
                                           features of Levels I and II.

       4. 8. 2                  TIME STAMP
                                    Nasdaq, an ATS, ECN or regional stock exchange will time stamp each order or quote
                                upon receipt. The time stamp determines the ranking for execution purposes as orders at the
                                same price level are executed on a first in, first out basis. Each quote increment receives a
                                separate stamp to ensure that market participants will not lose time priority for updating their
                                displayed trading interest to show greater size.
                                    Remember that computer clocks must be synchronized to within one second (subject to
                                change) from the NIST atomic clock. Pre-stamping an order is a violation. For example, if a
                                trader feels certain that an order from a customer is coming down and wants to capture a price
                                now in anticipation of the order, he may be tempted to pre-stamp. It is a form of prearranged
                                trading and is also a violation of recordkeeping rules.




                     *
                    EXAMPLE                           When a market maker increases size at the same price level, the original quantity
                                                 will keep the original time stamp, and the additional quantity will have a new time
                                                 stamp. If a market maker decreases size at the same price level, the remaining amount
                                                 retains the original priority. Once a market maker’s displayed size is decremented to
                                                 zero, it no longer retains time priority, even though it may have reserve size (which is
                                                 not displayed) or a feature that automatically refreshes its displayed size.



       4. 8. 3                  DECREMENTATION
                                     Decrementation is quote size reduction resulting from executions. Upon execution, an
                                order is reduced by an amount equal to the size of that execution. If the displayed size is
                                reduced to less than one round lot and the market participant has reserve size, the displayed
                                size will be replenished from the reserve.

                                                      Market participants are required to display a minimum of 100 shares in order to
                                                 use reserve size. Also note that if a firm uses reserve size, the amount in reserve must
                                                 be at least 100 shares.
                                                      If a participant’s attributable interest is reduced to less than one round lot and the
                                                 firm has no reserve size, Nasdaq will zero out the exhausted side of the market for 30
                                                 seconds. During this period, the firm must update its quote. If, after 30 seconds, the
                                                 firm does not update its quote, Nasdaq will refresh its quote $.25 for 100 shares, to
                                                 one cent away from the worst-displayed price in QuoteView.
                                                      A Market Maker Peg Order is a one-sided, attributable limit order in which the
                                                 price is automatically adjusted, helping NASDAQ market makers comply with the
                                                 Exchange’s rules regarding market maker quotation requirements and obligations in
                                                 their registered securities.

                  4. 8. 4               NONDIRECTED, PREFERENCED, AND DIRECTED
                                        ORDERS
                                             To access quotes, market participants can enter, in addition to market and limit orders,
                                        one of the following types of orders: nondirected, preferenced, or directed. An order may be
                                        of a size up to 999,999 shares and must indicate whether it is a buy, sell, sell short, or sell short
                                        exempt. Orders can be in round lots, mixed lots, or odd lots.


                        4. 8. 4. 1          Nondirected Orders
                                            Nondirected orders are liability orders, which means they create an obligation for the
                                        recipient to either buy or sell. These orders must be market or marketable limit orders. A
                                        nondirected order will be matched with the highest-ranked quotes on the opposite side of the
                                        market, as shown in the following table.
                                            The Nasdaq Book will automatically match any nondirected buy and sell quotes/orders
                                        entered by order entry firms and market makers against the quotes/orders of those same firms
                                        on the other side of the market if such a quote/order is at the inside price.

                                     These are orders that are sent to a specific market participant that is at the inside market.
                                They interact with the selected firm’s display size as well as its reserve size. If the market par-

                                ing party. If a partial fill is received (after exhausting the selected firm’s displayed and reserve

                                are nonliability orders and, as such, must be for 100 shares greater than the display size with
                                an all-or-none (AON) designation, or delivered with a minimum acceptable quantity (MAQ)
                                of at least 100 shares greater than the display size. In this way, there is no obligation for the
                                recipient to execute. The recipient may, at its discretion, accept the order, partially fill the
                                order, counter the order, or decline the order.
                                    Directed orders also can be liability orders. Directed liability orders must be within the
                                market participant’s display size and price. Market participants that elect to receive directed
                                liability orders must have the modifier d next to their MPID. Other market participants can
                                elect not to receive directed liability orders. These orders must be responded to within five
                                seconds by the receiving firm.

                                                      Dual liability exists for firms that elect to accept directed liability orders. These
                                                 firms can have their quotes executed against through the nondirected order process
                                                 when at the inside market and, at the same time, be liable for directed liability orders
                                                 at the same quote.



       4. 8. 5                  EXECUTION ALGORITHMS
                                    NMC gives participants three options as to how their orders will interact with quotes in
                                the system: (1) price/time, (2) price/size/time, and (3) price/time with access fee consider-
                                ation. With price/time, the best price is accessed first, with the first and subsequent executions
                                based on time priority. With price/size/time, the best price is accessed first, with the first and
                                subsequent executions based on size. This means the largest sized quotes are executed first.
                                With price/time with access fee consideration, the order is executed as with price/time, but
                                any market participant that charges a fee is accessed last. Some ECNs charge a fee for execu-
                                tions against their quotes.

                                                 it as price/time.

                  4. 8. 6       TIME IN FORCE ORDERS (TIF)/DESIGNATIONS
                                ■■ Day orders. If, after entry into the system, the order is not executed, the order, or unex-
                                   ecuted portion, is returned to the entering firm at 4:00 pm.
                                ■■ Total day orders. If, after entry into the system, the order is not executed, the order, or
                                   unexecuted portion, is returned to the entering party at 8:00 pm. This order is designated
                                   as an X order, meaning it is good through extended hours trading. It is available for display
                                   beginning at 7:00 am.
                                ■■ Good-till-canceled orders (GTC). If, after entry into the system as GTC “market day,”
                                   the order is not executed, the order, or unexecuted portion, remains available for display
                                   and/or execution until market close at 4:00 pm. The order will remain in the system until
                                   canceled by the entering party, or until one year from entry, whichever comes first.
                                ■■ Total good-till-canceled orders (GTX). These are similar to GTC orders, except that the
                                   order is available for display/execution up until 8:00 pm.
                                ■■ Immediate-or-cancel orders (IOC). If, after entry into the system, a marketable limit, or
                                   unexecuted portion, becomes nonmarketable, the order, or unexecuted portion, is can-
                                   celed and returned to the entering party. These orders can be entered during normal mar-
                                   ket hours only.
                                ■■ Total immediate-or-cancel orders (IOX). These are similar to IOC orders, except that they
                                   are available for execution anytime between 7:00 am and 8:00 pm.
                                ■■ Pegged orders. A pegged order is a limit order, the price of which is automatically adjusted
                                   to follow the inside market. The price of a pegged buy order would always equal the high-
                                   est bid, whereas the price of a pegged sell order would always equal the lowest offer. A
                                   reverse-pegged order would peg to the opposite side of the market. It would peg at a price
                                   that deviates from the opposite side of the market by .01. Thus, a reverse-pegged buy order
                                   would be priced at .01 less than the inside offer, and a reverse-pegged sell order would be
                                   priced at .01 more than the inside bid.

                                     By entering a regular pegged order, market participants inject liquidity at the best inside
                                price set by other firms. By entering a reverse-pegged order, market participants are providing
                                liquidity at a price as close as possible to the opposite side of the market. As a result, in cases
                                where the inside spread is greater than .01, the entry of a reverse-pegged order would establish
                                a new inside market.
                                     Users may select a cap price beyond which a pegged order will not be executed. Once a
                                price cap is reached, the pegged/reverse-pegged order is converted to a regular limit order at
                                the cap price.
                                     A regular pegged order may not be used to establish the inside bid or offer. Therefore,
                                if all nonpegged displayable interest at the inside is exhausted, the new inside would be the
                                next best price level where nonpegged interest exists, and the price of pegged orders would be
                                adjusted accordingly. If there are no participants on the same side of the market, pegged orders
                                are canceled.
                                ■■ Discretionary orders. An order that, when entered into the system, has both a displayed
                                     bid or offer price, as well as a nondisplayed discretionary price or range at or in which the
                                     participant is also willing to buy or sell, if necessary. The display price must be fixed. A
                                     discretionary order may not result in a quote that locks or crosses the NBBO and may not
                                     be executed at a price that trades through the quote of any ITS exchange unless it also is
                                     designated as a sweep order.

                                ■■ Sweep orders. An order that may be delivered to, or executed by, market participants at
                                   multiple price levels. A trader will split an order into numerous parts comprising the best
                                   prices and amounts available at different levels. It is used by traders who care more about
                                   filling an order quickly (buy or sell) than about price. These orders are sometimes called
                                   sweep-to-fill orders.

                                    To prevent large price movements due to sweep orders, a Nasdaq rule limits the number
                                of price levels against which a single sweep order may execute. The rule limits a single order’s
                                sweep to 10% + .01 away from the current inside market.




                     *
                    EXAMPLE                           The current inside bid for ABCD is $10.00. Firm A enters an unpriced sweep order
                                                 to sell 10,000 shares. There are currently 4,000 shares available to buy between $8.99
                                                 and $10.00, with another 3,000 shares available at $8.98. On the basis of the for-
                                                 mula above, the threshold price will be $8.99 ($10.00 – 10% – .01). Therefore, 4,000
                                                 shares of the order will execute, and the new inside bid will be $8.98. The remaining
                                                 6,000 shares of the order will be returned to the entering party, because there is no
                                                 additional liquidity at or above the threshold bid price.
                                ■■ Intermarket sweep order. Limit orders that the customer requires be executed in a specific
                                   market even if there is a better price found on another market center. This is an exception
                                   to the order protection rule. As previously stated, institutional buy-side investors often
                                   use algorithmic trading schemes that may require an ISO. These orders are not subject to
                                   auto-routing and must be marked with the trade indicator of “F.” The firm sending the ISO
                                   fulfills its regulation NMS order-protection obligations by simultaneously sending orders
                                   to those market centers with better prices.
                                ■■ Summary orders. A limit order that will be returned to the entering party if, upon receipt,
                                   it is marketable. In other words, it is a limit that locks or crosses the market. If the order
                                   was not marked Summary, it would be executed in time priority.
                                ■■ Summary quotes. Market participants can elect to give Nasdaq summary quotes, which
                                   allows these firms to maintain trading interest at multiple price levels. The quotes have to
                                   be designated as Summary at the time of entry.
                                ■■ Auto-ex orders. This type of order executes only against quotes maintained by market
                                   participants that provide automatic execution and that do not charge an access fee.


       4. 8. 7                  LOCKED/CROSSED MARKET DURING NORMAL
                                MARKET HOURS
                                    With Nasdaq Market Center (NMC), locked or crossed markets are eliminated during
                                normal market hours. If a firm attempts to lock the market, the order is routed to the market
                                participant next in line for execution at the locking quote. If a firm attempts to cross the mar-
                                ket, NMC will not display the order. Instead, the order is treated as a marketable limit and
                                entered into the system as a nondirected order for execution in time priority.

                  4. 8. 8           PRICE DEVIATION
                                        Nasdaq has implemented a price validation deviation process for limit orders entered into
                                    NMC. The process will calculate when a limit order price is away from the inside market by a
                                    predetermined amount. In this case, Nasdaq provides the warning message Rej. Over Allowable
                                    Deviation. Override & Resend. If the entering party elects to override, the order is processed.
                                    The following table summarizes the allowable deviations.

                                                         The inside market for ABCD is $12.00–$12.10. The acceptable limit range would

                                                    limit above $12.60 will receive a reject message, which it can choose to override.



                  4. 8. 9           ANTI-INTERNALIZATION QUALIFIER (AIQ)
                                        Many market makers enjoy the benefits of internal order flow from their retail customer
                                    base, executing retail orders against their own quotes. However, a firm can enter an order
                                    with an anti-internalization qualifier (AIQ) modifier, which means the system only executes
                                    against the quotes of other market participants, not against the quotes of the entering party.
                                    Firms may use the AIQ modifier on an order-by-order basis.


                  4. 8. 10 ADF (ALTERNATIVE DISPLAY FACILITY)
                                        As noted earlier, linked ECNs display their Nasdaq quotes in the NMC. Unlinked, or
                                    ineligible, ECNs do not. As a result, FINRA was forced by the SEC to create and operate its
                                    Alternative Display Facility (ADF) to display quotes for these unlinked ECNs. Quotes are
                                    displayed for all Nasdaq equities and for exchange-traded funds, such as QQQs and SPDRs,
                                    on a voluntary basis from 8:00 am—6:30 pm ET. Normal business hours, however, are the cus-
                                    tomary 9:30 am to 4:00 pm ET. The ADF operates with rules very similar to those of Nasdaq,
                                    such as the prohibition (with limited exceptions) of locking and crossing quotations. Another
                                    similarity exists in that an ADF market maker that voluntarily (unexcused) withdraws its
                                    quotations from the ADF and not re-enter within five minutes may not reregister as a market
                                    maker in that security for 20 business days.
                                        To keep it simple, the ADF is the FINRA-operated facility allowing its members to quote
                                    or effect trades in NMS stocks other than on an exchange. The ADF collects and disseminates
                                    quotations and trade reports, and compares trades.
                                        A member firm that wishes to use the ADF must register as a Registered Reporting ADF
                                    Market Maker or a Registered Reporting ADF ECN. These often are referred to as an ADF
                                    Trading Center, or simply Trading Center.

       4. 8. 11 OPENING CROSS
                                    The opening cross rules are designed to create a single opening price similar to the open
                                on an exchange floor. Among other things, these rules replaced the trade or move rules, which
                                dealt with locking/crossing quotes entered before market open.
                                    The orders acceptable for the opening cross are as follows.
                                ■■ Market on open orders (MOO) can be filled only at the opening price.
                                ■■ Limit on open orders (LOO) specify a limit price and can be filled only during the opening
                                    cross at that price or better.
                                ■■ Imbalance only orders (IO) are priced orders designed to offset any imbalance during the
                                    opening cross. They can be executed only against MOO and LOO and early regular hours
                                    orders. These are liquidity-improving orders and will execute only to the extent that there
                                    is offsetting liquidity.

                                    MOO, LOO, and IO orders can be entered, canceled, and adjusted between 7:00 am and
                                9:28 am. After 9:28 am, new MOO and LOO orders cannot be entered, nor can existing MOO
                                and LOO orders be canceled or modified. After 9:28 am, existing IO orders cannot be canceled
                                or modified. However, new IO orders can be entered between 9:28 am and 9:30 am.

                                                      As previously indicated, regular orders entered before 9:28 am are eligible to par-
                                                 ticipate in the opening cross. After 9:28 am, orders that are entered will not partici-

       4. 8. 12 THE CROSS PROCESS
                                    Nasdaq Market Center (NMC) Execution System quotes go live at 9:25 am and are shown
                                in time priority. To prevent locked or crossed markets, all such quotes are held in a separate
                                queue. Before the opening cross, these in queue orders are executed against the best bid or best
                                offer.

                                             Starting at 9:28 am until market open, Nasdaq displays an order imbalance (IO) indica-
                                        tor, which is updated every five seconds. The indicator displays the current match price; the
                                        number of shares priced at the match price on the basis of accumulated MOO, LOO, IO, and
                                        early regular orders entered; and the size of the imbalance. This is done to attract more buyers
                                        if there are too many sellers and vice versa.
                                             On the basis of the accumulated orders on the buy-and-sell sides of the market, an open-
                                        ing price is set to maximize the number of orders filled. This is termed the clearing price. These
                                        orders are cleared in one sweep at 9:30 am—the opening cross and creates the Nasdaq Official
                                        Opening Price (NOOP). At this point, regular trading begins. Orders executed prior to the
                                        opening cross must be reported with a “.T” modifier designating that the execution did not
                                        occur during normal market hours.


                  4. 8. 13 CLOSING CROSS (NASDAQ)
                                            The closing cross rules are designed to create a single closing price. On the close orders
                                        (OC) can be market (MOC) or limit (LOC). They can be accepted from 7:00 am until 3:50
                                        pm. After that time, Nasdaq stops accepting entry, cancellation, or modification of OC orders.
                                            To offset an imbalance between the bid and offer sides of the market, Nasdaq accepts
                                        imbalance only orders (IO) until market close. IO orders must be priced. After 3:50 pm, exist-
                                        ing IO orders cannot be canceled or modified, although new IO orders can be entered.
                                            Beginning at 3:50 pm, Nasdaq publishes an order imbalance indicator that is updated
                                        every five seconds until market close. The indicator provides information on:
                                        ■■ the current reference price, which is the price at which paired shares are maximized and
                                            the imbalance is minimized;
                                        ■■ the number of paired shares at the reference price; and
                                        ■■ the number of shares that would remain unexecuted at the current reference price and the
                                            side of the imbalance (buy or sell).

                    4. 9             WEBLINK ACT

                                            Weblink ACT facilitates trade reporting and clearing using a web-based system that compares
                                        trade information reported to the FINRA/Nasdaq TRF by locking-in trades to the National
                                        Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC). All trades thus reported are deemed locked in and
                                        are considered firm obligations and must be honored on the scheduled settlement date.
                                            Clearing firms can use Nasdaq Weblink ACT to manage their risk by placing limitations
                                        on correspondent buying and selling as well as blockbuster limits.

                                    As noted earlier, Nasdaq became a registered stock exchange in late 2006. One of the
                                requirements to be considered an exchange was to separate its trade execution services from its
                                trade reporting facility. To do this, FINRA Trade created the trade reporting facility (FINRA/
                                Nasdaq TRF) to report NMS stocks executed otherwise than on an exchange. Technically, the
                                Nasdaq/TRF reports trades for Nasdaq stocks and exchange-listed stocks traded in the third
                                market, whereas the OTC Reporting Facility (ORF) reports OTC Pink stocks.



       4. 9. 1                  SECURITIES REPORTED
                                    Trade reports all OTC interdealer domestic and foreign equity transactions. Convertible
                                bonds listed on Nasdaq, non-Nasdaq securities, and “out of system” transactions, also are
                                reported through a FINRA facility such as a TRF or the ORF.


       4. 9. 2                  REPORTING PARTICIPANTS
                                    Reporting participants defined by FINRA include the following.


             4. 9. 2. 1             Market Makers
                                    Included are Nasdaq market makers that are self-clearing firms (i.e., members of a regis-
                                tered clearing agency) or have a clearing arrangement with a clearing broker.


             4. 9. 2. 2             Order Entry Firms
                                    These member firms execute orders on behalf of other member firms in stocks in which
                                they are not market makers; many order entry firms are self-clearing.


             4. 9. 2. 3             Clearing Brokers
                                     Clearing brokers are member firms that have been identified as principals for clearing and
                                settling a trade, whether for their own accounts or for a correspondent firm.


             4. 9. 2. 4             Correspondent Executing Brokers
                                    These are member firms that execute their own trades but clear them through a clearing
                                member firm, as previously identified; these firms use give up clearing arrangements, because
                                the clearing broker is given up to the market maker that executes the trade. The clearing broker
                                takes custody of securities purchased by a correspondent executing broker. A clearing mem-
                                ber firm is obligated to accept and clear each trade that the system identifies as having been
                                effected by the firm itself or by any correspondent executing broker.

                  4. 9. 3       TRANSACTION REPORTING BY TRF PARTICIPANTS
                                (FINRA RULE 6380A)
                                    Market makers and order entry firms are the two types of participants that input trade
                                reports into the Trade Reporting Facility (TRF). Reports must be made as soon as possible but
                                no later than 10 seconds of trade execution. Transactions not reported within 10 seconds after
                                execution must be designated as late.
                                    Whether firms subscribe to Weblink ACT or some other system to facilitate trade report-
                                ing to FINRA/Nasdaq TRF, OTC trades must comply with the 10-second reporting rule.
                                    As a cautionary note, do not delay a trade report until the last second. A pattern of late
                                reporting may trigger a violation of FINRA Rule 2010 (i.e., behavior inconsistent with high
                                standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade).


                  4. 9. 4       REPORTING RESPONSIBILITIES
                                    In general, only one side, the executing party, reports the trade. The specific reporting
                                responsibilities are summarized as follows.

                                           Transaction Between                                          Who Reports
                                           Two executing brokers (manually negotiated)                  Sell side only

                                                  In interdealer trades, the only time the buy side reports is when the buyer is a

                                    Self-clearing market makers must accept and clear each trade identified as belonging to
                                that market maker. Nonclearing market makers must notify the TRF of the clearing arrange-
                                ment and guarantee acceptance of their trades by the clearing broker. Promptly notify the TRF
                                of any change.
                                    If market makers inadvertently fail to maintain a clearing agreement at any time, they are
                                removed from a FINRA facility and cannot act as a market maker until an alternate clearing
                                arrangement is in place.

                                                    For market makers, voluntary failure to maintain a clearing agreement is treated
                                               like a voluntary termination. They must wait 20 business days before attempting to
                                               reregister. If failure to maintain a clearing agreement is involuntary, the firm may reen-
                                               ter once a new clearing agreement is in place.

                                    Clearing brokers must accept their own trades and those on behalf of their correspondents.
                                Clearing brokers may terminate clearing arrangements with correspondents at any time by
                                supplying notice. After notice is acknowledged by a FINRA trade reporting facility, the clear-
                                ing broker’s responsibilities to the correspondent are ended as soon as the facility takes steps to
                                remove the clearing broker from the system for that correspondent firm.

                                       Principal Trades. In a principal trade, a market maker either buys from a customer less a
                                    markdown or sells to a customer with a markup. In other words, the market maker is either
                                    buying for inventory or selling from inventory.

       4. 9. 8                  TRADE REPORTING RULES
                                    FINRA provides a number of methods to report transactions in OTC equity securities. For
                                transactions taking place while FINRA facilities are open, a member must report trades within
                                10 of execution. Reports also must be made for trades made outside normal market hours.
                                Normal market hours are from 9:30 am to 4:00 pm ET. FINRA requires that trades taking
                                place in NMS stocks outside those hours be reported to an authorized reporting facility, such
                                as the ADF (Alternative Display Facility, operated by FINRA) which is open from 8:00 am to
                                6:30 pm, or TRFs or the ORF, which are open from 8:00 am to 8:00 pm.
                                    Reports made of after-hours trades do so with a modifier of “.T.” If a trade was executed
                                between midnight and 8:00 am, the trade must be reported on trade date no later than 8:15
                                am. If a trade was executed between the close of a FINRA facility and midnight, the trade
                                must be reported on an “as/of” basis the following business day (T+1) by 8:15 am. If either
                                category of trades is reported after 8:15 am, the trade must be reported with a late, outside-
                                normal-market-hours trade report modifier of “.U.”
                                    The FINRA/Nasdaq TRF and ORF permit firms to submit outside normal market hours
                                trade reports to the two facilities throughout the day. The other two TRFs—the ADF and
                                FINRA/NYSE TRF—also permit these reports to be submitted during normal market hours.

                      TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                     Some testable points about reporting modifiers are as follows.
                                                     ■■ .T is used when trades are effected outside of market hours but reported on
                                                        the same day.

                                                     ■■ As-of is used when trades are effected outside of market hours but reported
                                                        the next day.

                                                     ■■ A no-was trade is a correction report. No represents the canceled portion;
                                                        Was represents the correction. No-was reports must be made by 8:00 pm on
                                                        the day of the trade.


                                    After-hours trading permits market participants to react to late breaking news. However,
                                one of problems with after-hours trading is that volume is low, and that often means high
                                volatility. Stocks may make large movements in reaction to after-the-bell news. Spreads are
                                wider as well due to much lighter volume. Protection, like trailing stops, that is available
                                during normal hours is not available in the after market. These factors contribute to making
                                after-hours trading a challenge.


                  4. 9. 9       LATE REPORTS (“AS/OF” AND T+N)
                                    If a trade is not reported on time, it must be reported as soon as possible and must be desig-
                                nated as late. Trades that are not reported on trade date for whatever reason must be reported
                                on an “as/of” basis on a subsequent date (T+N) and be designated as late. Furthermore, trades,
                                such as those executed outside normal market hours, are to be reported on an as/of basis,

                                typically the next business day (T+1). However, if that doesn’t happen and the trade is not
                                reported on T+1, it must be reported on a subsequent date (T+N) and be designated as late.


       4. 9. 10 TRADE REPORTING
                                    The following report modifiers describe special trading circumstances.


       4. 9. 11 COMMON MODIFIERS
                                    .C (cash trade) is used for a cash (same day) settlement.

                                    .N (next day) is used for a next-day settlement.

                                   .O (price override) is used when a transaction to be entered is within 10 seconds and the
                                market has moved away from the reported trade price.

                                   .Z (late trade report) designates a transaction reported more than 10 seconds after
                                execution.

                                    .SNN (extended settlement trade) For this modifier, add .S and the number of settle-
                                ment days between four and 60 to indicate the appropriate number of business days in which
                                the trade will settle (e.g., .S08 for eight days).

                                    .P (late execution prior reference price) designates a transaction that was reported on
                                time but relates to a trade that arose at an earlier time during the day. The time on the trade
                                report should be the time the obligation to trade arose, and the price should be the price at the
                                time the order should have been executed. Some systems may still use .PRP.

                                    .W (stop stock transaction) is used to modify two different trade reports. First, a stop
                                stock trade, which is a transaction resulting from an order in which a member and another
                                party agree that the order will be executed at the stop stock price or better. The trade report
                                will include the time at which the parties agreed to the stop stock price, not the actual time
                                the trade was executed. The modifier is not appended to the report of a stop stock trade if the
                                trade is executed and reported within 10 seconds of the time the member and the other party
                                agree to the stop stock price. A DMM may not stop stock against the book or for his own
                                account.

                                    .W (weighted average price/special pricing formula) The .W modifier also is used as
                                a modifier by firms for trade pricing based on average weighting or another special pricing
                                formula for Nasdaq. Combinations of modifiers are expected. A member can report that a
                                transaction is both a weighted average price (.W) and outside market hours (.T) transaction.

                                                      A stop stock transaction is not the same as a stop order.
                                                      A stop stock transaction is an order in which a member and another party agree
                                                 that the order will be executed at a stop stock price or better, and then executed at
                                                 the stop stock price or better.

                                               As we saw earlier in Unit 4, a stop stock transaction may be flagged with the
                                           trade modifier as trade-through exempt, if it qualifies as such under SEC Rule 611 of
                                           Regulation NMS.
                                                 By comparison, a stop order is a market or limit order that does not become ef-
                                           fective until a certain market price is reached and is executed. Stop order transactions
                                           are not reported with a special trade report modifier.

                                    A step-out allows an executing broker to step out (or allocate) all or a portion of a trade to
                                other brokers. In other words, a step-out indicator functions as a position transfer rather than
                                a trade. For every step-out, one firm is stepping out of (or transferring) the position, and the
                                other firm is stepping into (or receiving) the position. Member firms may effect a “step-out” by
                                submitting a clearing-only report to a FINRA facility, such as ORF.

                                    The ADF, FINRA/Nasdaq, TRF, and the ORF provide trade acceptance and comparison
                                functionality. This means that the reporting party submits the trade information, and the con-
                                tra party then accepts or declines the trade information submitted.

                                            The cancellation of any trade previously submitted must be made by the party responsible
                                        for submitting the original trade report. For trades executed through a Nasdaq system that
                                        reports to Nasdaq TRF, the party that would have been responsible for reporting the trade, had
                                        the system not been in place, must make the cancellation report. The time frame for reporting
                                        canceled trades is as follows.
                                        ■■ For trades executed during normal hours and canceled at or before 4:00, the cancellation
                                            report must be made within 10 seconds of the time the trade is canceled.
                                        ■■ For trades executed during normal hours and canceled after 4:00 but before 8:00 pm, the
                                            member responsible must use its best efforts to report the cancellation not later than 8:00.
                                            If the member is unable to do so, it must report the cancellation by 8:00 pm on the follow-
                                            ing business day.
                                        ■■ For trades executed during normal hours and canceled after 8:00 pm, the cancellation
                                            report must be made by 8:00 pm on the following business day.
                                        ■■ For trades executed outside of normal hours and canceled before 8:00 pm on the date of
                                            execution, the cancellation report must be made that day by 8:00 pm.

                                             There is a great deal of risk in trading that goes well beyond market risk. In today’s markets
                                        where those with direct market access can effect high frequency, algorithmic trades, the need
                                        for an automated control system to head off fat finger or miscalculated algo errors, pre-trade
                                        risk management is a valuable tool.

             4. 9. 14. 1 Single Trade Limit
                                    A single trade limit is a pre-established dollar amount established by Nasdaq for a single
                                trade, above which the Nasdaq Risk Management system enables a clearing firm to review the
                                trade before it is obligated to clear the trade. Rules allow a review period of 15 minutes before
                                the clearing broker must accept or decline the trade. If the clearing firm does not affirma-
                                tively accept or decline the trade, the Nasdaq Risk Management Service will instruct appro-
                                priate TRF that the trades should be either automatically declined or automatically subjected
                                to normal processing in which the clearing broker will act as principal to clear the trades.
                                Transactions exceeding this limit are sometimes called blockbuster trades. The 15-minute
                                period allows the member time to assess risk of the trade.


             4. 9. 14. 2 Gross Dollar Thresholds
                                    Clearing brokers may establish a maximum gross dollar limit for their correspondents,
                                which is a daily dollar amount of purchases and sales for each correspondent. If exceeded, the
                                clearing broker is alerted. These limits may be raised and lowered during the trading day or
                                from one day to the next. An early warning alarm, called the pre-alert, informs the clearing
                                broker-dealer when the correspondent has reached 70% of the gross dollar threshold.


             4. 9. 14. 3 SuperCap Limit
                                    Super Caps means the daily dollar amounts for purchases and sales that a clearing firm
                                establishes in the Nasdaq Risk Management system for each correspondent executing broker.
                                That amount may be raised or lowered on an inter-day or intra-day basis.
                                    If a correspondent’s gross dollar threshold (Super Cap) is exceeded, the clearing broker
                                and TRF will be notified. Nasdaq Risk Management will automatically instruct TRF that any
                                trade in excess of an applicable “sizeable limit” that was set by the correspondent firm is subject
                                to review by the clearing firm until the correspondent’s trading activity no longer exceeds a
                                gross dollar threshold. The clearing firm has 15 minutes from execution to review any single
                                trade negotiated by its correspondent that equals or exceeds the limit in order to decide to act
                                as principal for the trade or to decline to act as principal. If the clearing broker does not affir-
                                matively accept or decline the sizeable trade at the end of 15 minutes, the system will instruct
                                TRF to act in accordance with pre-established instructions; that is, accept or decline the trade.

                                4. 9. 14. 3. 1 Reporting Transactions Summary
                                   The following is required when reporting transactions information:
                                ■■ Stock symbol (FINRA will not issue a symbol for an equity security unless it has a CUSIP

                                    reported only once.

                                                    simultaneously buys for a customer as agent 100 shares at 60 plus a $50 commission.
                                                    The report is 100 shares at 60.

                                        For principal crosses, where a market maker buys and sells as principal, the transaction is
                                    reported only once.


                  4. 9. 17 OTC EQUITY REPORTING (FINRA RULE 6400)
                                        Rule 6400 deals with the quoting and trading requirements of OTC equity securities.

                                         ORF. The OTC Reporting Facility (ORF) is a service provided by FINRA that accom-
                                    modates reporting trades in OTC Equity Securities executed other than on an exchange and
                                    for trades in restricted equity securities effected under Rule 144A.
                                         With respect to those OTC Equity Securities and Restricted Equity Securities that are not
                                    eligible for clearance and settlement through the NSCC, the ORF comparison function is not
                                    available. However, this does support the entry and dissemination of last sale data on those
                                    securities.

             4. 9. 17. 1 TRACE—Rule 6700
                                    TRACE is FINRA’s trade reporting system for OTC primary and secondary market trans-
                                actions in TRACE-eligible fixed income securities, such as corporate, agency, government-
                                sponsored enterprises (GSE), and asset-backed securities, including those effected pursuant
                                to Rule 144A. This mandatory reporting by market participants is facilitated through the
                                Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine (TRACE). The current TRACE reporting time is
                                15 minutes for transactions in eligible securities from 8:00 am to 6:29.59 pm ET on each busi-
                                ness day. FINRA then immediately disseminates trade information to the investing public to
                                promote market transparency. Transactions executed on a business day less than 15 minutes
                                before 6:30:00 p.m. ET must be reported no later than 15 minutes after the TRACE system
                                opens the next business day (T + 1), and if reported on T + 1, designated “as/of” and include
                                the date of execution.
                                    Member firms are identified by an MPID. MPID is an abbreviation for Market Participant
                                Identification and must use that identifier for trade reporting and for an audit trail. Obtain an

                                    Dollar denominated corporate debt securities issued by a U.S. or foreign private issuer,
                                including church bonds, agency debt securities, and mortgage and asset-backed securities, fall
                                within the definition of a TRACE-eligible security. FINRA makes available a file each day at
                                7:00 am ET of all TRACE-eligible securities, and it’s updated throughout the day until 8:00
                                pm. Specifically excluded from TRACE reporting are:
                                ■■ U.S. Treasury securities (T-bonds, T-notes etc.);
                                ■■ debt of foreign sovereign government;
                                ■■ money-market instruments (debt at issuance with a maturity of one calendar year or less);
                                ■■ debt securities that are not DTC eligible or are in physical form.



           TEST TOPIC ALERT
                            !                         Municipal securities are not TRACE-eligible securities. Municipal securities trans-
                                                 actions are reported by MSRB’s EMMA system.

                                    TRACE is not an execution system; it is a trade reporting system only. It does not accept
                                quotations, nor does it provide settlement and clearance functions. Facts about TRACE
                                reporting to consider include the following.
                                ■■ Both sides to an interdealer trade must report (dual side reporting).
                                ■■ Trades must be reported within 15 minutes of execution. Otherwise, the transaction report
                                    will be late.
                                ■■ Primary market trades that execute at a fixed offering price are reportable with T+1. Those
                                    primary market trades other than asset-backed securities that execute at market prices are
                                    reportable within the normal 15-minute window required of secondary market trades.

                                   TRACE displays:

                                        ■■ whether the trade was reported late; and
                                        ■■ whether the price reflects that a commission was charged;

                                             For example, if the executing broker were long bonds, it would report that it sold as princi-
                                        pal net to the introducing broker. If the introducing broker charged its customer a commission,
                                        the introducing broker must report the commission in the separate “commission” field through
                                        the TRAQS Web browser interface.
                                             In another example, if the firm received an unsolicited order from a customer to purchase
                                        TRACE-Eligible Securities at the market and the firm had no position requiring it to go to
                                        the street to buy bonds in pieces through its omnibus account, when the order is filled and an
                                        agency commission is charged, this is how it’s reported:
                                             Report an agency buy from each firm that sold the firm TRACE-Eligible-Securities. The
                                        firm then reports an agency sell with “C” (for the end customer), and the amount of the com-
                                        mission charged in the commission box.
                                             Once FINRA receives trade information on TRACE-eligible debt securities, as previously
                                        stated, it immediately disseminates this information to the public.
                                             Although all broker-dealers have an obligation to report transactions in OTC Corporate
                                        Bonds and Agency Debt to TRACE, the actual technical platform is known as FINRA Trade
                                        Reporting and Quotation Service (TRAQS). TRAQS is a central communication source and
                                        is the primary collector, disseminator, and support service that is used by members for the
                                        posting of quotes and reporting of trades to FINRA for not only TRACE-eligible securities
                                        but transactions in OTC Equity Securities (non-NMS stocks), DPPs, and Restricted Equity
                                        Securities to the ORF TRAQS website. ORF stands for OTC Reporting Facility.
                                             If a member fails to abide by the rules of the TRACE service or fails to promptly pay for
                                        the service, FINRA may, upon notice, terminate service to the member.

                                        4. 9. 17. 1. 1 Give-up
                                             A correspondent broker-dealer, which plans to trade and report through its clearing firm,
                                        must sign a TRACE Participant Agreement.
                                             As previously mentioned, if an introducing member firm takes an order, it has an obliga-
                                        tion to report the executed transaction to TRACE. It also must report its activity with the end
                                        customer and with the clearing firm.
                                             The clearing broker-dealer and the introducing firm must submit two signed TRACE
                                        Participation Agreements. Under a “give-up” agreement, the introducing firm, which does
                                        not have access to TRACE, may directly fulfill the requirement to report both the buy trade
                                        and sell trade by authorizing (giving up) the clearing firm to submit both TRACE reports on
                                        its behalf.

                                                        must be reported within 15 minutes of system opening on the following business day.

                                    The Nasdaq International Service allows market makers to publish quotes and execute
                                trades outside the United States in:
                                ■■ Global Market securities;
                                ■■ any non-Canadian foreign security or ADR that is part of Nasdaq but not a Global Market
                                    security; and
                                ■■ any equity security listed on a national securities exchange.

                                                      Nasdaq Capital Market securities are not part of Nasdaq International except for
                                                 foreign securities and ADRs.

                                     Market makers can register as European Only market makers, which means they can
                                quote the stock from 3:30 am to 9:00 am ET (the European session). Market makers can also
                                register as International Service market makers, which means their market is good not only
                                for the European session, but for the domestic session as well.
                                     Firms must be registered with FINRA as European Only or International Service market
                                makers. At the time of registration, firms must select, on a security-by-security basis, one of the
                                following periods to define their market making commitment:
                                                                         3:30 am to 9:00 am

                                   To participate in Nasdaq International, firms must be members or approved affiliates. An
                                approved affiliate is a broker-dealer that is:
                                ■■ not a FINRA member;
                                ■■ authorized to conduct business in the UK in accordance with the Financial Services Act
                                   of 1986; and
                                ■■ controlled by, controls, or is under common control with a member.

                                                      Approved affiliates are limited to European-only registration.

                                    Clearance and settlement of European session trades must be effected through a regis-
                                tered clearing agency that uses a continuous net settlement system (CNS). Last sale reports
                                in the European session must be made to FINRA within three minutes of execution. Like
                                their domestic counterparts, European session market makers make daily and monthly volume
                                reports to FINRA. For trades executed outside of normal European hours, market makers must
                                make weekly reports.
                                    Other International Service rules are similar to those of Nasdaq.
                                ■■ Excused withdrawals are permitted.
                                ■■ Voluntary termination is accomplished by quote withdrawal. If a market maker withdraws
                                    its quotes from the European session, it may continue to act as a market maker in the
                                    domestic session if it is registered as an International Service market maker.
                                ■■ Quotes must be firm for the size displayed.

                                      The syndicate manager must notify Nasdaq by 6:45 pm on the night before the issue is
                                 released for trading as to what the public offering price (POP) will be. The POP will be the
                                 first bid during the 15-minute quotation period. Market makers must quote the issue for 15
                                 minutes before any trades can be executed. Any trades executed during this period represent
                                 a violation of FINRA rules.



                  4. 12         NASDAQ MARKETWATCH

                                      To maintain a fair and orderly marketplace for investors and listed companies, Nasdaq
                                 MarketWatch, working closely with FINRA, uses automated, real-time surveillance systems
                                 to scan for irregular trading activity on the Nasdaq stock market. When trading activity is sus-
                                 pected of being in violation of exchange rules and policies, MarketWatch refers the activity to
                                 FINRA’s Department of Market Regulation for further review and possible disciplinary action.
                                 MarketWatch also may contact a listed company for its view on why unusual market activity
                                 is occurring, reviews news notifications that may affect listed companies, and exerts its best
                                 effort to judge the materiality of an announcement.
                                      MarketWatch also oversees the disclosure of important information by Nasdaq-listed com-
                                 panies as well as monitoring their compliance with exchange rules. Nasdaq requires that its
                                 listed companies make timely disclosure to the public through any Regulation FD-compliant
                                 method of information that would likely affect the value of its securities or influence the deci-
                                 sions of market participants.
                                      Nasdaq-listed companies must notify MarketWatch at least 10 minutes prior to the release
                                 of important news to the general public during Nasdaq/MarketWatch market hours (4:00 am
                                 to 8:00 pm ET). Notification by listed companies must be provided to MarketWatch through
                                 the Electronic Disclosure submission system. MarketWatch generally implements trading

                                      Between the hours of 4:00 am and 7:00 am ET, temporary trading halts also may be admin-
                                 istered at the request of a NASDAQ-listed company in anticipation of the release of material
                                 news, or if trading in the stock is halted in a foreign market. When appropriate, MarketWatch
                                 may implement temporary halts prior to the public dissemination of material news. A tempo-
                                 rary trading halt is a good thing. It allows material news to be widely disseminated so existing
                                 and potential shareholders know that all trading is based on publicly held facts. Although the
                                 length of the halt can vary, trading normally restarts about 30 minutes after the press release
                                 or some Regulation FD-compliant method. Much depends on communication with the listed
                                 company.

                                                      Nasdaq-listed companies have an obligation to notify MarketWatch at least 10
                                                 minutes prior to the release of material news when the public release of the informa-

                                                 information is made outside those times, they are required to alert MarketWatch prior
                                                 to 6:50 am ET. The consideration of temporary trading halts occurs during regular
                                                 market hours as well as during pre-market and after-hours trading sessions.

                  4. 13         UNIFORM PRACTICE
                                     The Uniform Practice Code (UPC) of FINRA was created to set rules for dealer-to-
                                 dealer transactions in the over-the-counter market. The Code only applies to transactions in
                                 nonexempt securities.


                  4. 13. 1 EXCLUSIONS
                                    The Code does not apply to transactions:
                                 ■■ executed on an exchange floor;
                                 ■■ in exempt securities;
                                 ■■ in redeemable investment company securities, such as mutual funds (publicly traded funds
                                    are subject to the Code); and
                                 ■■ settled outside the united states.

                                     The authority to issue interpretations and rulings and to administer the Code rests with
                                 the Uniform Practice Committee of FINRA.


                  4. 13. 2 SETTLEMENT DATES
                                      Regular way settlement for most securities is the third business day following trade date.
                                 It is the date on which a buyer is expected to pay for securities purchased and a seller to make
                                 delivery on securities sold.
                                      Cash settlement transactions require delivery of securities from sellers and payment from
                                 buyers on the same day the trade is executed (same-day settlement). UPC rules require that
                                 cash settlement transactions be finalized on or before 2:30 pm ET.
                                      Seller’s option is a type of settlement that can occur if the seller, for good reason, will be
                                 unable to deliver the securities to the buyer by the regular way settlement date. If granted by
                                 the buying dealer, the seller can make delivery on or before the date the option expires.
                                      Under UPC rules, the earliest the seller can make delivery is the fourth business day fol-
                                 lowing the trade date. (If the seller were able to deliver any earlier, the option would not be
                                 required.) Before making delivery to the purchaser, the seller must give the buyer a written
                                 notice of intention to deliver. This notice must be given at least one business day prior to
                                 making delivery.

                                                     As a general rule, all physical deliveries must be made by the seller at the office of

                                                     By way of comparison, NYSE rules vary somewhat in that delivery on a seller’s
                                                 option contract can be made as early as two business days from trade date and as late
                                                 as 60 business days from trade date.


             4. 13. 2. 1 Syndicate Settlement
                                     The final settlement of syndicate accounts must be effected by the manager within 90 days
                                following the syndicate settlement date, which is the date on which the securities are deliv-
                                ered by the issuer to or for the account of the syndicate members.

             4. 13. 2. 2 Clearance and Money Settlement
                                     As noted in an earlier Unit, interdealer trades are reported and submitted to National
                                Securities Clearing Corp. (NSCC) for clearance and settlement. NSCC works on a continu-
                                ous net settlement (CNS) basis (interdealer buys and sells, per security, are netted each day
                                for delivery and money settlement purposes).
                                     Delivery for many securities is accomplished through bookkeeping entries at a securities
                                depository, such as the Depository Trust Company (DTC). DTC provides securities certificate
                                safekeeping for member firms, and changes in ownership are made by computerized entries
                                rather than physical delivery.
                                     Depository Trust & Clearing Corp. (DTCC) was formed with the acquisition of NSCC by
                                DTC. To clear transactions, firms must be members of NSCC or clearing corporations associ-
                                ated with an exchange, such as Midwest Clearing Corp. DTC itself is involved in custody and
                                safekeeping, not in clearance. DTC also processes dividend and interest payments on securi-
                                ties it holds in safekeeping.


       4. 13. 3 EX-CLEARING TRADES
                                    As the majority of interdealer trades are confirmed and settled electronically, the need for
                                paper confirmations has diminished. Nonetheless, there are trades, such as when-issued con-
                                tracts, that are settled outside the scope of automated confirmation and transaction reporting
                                systems and NSCC. The rules for these ex-clearing trades are as follows.
                                ■■ Interdealer paper confirmations must be sent no later than T+1.
                                ■■ When one party to a trade (the confirming member) sends a confirmation but does not
                                    receive one in return, the confirming member must send a don’t know (DK) notice to the
                                    nonconfirming member after four business days from trade date.
                                ■■ After receipt of the DK notice, the nonconfirming member has four business days to either
                                    confirm or DK the trade.
                                ■■ If no response is received from the nonconfirming member, the confirming member can
                                    consider the nonresponse as a DK and can drop the trade or pursue remedies under the
                                    Code of Arbitration.

                  4. 13. 4 WHEN-ISSUED CONTRACTS
                                            A when-issued (WI) contract is a written agreement between members to buy or sell a
                                        security prior to its issuance. These trades are settled ex-clearing, so paper confirmations are
                                        required. Each WI contract must contain:
                                        ■■ a description of the security and the plan, if any, under which the security is to be issued;
                                        ■■ the designation of FINRA as the authority to rule on the contract; and
                                        ■■ procedures for marking the contract to the market.

                                            The buying member treats a WI contract as a margin purchase by putting up 50%. If the
                                        price of the contract declines in the when-issued trading market, the seller (the unsecured
                                        party) may demand additional collateral. This is called marking to the market and repre-
                                        sents the difference between the contract price and the market price. Under Uniform Practice
                                        Rules, mark to the market requests must be met promptly.
                                            On the other hand, if the price in the when-issued trading market rises, the buyer can
                                        demand a refund of the up-front money equal to the difference between the contract price and
                                        the market price. Failure to comply with a demand for additional collateral or a demand for
                                        a refund entitles the buyer (in the event of a refund demand) or the seller (in the event of a
                                        demand for additional collateral) to close the contract without notice (by making an offsetting
                                        purchase or sale).
                                            Funds received by the selling member (50%), as well as any additional funds received as
                                        the result of mark to the market requests, must be segregated by that member on its books and
                                        records.
                                            Settlement of when-issued contracts is determined by the Uniform Practice Committee
                                        after a sufficient percentage of the issue is outstanding.

                                                        made by the seller (e.g., syndicate) on the business day following written notice of

                  4. 13. 5 STOCK BORROWED
                                            When a member, for whatever reason, borrows stock from another member or securities
                                        lending firm, the following rules apply.
                                        ■■ The borrowing member must put up, in cash, an amount equal to the market value of the
                                            borrowed stock.
                                        ■■ The borrowed stock is marked to the market daily, which may require the borrower to put
                                            up more cash or receive a partial refund.
                                        ■■ The lender is entitled to any dividends on the loaned stock.
                                        ■■ The stock is returnable upon demand of the lender.

                                            On the flip side, securities lending may not be appropriate for all investors. For example,
                                        proxy voting rights on loaned securities are forfeited, and loaned shares are not protected by
                                        SIPC. However, subject to its limits, the cash collateral received for the loaned securities is
                                        protected by SIPC.

       4. 13. 6 CLEARLY ERRONEOUS TRADES
                                    Nasdaq has the authority to declare any interdealer trade null and void or adjust the terms
                                of any interdealer trade if the terms of the trade are clearly in error (e.g., obvious error in price,
                                number of shares). Nasdaq can take these actions on its own or in response to a complaint
                                from a member.
                                    If a member wants to have a trade nullified or adjusted, it must notify Nasdaq Market
                                Operations within 30 minutes of the execution and provide all the details surrounding the trade.
                                After review, Nasdaq will make a decision to:
                                ■■ void the trade;
                                ■■ adjust the terms of the trade; or
                                ■■ take no action.

                                    Either side to the trade can appeal Nasdaq’s decision. Any appeal must be made to the
                                Market Operation Review Committee (MORC) within one-half hour of receiving Nasdaq’s
                                decision. All decisions made by the Committee are final and binding.
                                    In the case of an outlier transaction, Nasdaq officials may consider requests after 30 min-
                                utes but no longer than 60 minutes after the transaction in question.
                                    An outlier transaction is when the execution price of the security is greater than three
                                times the current numerical guidelines.

                                                      Initial notification is made to Nasdaq Market Operations. Appeals of their deci-
                                                 sion must be made to the Market Operations Review Committee.

                                                      Obvious errors can be avoided by fat-finger checks that allow a comparison of
                                                 price instructions on incoming orders against the current displayed size and price in
                                                 the market. If the order is outside a preset threshold with the displayed price and size,
                                                 the order will be rejected before it can be executed.
                                                     Firms can set order limits at several levels to ensure that fat-fingered orders never
                                                 execute.
                                                      The so-called flash crash of May 6, 2010, is thought to have been caused by a
                                                 fat-finger error. Some traders may set a fat-finger check for any trade size that they
                                                 know to be larger than what they customarily place.




       4. 14            GOOD DELIVERY RULES
                                    Before a security that has been sold can be delivered to the buyer, it must be in good deliv-
                                erable form. Good delivery describes the physical condition, signatures, attachments, and
                                denominations of the certificates involved in a securities transaction. Although good delivery
                                is mostly a matter of street-side settlements between buying and selling dealers, it also applies
                                to deliveries from customers on sell orders.

                                                                                        Unit 4   Supervision of Trading and Market Making       307



                                        In any dealer-to-dealer transaction, the delivered securities must be accompanied by a
                                    properly executed uniform delivery ticket. The transfer agent is the final arbiter of whether a
                                    security meets good delivery.


                  4. 14. 1 UNIT DELIVERY RULE
                                        For round-lot sales of common stock, delivery must be made in denominations that add up
                                    to 100 shares or are divisible by 100 shares.




                                *
                                EXAMPLE                 For a 300-share sale, the seller could deliver:
                                                        ■■ one 300-share certificate;

                                                        ■■ three 100-share certificates;

                                                        ■■ six 50-share certificates;

                                                        ■■ two 100-share certificates, one 60-share certificate, and one 40-share
                                                           certificate; or

                                                        ■■ three 60-share certificates and three 40-share certificates.

                                                        Each of these deliveries meets the requirements of the rule. However, delivering
                                                    four 75-share certificates would not be good delivery. Can you take the certificates
                                                    and make stacks of 100 shares? If the answer is yes, it is good delivery.


                        4. 14. 1. 1 Partial Deliveries
                                        A partial delivery is acceptable under Uniform Practice Rules if the amount remaining to
                                    be delivered does not include an odd lot.




                                *
                                EXAMPLE




                  4. 14. 2 BOND DELIVERIES
                                                         Delivering 200 shares to satisfy a 300-share sale would be good delivery (the
                                                    amount remaining is a round lot). However, delivering 250 shares in the same sce-
                                                    nario would not be good delivery, because the remainder would be an odd lot.




                                         Each delivery of bearer bonds must be in denominations of $1,000 or $5,000. Any other
                                    denomination is a counterfeit. For registered bonds, delivery must be in denominations of
                                    $1,000 or multiples thereof ($5,000, $10,000, $25,000, et cetera) but in no event in a denomi-
                                    nation larger than $100,000.
                                         If a bond issue has become the subject of a partial call, delivering certificates subject to
                                    the call is not good delivery (unless identified at time of trade as being called bonds). Rather,
                                    it is presumed that the buyer wants to buy bonds not subject to the call. However, if the issue
                                    is subject to an in-whole call, delivery of any certificate is good delivery. The only bonds the
                                    seller can deliver are ones subject to the call.

       4. 14. 3 COMPUTATION OF ACCRUED INTEREST
                                     The majority of bonds trade and interest, which means that the buyer pays the seller the
                                market price of the bond plus any interest accrued since the previous interest payment date.
                                Because the buyer will receive the full amount of the next interest payment (including inter-
                                est that accrued while the seller still owned the bond), the seller must be reimbursed for that
                                portion of the interest.
                                     Most bonds pay interest every six months on either the 1st or the 15th of specified months.
                                The payment dates are known as coupon dates.

                                    Accrued interest affects bond transactions when settlement occurs between coupon dates.




                     *
                    EXAMPLE                           If a J&J bond trades in March, the buyer will collect six months of interest in July
                                                 from the issuer even though the buyer owned the bond for only three months of that
                                                 period.

                                     The buyer and seller settle this by adding the accrued interest to the cost of the buy trans-
                                action (as well as to the sales proceeds). Therefore, the buyer pays the accrued interest to the
                                seller and receives the full interest payment on the next coupon date. The net amount is what
                                has been earned by the buyer for that six-month period.
                                     Unless the settlement date of a bond transaction coincides with the bond’s interest pay-
                                ment date, the cost of the bond to the buyer will include accrued interest. By the same token,
                                the proceeds to the seller will include accrued interest.
                                     Accrued interest is calculated from (including) the prior interest payment date—the last
                                coupon date—up to (but not including) the settlement date. The buyer owns the bond on the
                                settlement date, which means that the interest for that day belongs to the buyer.
                                     In computing accrued interest for corporate bonds, each month is assumed to have 30
                                interest days.

                                EXAMPLE                 A corporate bond paying interest on January 1 and July 1 is purchased on
                                                    Thursday, March 17, trade date. To compute the number of days of accrued interest
                                                    payable to the seller, start with the settlement date. Because corporate bonds settle
                                                    regular way, settlement date is Tuesday, March 22.

                                                         There are 21 interest days in March (interest accrues up to but not including
                                                    settlement date) and 30 days of interest for January and February. Interest begins ac-
                                                    cruing on January 1, which is the prior interest payment date.

                                EXAMPLE                 A corporate bond paying interest on February 15 and August 15 is purchased on
                                                    Tuesday, May 7, trade date. To compute accrued interest, start with the settlement
                                                    date, Friday, May 10. The computation is as follows:

                                                                         Days of Accrued Interest

                                                             16          30          30             9            85 days

                                                         The key is to recognize that interest begins to accrue on February 15. As there
                                                    are 30 interest days in each month, there are 16 days of accrued interest in February
                                                    (15th through the 30th, inclusive, is 16 days). If a corporate bond pays on the 15th,
                                                    the first month will have 16 days of accrued interest.



                  4. 14. 4 ASSIGNMENTS
                                         All stock and bond certificates must be assigned (endorsed by signature) by the owner,
                                    whose name is known to the registrar and printed on the face of the certificate. Upon the sale
                                    or transfer of the security, the owner must affix his signature on the place indicated on the back
                                    of the certificate. Alternatively, an endorsement may be made by signing a detached (separate)
                                    assignment, also known as a stock power or power of substitution.
                                         Any separate assignment must contain all of the same information as the assignment on
                                    the back of the certificate, including an irrevocable appointment of attorney (with power of
                                    substitution) and a full description of the security (e.g., name of issuer, issue, certificate num-
                                    ber, amount). One stock or bond power can be used with any number of certificates for one
                                    security, but a separate power is required for each different security.
                                         To avoid rejection by the transfer agent, all signatures must be guaranteed by a party
                                    acceptable to the transfer agent, such as a member clearing firm or a bank that participates
                                    in the NYSE medallion program. The NYSE developed the Medallion Signature Guarantee
                                    Program, which provides for the use of medallions by participants in place of signatures in
                                    effecting assignments.

                                     In addition to an annual fee, the administrative expenses are borne by the program’s par-
                                ticipants. The program covers all signatures placed on securities, stock and bond powers, CDs,
                                deeds, and so forth, and provides for indemnification insurance for participants in the case of
                                fraud. The program does not guarantee the certificate but rather the signature only.
                                     For nonparticipants, signature requirements are as follows.
                                ■■ For stock registered to an individual, the signature must exactly match the name registered
                                     on the face of the certificate.
                                ■■ For stock registered in joint names, the exact signature of all owners is required.
                                ■■ For stock registered in corporate name, interchangeable endorsements are acceptable
                                     (Acme Inc., Acme & Co., Acme and Co., Acme Company, and so forth).
                                ■■ For stock registered in the name of a deceased person, the only acceptable endorsement is
                                     that of the executor of the decedent’s estate.
                                ■■ For stock registered in the name of a minor child, the only acceptable endorsement is that
                                     of the custodian.
                                ■■ For stock registered in the name of a trust, the only acceptable endorsement is that of the
                                     trustee.


       4. 14. 5 AMERICAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS (ADR s )
                                     ADRs are investment vehicles allowing US investors to buy and sell foreign securities
                                without having to exchange dollars for foreign currency. ADRs, which are liquid, US-registered
                                securities, are issued by US commercial banks and registered with the SEC by filing Form F-6.
                                If the depositary receipt is traded outside the United States, it is called a Global Depositary
                                Receipt (GDR).




                     *
                    EXAMPLE                           The Shanghai branch of a US bank buys shares of Good Luck Wireless, Inc., puts
                                                 them in safekeeping, and then issues receipts for these shares to US investors. The
                                                 receipts are issued in a fixed ratio (e.g., two Good Luck shares underlie each receipt).
                                                 The receipts (ADRs) trade freely in the US market. Dividends are paid to the ADR
                                                 holder in US dollars, not renminbi.

                                   ADR holders:
                                ■■ do not have preemptive rights (the bank has these rights); however, the bank is required
                                   to sell the rights and distribute the proceeds pro rata to ADR holders;
                                ■■ do receive dividends (dividends are declared in the foreign currency and payable to hold-
                                   ers in US dollars; the currency exchange is performed by the bank); and
                                ■■ have the right to demand delivery of the underlying shares (there are several banks that
                                   can handle the conversion of the depositary receipt into the underlying shares).

                                    For purposes of delivery, ADRs are governed by the rules of the Uniform Practice Code.
                                Lastly, investors in ADRs are subject to a variety of risks including foreign currency risk, mar-
                                ket risk, and political risk.


                  4. 14. 6 FOREIGN INTERNAL SECURITIES
                                    A foreign internal security is a foreign security, not an ADR. Purchasing a foreign inter-
                                nal security involves the exchange of US dollars for foreign currency. While the rules of the
                                Uniform Practice Code apply to ADRs, the rules of the country where the security princi-
                                pally trades govern the clearance, settlement, and delivery of foreign internal securities. Lastly,
                                investors in ADRs are subject to a variety of risks, including foreign currency risk, market risk,
                                and political risk.


                        4. 14. 6. 1 Foreign Ordinary Share Trading
                                    Foreign ordinaries are shares issued by a foreign corporation that trade on a foreign
                                exchange, such as the Tokyo Stock Exchange. These shares may be traded in the United
                                States in the over-the-counter markets through a U.S. market maker.
                                    International trading access is not required, and orders are executed in US dollars. Those
                                foreign stocks that are not DTC eligible will likely be subject to additional fees.


                        4. 14. 6. 2 International Stock Trading
                                     For investors seeking to invest internationally, most common stock and ETFs listed on
                                markets, such as the London Stock Exchange in the UK or Spain’s Bolsa de Madrid, may be
                                entered at any time but will be executed during the local market hours. Other restrictions on
                                trading internationally include, no short selling, cash trades (no margin), and market and
                                limit orders only (no all-or-none or fill-or-kill orders). Trading in international stocks also
                                is limited to buying and selling the stock on the same market. A stock purchased from the
                                London Stock Exchange cannot then be sold on the Deutsche Börse (German Exchange).
                                DTCC’s Depository Trust Company (DTC) provides custody for millions of securities issues,
                                mostly stocks and bonds, from the United States and over a hundred other countries.


                  4. 14. 7 REJECTION AND RECLAMATION
                                    A buyer will reject delivery from a seller if the securities delivered are not in good form
                                (e.g., certificates are mutilated, there is no signature guarantee). A buyer also will reject deliv-
                                ery if delivery is made prior to settlement date.

                                    Reclamation, on the other hand, is available if a member inadvertently accepts a delivery
                                on settlement date and later discovers that the securities were not in good deliverable form.
                                Reclamation represents the right to return a security that had previously been accepted.
                                    A uniform reclamation form must accompany all reclamations. Any security returned to
                                the selling member without this form may be sold out by that member. Reclamation must be
                                made within the following periods.
                                ■■ If the certificates delivered have minor irregularities, the time frame for reclamation is 15
                                    days from delivery date.
                                ■■ If the certificates delivered are refused by the transfer agent (for whatever reason) or if the
                                    certificates are stolen or counterfeit, the time frame is 30 months from delivery date.
                                ■■ If the certificates are subject to partial call, there is no time limit for reclamation.

                                    There are two types of bond deliveries that are never subject to reclamation: (1) bond
                                certificates subject to an in-whole call, and (2) bonds where the issuer goes into default after

                  4. 14. 8 DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS
                                    When a corporation wants to make a quarterly distribution to shareholders, the corpora-
                                tion declares a record date, which is the date all shareholders of record as of the close of busi-
                                ness will receive the dividend. At that time, the corporation also announces a payable date,
                                which is the date on which the dividend will be sent to qualifying shareholders.

                                     In addition to these dates (declaration date, record date, and payable date), there is a
                                fourth date—the ex-dividend date—which is set and published by the market where the secu-
                                rity principally trades (e.g., the ex-dividend date is set by the NYSE if the stock is listed, and
                                by FINRA if the stock trades over the counter).


       4. 14. 9 EX-DATES
                                    The ex-date is the date on which the stock begins to trade without (ex) the dividend (if
                                stock is bought on the ex-date, the buyer will not receive the dividend). To receive the divi-
                                dend, the stock must be bought before the ex-date.
                                    Under Uniform Practice Rules, the ex-dates for cash and stock dividends as well as for
                                related distributions (e.g., stock splits) are as follows:
                                ■■ For regular way trades—two business days prior to record date
                                ■■ For cash settlement trades—one business day after record date

                                    For cash dividends in which the value of the dividend is 25% or more of the market value
                                of the stock, or where the number of shares in a stock dividend or stock split represents a 25%
                                or more increase, the ex-date is one business day after payable date.
                                    Buying on the ex-date in a regular way trade will not entitle the buying member to the
                                upcoming dividend as the trade will settle after record date. However, it might be tempting
                                to buy on the record date in a cash settlement transaction (same-day settlement) to capture
                                the dividend. In this case, the buying member will receive the dividend from the issuer, as the
                                buyer is the owner of record on the record date. However, then the selling member will simply
                                add the dividend to the price paid for the stock. So, there is no advantage in trying to capture
                                the dividend in this manner.
                                    The basic rule—to receive the dividend, the buyer must purchase the stock before the ex-
                                date—remains intact as the ex-date for this type of transaction is the business day after record
                                date.

                                                         The answer is yes. A trade taking place on June 16 is expected to settle regular
                                                    way (T+3) on the 21st, the record date. The ex-date in this case would be the 19th,
                                                    which is two business days prior to the record date. Occasionally, an investor and the
                                                    contra party agree to cash settlement, which is the same day. In that case, the effec-
                                                    tive ex-date would be the business day following the record date, which would be the
                                                    22nd. This cash settlement ex-dividend, or any ex-distribution, is not published and
                                                    handled for adjustments in the back office.



                  4. 14. 10 DUE BILLS
                                         Due bills are sent dealer to dealer when the wrong party receives the dividend from the
                                    issuer. This occurs for trades executed prior to the ex-date (thereby entitling the buyer to the
                                    dividend) that, for whatever reason, do not settle until after the record date. When this hap-
                                    pens, the buying member sends a due bill to the selling member for the amount of the dividend
                                    received by the selling member in error.
                                         The first day a stock trades without a due bill is the ex-date; a purchase on the ex-date
                                    does not entitle the buyer to the dividend. The buyer would not be due the dividend because
                                    of late settlement.

       4. 14. 11 OPEN ORDER ADJUSTMENTS
                                     The opening quotes for a Nasdaq stock are adjusted downward on the morning of the

                                must adjust downward any buy limit orders on their books. Buy limit orders are entered below
                                the prevailing market and could be inadvertently triggered by the ex-date reduction. Unless a

                                adjusts the limit price downward by the same amount the stock is reduced. Similarly, sell stop
                                orders also are reduced.
                                     Sell limit orders, which are entered above the prevailing market, are not adjusted for cash
                                dividends. All orders on the books of market makers are adjusted for stock dividends and stock
                                splits.

       4. 14. 15 COMPLETION OF A TRANSACTION
                                    A trade is considered complete on the settlement date, which, for regular way transac-
                                tions, is three business days following trade date. FINRA, however, defines completion of a
                                purchase transaction as when:
                                ■■ the customer pays in full or in part (margin) on settlement date;
                                ■■ the member firm makes the appropriate accounting entries on settlement date (this hap-
                                    pens if the customer has sufficient cash or SMA in the account to pay for the trade—in
                                    this case, the firm debits the customer’s money market fund and/or SMA on the settlement
                                    date); or
                                ■■ the securities are delivered into the account if the customer pays before settlement date.
                                    All of these definitions of completion of a purchase are mutually exclusive.

                                                      If the customer pays before settlement date, the trade is not considered complete
                                                 until the securities are delivered into the account, which should occur on settlement.

                                   Similarly, completion of a sale is defined as when:
                                ■■ the customer delivers the securities on settlement date to satisfy the sale;
                                ■■ the member firm makes the appropriate account entries on settlement date (this happens
                                   if the member is holding the customer’s securities; on settlement date, the member debits
                                   the customer’s securities position and credits the account with the sales proceeds); or
                                ■■ the sales proceeds are credited to the account if the customer delivers the securities before
                                   settlement date.


       4. 14. 16 COMPLETION OF A CUSTOMER SELL ORDER
                                    When a customer, who is in possession of the securities, places a sell order and fails to
                                deliver the securities by settlement date, the member firm, under SEC rules, must close out the
                                position (buy in the securities) after 10 business days from settlement date. In unusual circum-
                                stances, the member could apply to its DEA for an extension of time.

                                                 within 60 days of settlement date, the firm will be prohibited from selling that security
                                                 as principal and buying that security, as an agent, for a customer.

                  5. 1              LEGISLATIVE OVERVIEW


                  5. 1. 1               SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
                                            The primary purpose of the Securities Act of 1933 is to require full and fair disclosure in
                                        connection with the sale of securities to the public. Senate hearings in the 1920s and after the
                                        crash of 1929 uncovered widespread fraud in the issuance of securities. New issues were sold
                                        with little or no disclosure and could be purchased on margin with as little as 5% down.
                                            The act requires that a new issue, unless exempt, must be registered with the SEC before
                                        public sale. All investors must receive a detailed prospectus prior to purchase. Also, if the U.S.
                                        mail or other means of interstate commerce are used to sell a new issue, the requirements of
                                        the act apply.
                                            This act is sometimes referred to as the Prospectus Act, the Truth in Securities Act, the
                                        Paper Act, or the Full and Fair Disclosure Act. No matter what its nickname, it all points
                                        to one chief theme: to provide the public with sufficient, cogent information about publicly
                                        traded securities.

                                                             Interstate commerce represents transactions between states. If the security in-
                                                        volved in interstate commerce is a U.S.-issued security, the definition is expanded. For
                                                        instance, the wire transfer of U.S.-issued securities between San Juan, Puerto Rico,
                                                        and Washington, D.C., comes under the SEC as this is considered interstate com-
                                                        merce, even though neither point in the transaction is a U.S. state.
                                                            A basic rule: if the transaction is not intrastate, it is interstate.

                                                             Although a prospectus must be delivered to customers with the offer or sale of
                                                        mutual funds, unit trusts, follow-on dilutive offerings of common stock by public
                                                        reporting companies, ETFs need only make final and summary prospectuses available
                                                        (e.g., on a website, for viewing or downloading). There is no requirement to send one
                                                        to those who trade the exchange-traded fund, such as SPY on NYSE Arca. Publicly
                                                        traded closed-end funds also do not require the delivery of a prospectus.



                  5. 1. 2               DEFINITION OF A SECURITY
                                           A security can be defined as any investment in a common enterprise for profit, with man-
                                        agement performed by a third party. An element of risk must be present.
                                           Excluded from the definition of a security under the act are:
                                        ■■ CDs insured by the FDIC (no risk);
                                        ■■ fixed annuities (no risk);
                                        ■■ currencies (no third-party management); and
                                        ■■ futures contracts (no third-party management).

       5. 1. 3                  SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
                                    The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 was passed primarily to curb abuse in the secondary
                                (trading) markets. Among a great many other things, the act and its amendments accom-
                                plished the following:
                                ■■ Creation of the SEC, which was created and empowered to enforce federal securities laws;
                                    the SEC subsequently delegated some of its authority to various SROs
                                ■■ Requires the registration of broker-dealers and investment advisers
                                ■■ Requires the registration of securities exchanges and all national securities associations
                                ■■ Requires the registration of broker-dealer representatives with the appropriate SRO
                                ■■ Requires the registration of securities information processors (SIPs)
                                ■■ Requires the registration of municipal broker-dealers and municipal advisors
                                ■■ Empowered the Federal Reserve to control the extension of credit on securities transac-
                                    tions
                                ■■ Requires publicly traded issuers to file financial and operational reports with the SEC
                                ■■ Creation of rules dealing with insider trading
                                ■■ Creation of rules dealing with secondary market trading activity of market makers and
                                    underwriters

       5. 2             TYPES OF UNDERWRITINGS
                                     The new issue market consists of companies going public—privately owned businesses
                                raising capital by selling common stock to the public for the first time. New issue securities
                                also are known as initial public offering (IPO) securities. The additional issue market is made
                                up of new securities issues from companies that are already publicly owned. These companies
                                are now increasing their equity capitalization by issuing more stock.

                                            In addition to being classified by whether they represent initial or additional issues of new
                                        securities, offerings can be classified by the final distribution of their proceeds.

                                                             Additional issue offerings are sometimes referred to as follow-on or add-on
                                                        offerings.



                  5. 2. 1               PRIMARY OFFERINGS
                                             A primary offering is one in which the proceeds of the underwriting go to the issuer. A
                                        corporation increases its capitalization by selling stock (either a new issue or previously autho-
                                        rized but unissued stock). It may do this at any time and in any amount, provided the total
                                        stock outstanding never exceeds the amount authorized in the corporation’s bylaws. Although
                                        there are exceptions, the 1933 Securities Act requires that securities being offered to the pub-
                                        lic be done so by prospectus.


                  5. 2. 2               SECONDARY OFFERINGS
                                            A secondary offering (aka secondary distribution) is one in which one or more major
                                        stockholders in the corporation are selling all or a major portion of their holdings. The under-
                                        writing proceeds are paid to the stockholders rather than to the corporation. Typically, second-
                                        ary offerings occur in situations in which the founder of a business, and perhaps some of the
                                        original financial backers, determine that there is more to be gained by going public than by
                                        staying private.
                                                                              Offerings and Markets

                  5. 2. 3               SPLIT OFFERINGS
                                            A split offering is a combination of a primary and a secondary offering. Some of the
                                        stock offered will be issued by the corporation, and the rest represents shares held by present
                                        stockholders.


                  5. 2. 4               SHELF REGISTRATION (RULE 415)
                                           Rule 415 of Regulation C of the Securities Act of 1933 permits issuers to quickly raise
                                        money in the capital markets when needed or when market conditions are just right. For

                                with a base prospectus, sometimes known as a core prospectus, along with a prospectus supple-
                                ment, which defines the terms of current offering and other information omitted from the
                                prospectus. That must be filed with the Commission no later than the second business day
                                following the date of the determination of the offering price, or the date it is first used after
                                effectiveness in connection with a public offering or sale, whichever is earlier. There is some,
                                but not much of a delay.
                                     For those issuers who are eligible to use the SEC Form S-3 (discussed later in this Unit),
                                registration statements must contain (by reference) all the issuer’s reports filed with the SEC,
                                such as the 10-K, 8-K, et cetera, after the shelf offering’s effective date. Since market partici-
                                pants are deemed up-to-date with the business operations, there is, in this case, no need to file
                                a supplement (aka post-effective amendment). Once the shelf has its effective date there will
                                be no delay whatsoever for the SEC to review the terms of the offering.
                                     The expression takedown has multiple meanings. In one sense it is the amount received
                                by members of an underwriting syndicate. When used in connection with a Rule 415 shelf
                                offering, it means taking down securities off the shelf.




                     *
                    EXAMPLE                           An issuer wants to sell $300 million of five-year AA/Aa2-rated notes, but only
                                                 when market interest rates allow the sale to be made on a 6.40 basis. The current
                                                 market is somewhat oversold and rates for five-year investment grade notes are
                                                 about 6.55. If the issuer waits for rates to fall 15 basis points and then files a regis-
                                                 tration statement with the SEC, rates may move back up before the registration is
                                                 effective.

                                     To address this type of situation, an issuer files a shelf registration statement with the SEC,
                                which, once effective, is good for two years. Therefore, as soon as rates fall, the issuer has an
                                effective registration statement in place and can sell the five-year notes with little delay. This
                                permits issuers to match financing needs with market conditions. For certain well-known, sea-
                                soned issuers (WKSI—pronounced wik´-see), discussed later in this Unit, the two-year period
                                is extended to three years.


       5. 2. 5                  AT-THE-MARKET OFFERINGS
                                    An at-the-market offering is an additional issue offering with no fixed offering price. The
                                shares are to be sold at the market when the offering is effective. The additional shares could
                                be sold at different prices once effective.


       5. 2. 6                  NEGOTIATED VERSUS COMPETITIVE
                                    Underwritings can be classified as either negotiated or competitive. A negotiated under-
                                writing is one in which the issuer selects an underwriter and negotiates the terms of the offer-
                                ing. A competitive offering is one in which the issuer announces its intention to solicit bids

                                        from underwriters and selects a firm based on net interest cost. The winning bid is the one that
                                        provides the issuer with the lowest net interest cost.

                                                           Most corporate underwritings are done on a negotiated basis, while U.S. govern-

                  5. 2. 7               ALTERNATIVE PUBLIC OFFERING (APO)
                                            An APO is sometimes referred to as a reverse takeover where shareholders of a private
                                        company choose to gain control of a company whose stock is publicly traded and merge it with
                                        their private company.
                                            A public company that is registered with the SEC and merged with the private com-
                                        pany permits the private company to avoid the expensive and onerous review by regulators.
                                        However, comprehensive disclosure is filed on Form 8-K (current report) immediately upon
                                        completion of a reverse merger transaction.
                                            Going public through this reverse takeover process permits a privately held company to
                                        become a public cheaper and very likely with less stock dilution than through an IPO.



                  5. 3              TYPES OF UNDERWRITING COMMITMENTS


                  5. 3. 1               FIRM COMMITMENT
                                            The firm commitment is the most widely used type of underwriting contract. Under its
                                        terms, the underwriter contracts with the issuing corporation, selling stockholders, or both to
                                        buy the securities described in the contract, within a defined price and quantity range, on or
                                        about a given date—all of which is explained in a letter of intent signed by both the under-
                                        writer and the issuer during the early stages of negotiation.
                                            Although this letter of intent is conditional, for all practical purposes, the underwriter is
                                        committing to buying securities from the issuer and paying the underwriting proceeds to the
                                        company. The underwriter does this without full assurance that the securities can be resold
                                        to the public at a profit. If part of an issue that is being distributed under a firm commitment
                                        contract goes unsold, any losses incurred are borne by the syndicate members.

                                                        tee to determine if the firm, based on the results of their due diligence, should commit
                                                        its resources to a particular offering.

       5. 3. 2                  BEST EFFORTS
                                    A best efforts arrangement calls for the underwriter to buy securities from the issuer as
                                agent, not as principal. The underwriters are not committed and therefore are not at risk. The
                                underwriters will use their best efforts to sell all of the issue but will not give any assurances
                                that they will sell any of the securities.




                     *
                    EXAMPLE                          If a corporation’s plan is to issue 100,000 shares of common stock at $20 per
                                                 share, but—after exerting best efforts—the underwriter is able to distribute only
                                                 80,000 shares, the extent of the underwriter’s commitment is limited to 80,000 shares
                                                 and not the full 100,000 shares.


             5. 3. 2. 1             All-or-None Offerings
                                    In an all-or-none offering, if the underwriters are unable to sell all of the securities being
                                offered within a prescribed time frame, the offering is canceled.


             5. 3. 2. 2             Mini-Max Offerings
                                     Like an all-or-none offering, a mini-max underwriting is a form of best-efforts offering with
                                a floor and a ceiling on the number of shares the issuer is willing to sell.




                     *
                    EXAMPLE                          An issuer wants to sell 200,000 shares (ceiling) to the public but is willing to
                                                 accept a sale of 120,000 shares (floor). If the underwriters are able to sell the floor
                                                 amount within a prescribed time frame, the offering is effective. If not, the offering is
                                                 canceled.


                                5. 3. 2. 2. 1 Escrow for Contingent Offerings
                                   Under SEC Rule 15c2-4, all customer checks representing purchases at the offering price
                                must be placed in an escrow account at a qualified financial institution (QFI) if the offering is
                                contingent on the successful sale of a minimum number of shares. This rule applies to all-or-
                                none and mini-max offerings.

                                                      Monies deposited or transmitted into an independent bank escrow account may
                                                 include saving accounts and bank money market accounts. The SEC’s Division of
                                                 Market Regulation also will accept investments in short-term CDs issued by a bank
                                                 or short-term securities issued or guaranteed by the United States. The bank escrow
                                                 agent must take care to not place funds in instruments whose maturity date would
                                                 exceed any contingency date. A savings and loan does not meet the definition of a

                  5. 3. 3               STANDBY UNDERWRITINGS
                                            Standby underwritings come into play when a publicly held corporation proposes to issue
                                        additional common stock. The corporation may be obligated to protect the proportional own-
                                        ership interest of the current stockholders (subject to the securities laws of the issuer’s state of
                                        incorporation). If this is the case, the company must first offer any additional issue of the same
                                        class of stock to the existing stock owners before offering the securities to the general public.
                                        This is done through a subscription rights offering.
                                            Typically, any number of a company’s current stockholders will not exercise their preemp-
                                        tive rights (right of first refusal). Therefore, the issuing company will not sell all the additional
                                        shares. To ensure that all of the additional issues will be sold, a standby underwriter is engaged.
                                        This firm unconditionally agrees (firm commitment) to buy all shares not subscribed to by
                                        shareholders.



                  5. 4              ORGANIZING THE UNDERWRITING


                  5. 4. 1               UNDERWRITER ENGAGEMENT
                                             To sell securities, an issuer will engage an investment banker who will review the proposed
                                        underwriting and recommend a specific structure. After the basic terms of the underwriting
                                        are negotiated and agreed to by both parties, the banker issues a letter of intent to the issuer,
                                        defining the basic underwriting terms.
                                             The letter of intent also addresses the risks the underwriter is willing to assume and the
                                        risks that will be assumed by the issuer. One risk the underwriter never assumes is the risk that
                                        an event will occur that will affect the investment merit of the securities (after the signing of
                                        a letter of intent but before registration is effective).

                                                         its commitment by invoking the market-out clause contained in the letter.

                                                         to a statutory disqualification, compensated based on sales, and associated with
                                                         any broker-dealer. As a practical matter, Rule 3a4-1 will only come into play in small
                                                         offerings.

       5. 4. 2                  SYNDICATE FORMATION
                                    The investment bank that negotiates with the issuer is the managing underwriter. To
                                reduce risk, the manager forms a syndicate, inviting other member firms into the underwriting
                                group. Once formed, the syndicate members sign an agreement, called the agreement among
                                underwriters, which details the responsibilities and obligations of each syndicate member.
                                    The syndicate manager in a firm commitment underwriting often is referred to as the
                                statutory (or lead) underwriter. You also may see this person referred to as the book runner
                                or bookrunning manager.


       5. 4. 3                  SELLING GROUP FORMATION
                                     To broaden distribution channels, the manager selects other member firms to assist in the
                                sale of the securities. These members comprise the selling group. Unlike syndicate members,
                                selling group firms assume no risk for the underwriting. They act solely as agents in the distri-
                                bution of the new issue.
                                     The manager negotiates contract terms with each selling group member, which will be
                                memorialized in the selected dealer agreement. The agreements set forth the estimated public
                                offering price (or a range) and under what circumstances a selling concession will be allowed.
                                By signing the agreement, each member of the selling group becomes obligated to sell the new
                                issue at the public offering price.

                                                      Under SEC rules, a selling group is formed after the filing of a registration
                                                 statement.



       5. 4. 4                  AGREEMENT AMONG UNDERWRITERS (AAU)
                                    The topics addressed in this agreement, which is signed by all syndicate members, include
                                the following.


             5. 4. 4. 1             Participation of Each Syndicate Member
                                    The level of participation of each syndicate member is the percentage of the offering each
                                syndicate member is obligated to buy from the issuer.


             5. 4. 4. 2             Manager’s Fee
                                    The manager’s fee is the amount, expressed in cents per share, that the syndicate manager
                                earns for each share sold. It is the compensation the manager receives for overseeing all regula-
                                tory filings connected with the new issue and for making all decisions on behalf of the other
                                syndicate members.

                                    Liability for Unsold Securities. If the syndicate is unable to sell all the securities pur-
                                chased from the issuer, the unsold securities remain in the syndicate account. The liability
                                for these unsold shares rests with the syndicate members on either a divided (Western ac-
                                count) or undivided (Eastern account) basis.

                                     Shares Trading at a Premium. The agreement among underwriters must state that,
                                 consistent with Regulation M, the book-running lead manager and the other syndicate
                                 members must require that any shares trading at a premium to the public offering price that
                                 are returned by the buyer after secondary trading has begun to:
                                 ■■ be used to offset the existing syndicate short position; or
                                 ■■ if no syndicate short position exists, the member must either
                                     —— offer returned shares at the public offering price to unfilled customers’ orders pursuant
                                        to a random allocation methodology, or
                                     —— sell returned shares on the secondary market and donate profits from the sale to an
                                        unaffiliated charitable organization with the condition that the donation be treated as
                                        an anonymous donation.


                        5. 4. 4. 3   Provision, If Any, for Overallotment
                                      If the syndicate manager, based on anticipated demand, wants to sell more shares than ini-
                                 tially registered with the SEC, the manager can invoke the green shoe clause on short selling.
                                 A green shoe clause, negotiated and agreed to by the issuer, allows the syndicate to sell up to
                                 15% more shares than initially registered within 30 days of the IPO trading. The additional
                                 shares are made available to the syndicate by the issuer.
                                      To be effective, a green shoe clause must be disclosed in both the registration statement
                                 filed with the SEC and the prospectus.
                                      A more dangerous way to overallot would be to short sell. In this case, the syndicate is
                                 selling more shares than it buys from the issuer, and delivery to purchasers at the offering price
                                 is accomplished by buying back shares in the secondary market. If demand is strong, short
                                 covering will be done at a loss. How that loss is shared by the syndicate members is described
                                 in the agreement among underwriters.


                        5. 4. 4. 4   Concession
                                    The concession is the amount, expressed in cents per share, that represents the gross profit
                                 made by members of the selling group for each share sold by those members.


                        5. 4. 4. 5   Reallowance
                                     With the permission of the manager, a syndicate or selling group member may sell the new
                                 issue to a member that is not part of the underwriting group. This firm must agree to sell the
                                 new issue at the public offering price.
                                     The compensation earned by this firm is termed a reallowance, which is generally one-half
                                 of the concession.

       5. 4. 5                  UNDERWRITING COMPENSATION
                                    There always is a spread between the price at which underwriters buy stock from issuers
                                and the price at which they offer the shares to the public. The price to the issuer is referred
                                to as the underwriting proceeds, and the price to the buying investors as the public offering
                                price (POP).
                                    The underwriting spread consists of three major components:
                                ■■ Manager’s fee for negotiating the deal and managing the entire underwriting and public
                                    distribution process
                                ■■ Underwriting fee for assuming the risk of buying securities from the issuer without assur-
                                    ance that any or all of the securities can be resold
                                ■■ Selling concession for finding and placing the securities with investors

                                    In general, underwriters tend to conform with industry standards and normal practices
                                with regard to the makeup of the spread and the percentage accounted for by each of the three
                                components.
                                    The syndicate manager’s fee is the smallest percentage, and the selling concession is the
                                largest. Expenses come out of the underwriting fee.




                     *
                    EXAMPLE                           Assume a 1 million share initial public offering of common stock. Shares will be
                                                 sold to the public for $10.00, and the underwriting spread is $.65 per share. The fol-
                                                 lowing illustration depicts the distribution of the spread and proceeds of the under-
                                                 writing. The $.65 spread is allocated as follows.
                                                      ■■ Syndicate manager’s fee: compensation for the manager’s role in the
                                                         underwriting—in this case, $.12 per share, or $120,000 for 1 million shares.
                                                         The manager’s fee is typically the smallest portion of the spread.

                                                      ■■ Underwriting fee: this portion of the spread compensates syndicate members
                                                         for the risk they assume in the underwriting. The underwriting fee—in this
                                                         case, $.13 per share—is allocated to syndicate members on the basis of their
                                                         participation.

                                                      ■■ Selling concession: the largest portion of the spread is the selling concession,
                                                         the amount received by any member that sells the shares. In this case, the
                                                         concession is $.40 per share.

                                   The amount of the spread varies by issue and can be influenced by any of the following.
                                ■■ Type of commitment: A firm commitment earns a larger spread than a best efforts agree-
                                   ment because of the risks the underwriter assumes.
                                ■■ Security’s marketability: A bond rated AAA has a smaller spread than a speculative stock.
                                ■■ Issuer’s business: A stable utility stock usually has a smaller spread than a more volatile
                                   stock.
                                ■■ Offering size: In a very large offering, the underwriter can spread costs over a larger number
                                   of shares; thus, the per-share cost may be lower, resulting in a smaller spread.

                                          to the extent of their participation. In the example, syndicate members 1 and 3 are
                                          liable for $20 million each, which represents their unsold allotment. Members 2 and 4
                                          are not liable, as each sold its agreed-upon participation.
                                                If the syndicate is undivided (Eastern account), all syndicate members share in the
                                          liability based on their percentage participation. Syndicate member 1 is liable for 40%
                                          of the unsold securities, syndicate member 2 for 30%, and so forth.

       5. 5. 1                  FILING THE REGISTRATION STATEMENT
                                    To register a new issue of securities with the SEC, a first-time issuer may file a registration
                                statement using SEC Form S-1 (or Form F-6 for ADRs, Form S-11 for REITs or Form 20-F for
                                foreign private issuer). Included in the statement are the following:
                                ■■ A detailed description of the business and its history
                                ■■ Audited financial statements and related financial information on capitalization
                                ■■ Information on the anticipated use of the proceeds
                                ■■ Biographical data on the officers and directors of the issuer
                                ■■ Information on risk factors including competition, legal proceedings pending against the
                                    issuer, the regulatory environment, and so forth
                                ■■ Information on the issuer’s dividend policy
                                ■■ The proposed price (or range) of the issue and the anticipated underwriting spread
                                ■■ Prospectus

                                                      Although the SEC Form S-1 is commonly used by established companies to regis-
                                                 ter their securities, there are many other forms that can be used by issuers, including
                                                 SB-1, which is used by small business issuers to register offerings of $10 million or
                                                 less, provided the issuer has not registered more than $10 million in securities over the
                                                 preceding 12 months. If any registration form is amended before the end of the wait-
                                                 ing period, the amendment is effective immediately. Another notable form is the S-3,
                                                 used by well-known seasoned issuers (WKSI) who have, for example, issued $1 billion
                                                 in nonconvertible securities in the past three years. Also note that Form S-4 is used to
                                                 report mergers and acquisitions to the SEC. The Form F-6 is used to register deposi-
                                                 tary shares, such as American depositary receipts (ADRs). The Form S-11 is used for
                                                 registration of securities issued by real estate investment trusts (REITS).

                                                           the corporate level and the shareholder level. Shareholders are taxed on dividends
                                                           received that are paid out of income already taxed. S corporations, on the other hand,
                                                           are taxed like partnerships: income from the corporation flows through to the share-

                        5. 5. 1. 1          Waiting Period
                                            Once the registration statement is filed, the issuer enters into a waiting period. At this
                                        time, the SEC makes a comprehensive review of the statement for full and fair disclosure. The
                                        waiting period is intended to provide time during which the investing public and other mem-
                                        ber firms will have the opportunity to become informed about the new issue without having
                                        to make an immediate decision.

                                                              The syndicate may be formed before or after the filing of a registration state-

                        5. 5. 1. 2          Preliminary Prospectus
                                             After filing, offers, but not sales, can be made to the investing public by means of a pre-
                                        liminary prospectus. A preliminary prospectus, also called a red herring, can be used to take
                                        nonbinding indications of interest. A red herring can be quickly prepared, because it is part of
                                        the registration statement, five copies of which must be filed with the SEC if it varies from the
                                        form of prospectus included in the registration statement. SEC rules permit the omission of

                                                      In taking indications of interest, it may be tempting for a registered representative
                                                 to highlight parts of a red herring to focus the customer on what the representative
                                                 believes to be the key issues. Marking or highlighting a prospectus is a violation of
                                                 federal securities law and can lead to termination of employment and other severe
                                                 penalties.

                                     If a member receives a check from a customer during the waiting period that is earmarked
                                for the purchase of shares of the new issue, the member must return the check. Placing the
                                check in the customer’s account could be viewed as a sale, not an offer, which is prohibited
                                until the offering is effective.

                                    Due Diligence. During the waiting period, underwriters must conduct a formal due dili-
                                gence meeting for the benefit of investors who want information about the issue, the issuer’s
                                financial background, and the intended use of the proceeds. For issues that are expected
                                to attract national interest, meetings might be scheduled at different locations around the
                                country. Representatives of the issuer and the managing underwriter attend these meetings
                                and answer questions from brokers, securities analysts, and the public.

                                    Insufficient Disclosure. If the SEC believes that there is not sufficient disclosure in the
                                registration statement, the issuer receives a deficiency letter from the Commission requir-
                                ing additional disclosures. Until disclosure is adequate, registration is not effective. If no
                                information requests are received from the SEC or, if received, are satisfactorily resolved, the
                                registration is effective at the conclusion of the waiting period.

                                     Material Omissions or Misleading Information. If it appears to the SEC that the reg-
                                istration statement contains material omissions or misleading information, the SEC issues a
                                stop order suspending the registration process, because the statement needs a rewrite. When
                                an amended statement is filed, the waiting period begins again.

                                                 for additional disclosure.


             5. 5. 1. 3             Final Prospectus
                                    Just before the effective date, a determination as to final pricing is made and a final pro-
                                spectus is prepared. At that time, a formal underwriting agreement is signed by the issuer and
                                the syndicate manager. Once the issue is declared effective by the SEC, sales can be confirmed.
                                    Once an issue is effective (cleared by the SEC), the issuer appears to have met all the fil-
                                ing and disclosure requirements. The SEC never expresses an opinion on the securities being
                                offered. In fact, SEC Rule 425 requires that the following disclaimer be printed on the front
                                cover of every prospectus:

                                        Neither the SEC nor any state securities commission has determined whether this
                                    prospectus is truthful or complete. Nor have they made, nor will they make, any deter-
                                    mination as to whether anyone should buy these securities. Any representation to the
                                    contrary is a criminal offense.

                        5. 5. 1. 4          Forward-Looking Statements
                                             Any statements that are not based on historical fact are forward-looking statements. A
                                        forward-looking statement predicts, projects, or uses future events as expectations or possibili-
                                        ties. Although such statements are based on management’s estimates and expectations and
                                        available competitive, financial, and economic data, they are inherently uncertain. A variety
                                        of factors could cause the results to differ significantly from what is contained in any forward-
                                        looking statements. Put another way, these statements are subject to numerous assumptions,
                                        risks, and uncertainties that change over time.
                                             When shareholders ask company management about what they sense will be the likely
                                        business environment in the future, there is an implicit understanding that certain statements
                                        are speculative; nevertheless, the SEC demands that public companies include a disclaimer on
                                        discussions with investors in order to emphasize this point. When properly emphasized, stock-
                                        holders generally may not take legal action against company management for forward-looking
                                        statements, which prove to be erroneous. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
                                        1995 provides certain safe harbor provisions against fraud claims dealing with forward-looking
                                        statements.
                                             While it is clear that no one can predict the future, management often is in the best posi-
                                        tion to identify emerging trends and to speak about the company’s response.
                                             Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 demands certain standards in com-
                                        munication. Issuers must identify these statements by the use of certain prescribed words, such
                                        as estimate, anticipate, predict, expect, and potential.
                                             Regulation S-K establishes guidelines to be used when preparing projections and exhibits.
                                        The basis of the projections must be reasonable and the time frame used must be appropriate.
                                        In addition, S-K requires that the underwriting agreement, an issuer’s certificate of incorpora-
                                        tion and by-laws, et cetera, be included in the registration statement.
                                             The SEC permits, but does not require, an outside review of the projections made. If an
                                        issuer uses an outside reviewer, it must disclose:
                                        ■■ the qualifications of the reviewer;
                                        ■■ the extent of the review;
                                        ■■ the relationship between the reviewer and the issuer; and
                                        ■■ all material factors regarding the review process and how the outside review was obtained
                                             or sought.

                                            Regulation S-X is critical, because it looks to the qualifications of accountants who are
                                        acceptable to the Commission. For example, is the accountancy firm registered and in good
                                        standing in the state in which they operate and are they independent from the client company?

                                    Lastly, Regulation S-X governs the form and content of financial statements directing the
                                efforts of accountants on proper terminology and accuracy in the implementation of generally
                                accepted accounting principals (GAAP) adopted by the SEC.

                                                      The applicability of a safe harbor for forward-looking statements does not extend
                                                 to blank check companies, rollup transactions, or to issues of penny stocks.


             5. 5. 1. 5             Civil Liability
                                    All persons who sign the registration statement (officers and directors of the issuer, accoun-
                                tants and attorneys representing the issuer, et cetera) are potentially liable for damages if there
                                is an omission or misstatement of material facts. Suits alleging fraud in connection with any
                                offering of securities must be brought within two years after the discovery of the facts consti-
                                tuting the violation but no later than five years after such violation.
                                    Civil penalties apply when the omission or misstatement is unintentional. If the fraud is
                                willful, then criminal penalties, which consist of a $10,000 fine, five years in prison, or both,
                                apply. Civil penalties are generally limited to the loss sustained by the investor.

       5. 5. 2                  UNIFORM SECURITIES ACT (USA)
                                    In addition to registering new issues with the SEC prior to public sale, an issuer must also
                                register the security in each state in which it is to be sold, unless an exemption is available.
                                These registration requirements and exemptions are provided by the Uniform Securities Act
                                (USA), which is state law, and the National Securities Markets Improvements Act of 1996
                                (NSMIA), which is a federal law, rather than the Securities Act of 1933.
                                    The USA provides two methods for securities issuers to register their securities in a state,
                                plus a special method for certain federal covered securities. They are:
                                ■■ notice filing;
                                ■■ coordination; and
                                ■■ qualification.


             5. 5. 2. 1             Notice Filing
                                     The previously mentioned National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996
                                (NSMIA) designated certain securities as federal covered and, therefore, removed them from
                                the jurisdiction of the state regulatory authorities. Federal covered securities include those
                                listing on most of the U.S. stock exchanges as well as registered investment companies (e.g.,
                                mutual funds). Although the states are preempted from requiring registration for federal cov-
                                ered securities, status as a federal covered security is not a pre­emption of the anti-fraud laws.

                                     The Uniform Securities Act gives the administrator the authority to require notice filings
                                 with respect to federal covered securities, which are often investment companies registered
                                 with the SEC under the Investment Company Act of 1940. So, what is this notice filing?
                                 Primarily, it is an opportunity for the states to collect revenue in the form of filing fees because,
                                 unlike with the other methods of registration, the administrator has limited powers to review
                                 any documentation filed with his department.


                        5. 5. 2. 2   Coordination
                                      The most common form of registration for those securities that are not federal covered
                                 (typically securities traded on the OTC Bulletin Board or the OTC Pink marketplace, for-
                                 merly known as the Pink Sheets) is coordination. A security may be registered by coordination
                                 if a registration statement has been filed under the Securities Act of 1933 in connection with
                                 the same offering.
                                      Registration by coordination becomes effective at the same time the federal registration
                                 becomes effective.

                        5. 5. 2. 3   Qualification
                                     This method is the most difficult in terms of filing requirements. It can be used by a first-
                                 time issuer that wants to register in only one state (a Rule 147 offering). It also can be used
                                 by an existing issuer that wants to increase the number of states in which its securities can be
                                 sold. The registration is effective as determined by the state Administrator, generally 30 days
                                 after filing.
                                     Certain securities are exempt from being formally registered with a state. These include:
                                 ■■ U.S. government and municipal issues;
                                 ■■ securities issued or guaranteed by a foreign government with which the United States has
                                     diplomatic relations; and
                                 ■■ federal covered securities under the NSMIA (although the “informal” notice filing may
                                     be required); if the common stock of an issuer is federal covered, all of the issuer’s other
                                     securities also are exempt.

                                      State securities laws, also known as blue-sky laws, affect solicitations directed out of a
                                 particular state and solicitations directed into a particular state. Thus, these laws apply to
                                 offers that come into a state from any other location and offers that go out of a state to any
                                 other location.
                                      While there are exceptions, member firms and their registered representatives must be reg-
                                 istered as broker-dealers and agents, respectively, in each state in which they conduct business.

                                     In certain offerings, a final prospectus must be delivered by all members to buyers in the
                                secondary market for a specified period following the effective date. This is termed the pro-
                                spectus delivery requirement period and is discussed in the following section. This can be
                                satisfied by the access equals delivery rule discussed later in this Unit.

                                     Following a company’s filing of a registration statement with the SEC through its EDGAR
                                system begins the waiting period. Issuers and their underwriters must take care not to try to
                                favorably condition the market by gun-jumping, which could greatly delay the effective date.
                                The Commission could respond to gun-jumping by calling for a cooling-off period to allow
                                the effect of advertisements and speeches, et cetera, to fade. (Gun-jumping is discussed later
                                in this Unit.) It is a common practice for a company to file a preliminary prospectus with the
                                SEC simultaneously with the registration statement. Although the preliminary prospectus
                                may be found on the SEC’s website, it is not circulated to prospective investors. However, a
                                broker-dealer participating in a distribution must deliver a copy of the preliminary prospectus
                                to any person who is expected to receive a confirmation of sale at least 48 hours prior to the
                                sending of a confirmation.
                                     During the post-effective period, which begins when the Commission declares the regis-
                                tration statement effective, if the securities are listed on an exchange, such as the NYSE or
                                NASDAQ, a prospectus is delivered for 25 days following the effective date or 90 days if the
                                security is to be quoted in the OTC Pink marketplace or over the OTCBB (non-Nasdaq). If
                                the registration statement relates to an offering of securities of a “blank check company,” the
                                period for prospectus delivery requirement does not terminate until 90 days after the date
                                funds are released from the escrow.
                                     A free writing prospectus (FWP) is permitted following the effective date but only is
                                accompanied or preceded by the prospectus.


             5. 5. 3. 2             Prospectus Delivery Requirements for Additional Issue Offerings
                                    If the security is listed, a prospectus must be delivered only in connection with purchases
                                at the public offering price, and once the distribution is complete, there is no obligation
                                to deliver a prospectus in secondary market transactions. If the security is an OTC Equity
                                Security, the prospectus delivery requirement period is 40 days.


             5. 5. 3. 3             Contents of Prospectus Used After Nine Months
                                    For those prospectuses used more than 9 months after the effective date, such as in con-
                                nection with mutual funds, any information previously required to be contained in the pro-
                                spectus may be omitted if later information covering the same subjects, including the latest
                                available certified financial statement, as of a date not more than 16 months prior to the use
                                of the prospectus, is contained.

                                     If there is a prospectus delivery requirement period and the information in the prospectus
                                 becomes misleading due to a material development (e.g., a patent approval, or the loss of a
                                 major customer), the issuer has the obligation to update the information. This can be done by
                                 stickering the outside cover page with the updated information. Stickering a prospectus can
                                 be done as soon as the new information is filed with the SEC—it is effective immediately with
                                 the SEC.


                  5. 5. 4        PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS
                                     As a general statement, once a registration statement is filed, the Securities Act of 1933
                                 prohibits the advertisement of the new issue. Rule 134 and 135 set guidelines for communica-
                                 tions, which are permitted during the waiting period. These are tombstone advertisements and
                                 are limited in scope.


                        5. 5. 4. 1   Tombstone Advertisements
                                    Tombstone advertisements under Rule 134 are prepared by the syndicate manager and are
                                 generally placed in financial media on or before the effective date of the offering. A tombstone
                                 advertisement is limited to information on the:
                                 ■■ name of the issuer;
                                 ■■ type of security being offered;
                                 ■■ number of shares to be sold;
                                 ■■ public offering price (or a range); and
                                 ■■ names of the syndicate members.

                                     Rule 135 addresses tombstone advertisements placed by the issuer, not the syndicate man-
                                 ager. Under this rule, when an issuer files a registration statement with the SEC, it may place
                                 a tombstone advertisement. The advertisement includes all the information in a Rule 134
                                 advertisement with one exception: an issuer’s advertisement cannot include the names of the
                                 syndicate members.
                                     All tombstone advertisements must contain the following advisory:

                                         This announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer for any of these
                                     securities. This offer is made only by prospectus.

                        5. 5. 4. 2          Research Report Distributions
                                            Rule 137 allows broker-dealers that are not participating in the underwriting to publish
                                        research on the new issue if:
                                        ■■ the recommendation is published in the normal course of its business;
                                        ■■ the firm received no compensation, directly or indirectly, from any participant in the
                                            underwriting, including the issuer, selling shareholders (if any), syndicate members, and
                                            selling group members; and
                                        ■■ the issuer is not, nor has been in the past three years
                                            —— a blank check company, or
                                            —— an issuer of an offering of penny stock.
                                            Rule 138 allows broker-dealers that are participating in the distribution to publish research
                                        on securities of the issuer that are nonequivalent to the security being underwritten.




                                  *
                                 EXAMPLE                    If ABCD were issuing new shares of its common stock, the underwriting partici-
                                                        pants could publish research on nonconvertible debt or nonconvertible preferred stock
                                                        of ABCD. Distribution participants would, however, be prohibited from publishing
                                                        research on convertible debt or convertible preferred securities of ABCD, as these are
                                                        considered equivalent.

                                            For additional issue offerings, these research prohibitions created a conflict between the
                                        information needs of the market and the SEC’s sensitivity to any action that would condition
                                        the market to be more receptive to a new issue. The Securities Act of 1933 is clear: sales can
                                        only be made through a prospectus.
                                            To mediate the conflict, the SEC adopted Rule 139, which only applies to additional issue
                                        offerings that meet the definition of an actively traded security (discussed later in this Unit).
                                            Rule 139 allows research to be published by distribution participants on the security being
                                        underwritten if the following conditions are met.
                                        ■■ The recommendation is contained in a publication that is distributed with reasonable
                                            regularity in the normal course of business and includes recommendations on other com-
                                            panies in the issuer’s industry or contains a comprehensive list of all securities being rec-
                                            ommended by the firm.
                                        ■■ The recommendation is given no greater space or prominence in the publication than that
                                            given to other recommendations.
                                        ■■ The current recommendation is no more favorable than in the past.

        5. 5. 5                  SEC OFFERING REFORMS
                                    The SEC has adopted flexible rules relating to the offering process. The following defini-
                                tions and rules, which are not available to penny stock issuers, are summarized as follows.


             5. 5. 5. 1             Issuer Classes
                                     The rules divide issuers into four primary classes, each entitled to varying degrees of flex-
                                ibility in offering securities to the public.
                                ■■ Well-known seasoned issuers (WKSIs). To qualify as a WKSI, an issuer must have at
                                     least $700 million in common equity held by nonaffiliates. Alternatively, an issuer can
                                     qualify if, during the preceding three years, it issued at least $1 billion in nonconvertible
                                     debt securities.
                                ■■ Seasoned issuers. To qualify, an issuer must have at least $75 million in public float value.
                                ■■ Unseasoned issuers are public companies required to file reports with the SEC but that
                                     are not seasoned issuers.
                                ■■ Nonreporting issuers are companies not required to file reports with the SEC (e.g., pri-
                                     vately held companies).


             5. 5. 5. 2             Shelf Registration
                                    For WKSIs, a shelf registration statement is effective immediately.


             5. 5. 5. 3             Liberalizing Communications
                                    SEC offering rules permit communications by all classes of issuers more than 30 days before
                                a registration statement filing if they do not reference the upcoming offering.
                                    The rules permit a type of written communication called a free writing prospectus. During
                                the period following the filing of a registration statement, all classes of issuers may make writ-
                                ten offers in the form of a free writing prospectus. This type of communication, which must
                                be in writing, is an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy securities that are the subject
                                of a registration statement. All FWPs must be filed with the SEC on the day of first use. A
                                WKSI can use an FWP whether or not the registration statement is filed.


             5. 5. 5. 4             Access Equals Delivery
                                     Offering rules acknowledge the widespread use of the internet and the use of electronic
                                communications by adopting an access equals delivery model for meeting prospectus delivery
                                obligations. A prospectus will be deemed to precede or accompany a security for sale if the
                                final prospectus has been filed with the SEC. To view the final prospectus, log on to the SEC’s
                                website.

                  5. 6              GUN JUMPING

                                             Jumping the gun relates to soliciting orders or conditioning the market for an upcoming
                                        offering before the effective date of the offering. Before the aforementioned securities offering
                                        reforms, the only acceptable communication before the effective date for an IPO was a red
                                        herring. For follow-on offerings, an issuer could take advantage of SEC rules 137-139.
                                             As the result of the reforms, there are now two additional safe harbors to protect issuers
                                        from a gun jumping violation. For follow-on offerings, SEC Rule 168 allows a reporting issuer
                                        to publish regularly released factual business and forward looking information at any time. For
                                        IPOs, SEC Rule 169 allows a non-reporting issuer to publish regularly released factual business
                                        information that is meant for general use; that is, outside of the scope of a potential investor.
                                             Factual business information includes information about the business or financial affairs of
                                        an issuer, information regarding an issuer’s products, and any information included in reports
                                        filed with the SEC.
                                             Forward looking information included earnings forecasts, future business plans, and state-
                                        ments about future business performance.

                                                        the financial community with information on a prospective public offering once the

                                                        a form of oral communication. Recorded road shows are considered to be a written

       5. 7             RESTRICTIONS ON SALES OF INITIAL EQUITY PUBLIC
                        OFFERINGS AND NEW ISSUE ALLOCATIONS


       5. 7. 1                  FINRA RULES 5130 AND 5131
                                    These rules are designed to protect the integrity of the public offering process by ensuring
                                that:
                                ■■ members make a bona fide public offering of securities at the public offering price;
                                ■■ members do not withhold securities in a public offering for their own benefit or use such
                                    securities to reward (or threaten) persons who are in a position to direct future business to
                                    the member; and
                                ■■ industry insiders, such as members and their associated persons, do not take advantage
                                    of their insider status to gain access to new issues for their own benefit at the expense of
                                    public customers.
                                    Rule 5130 only applies to a new issue, which is defined as any initial public offering of
                                equity securities. The rule does not apply to additional issue offerings, debt securities, restricted
                                or exempt securities, convertible securities, preferred stock, investment company securities, or
                                ADRs that have a preexisting market outside the U.S. Also excluded are REITs and DPPs.
                                Essentially, the rule applies to IPOs of common stock.


       5. 7. 2                  RESTRICTED PERSONS
                                    Rule 5130 prohibits member firms from selling a new issue to any account in which
                                restricted persons are beneficial owners. Restricted persons are defined as:
                                ■■ member firms;
                                ■■ employees of members;
                                ■■ finders and fiduciaries acting on behalf of the managing underwriter, including attorneys,
                                    accountants, and financial consultants;
                                ■■ portfolio managers, including any person who has the authority to buy or sell securities for
                                    a bank, savings and loan association, insurance company, investment adviser or collective
                                    investment account, investment corporation, venture capital funds, or any other vehicle
                                    engaged primarily in the purchase or sale of securities; and
                                ■■ any person owning 10% or more of a member firm.
                                    Any immediate family member of any previously mentioned person also is restricted.
                                Immediate family includes parents, in-laws, spouses, siblings, children, or any other individual
                                to whom the person provides material support.

                                            There is an exemption granted to employees of a limited business broker-dealer, which
                                        is defined as a firm engaged solely in the purchase and sale of investment company/variable
                                        contract securities, direct participation program securities, or both.

                                                        itself.



                  5. 7. 3               DE MINIMIS RULE
                                            If the beneficial interests of restricted persons do not exceed 10% of an account, the
                                        account may purchase a new equity issue. Restricted persons will be able to have an interest in
                                        an account that purchases new equity issues if no more than 10% of the account’s beneficial
                                        owners are restricted persons.


                  5. 7. 4               SPINNING
                                            Spinning is the practice of allocating highly sought-after IPO shares (also known as hot
                                        stock) to individuals who are in a position to direct securities business to the firm. This is why
                                        portfolio managers are categorized as restricted persons. These individuals are in a position to
                                        direct business to a firm and may be willing to do so based on the size of their allocation.
                                            Rule 5131 prohibits spinning. An executive officer or director has a beneficial interest in
                                        the company and is subject to the following prohibitions:
                                        ■■ If the company is currently an investment banking services client of the member or the
                                            member has received compensation from the company for investment banking services in
                                            the past 12 months
                                        ■■ If the person responsible for making the allocation decision knows, or has reason to know,
                                            that the member intends to provide, or expects to be retained by the company for invest-
                                            ment banking services within the next three months
                                        ■■ On the express or implied condition that such executive officer or director, on behalf of
                                            the company, will retain the member for the performance of future investment banking
                                            services

                                            This rule does not apply to allocations directed in writing by the issuer or selling share-
                                        holders, provided that the member firm has no involvement, directly or indirectly, in the
                                        allocation process.

       5. 7. 5                  QUID PRO QUO ALLOCATIONS
                                    Furthermore, Rule 5131 prohibits members from threatening to withhold shares they allo-
                                cate of a new issue as an inducement to compensate them excessively in relation to the ser-
                                vices provided by the member.


       5. 7. 6                  FLIPPING
                                     Flipping refers to the sale of new issue shares, such as a hot stock, purchased within 30 days
                                following the offering date. Rule 5131 prohibits members or APs from directly or indirectly
                                attempting to recoup a commission or credit paid or awarded to an AP for selling shares of a
                                hot stock that are then flipped by a customer, unless the book runner has assessed a penalty bid
                                on the entire syndicate. The rule also requires that members record and maintain information
                                regarding any penalties or disincentives assessed or its associated persons in connection with
                                a penalty bid in addition to their existing requirements to maintain records with respect to
                                penalty bids.


       5. 7. 7                  CARVE-OUT PROCEDURES
                                     Under the de minimis provision in the rule, a restricted person (such as a hedge fund man-
                                ager) may indirectly participate in new equity issues through a collective investment account
                                if their beneficial interest does not exceed 10% of the fund’s equity. To address this, FINRA
                                allows hedge funds, where restricted persons own more than 10% of the shares, to buy new
                                equity issues of the fund to segregate the interests of restricted and nonrestricted persons, and
                                to direct the profit from a new issue investment so that restricted persons receive a benefit not
                                to exceed 10% of their actual percent ownership of the fund.




                     *
                    EXAMPLE                           If 30% of a hedge fund’s partners are restricted persons and that fund buys
                                                 10,000 shares of a new equity issue, no more than 1,000 shares may be attributed
                                                 in the aggregate to those restricted partners’ accounts. In contrast, if 7% of a hedge
                                                 fund’s partners are restricted persons, no more than 700 shares may be attributed
                                                 in the aggregate to those restricted partners’ accounts. Hedge fund managers are
                                                 required to represent to the member firms through which they purchase new issues,
                                                 that the account is in compliance with the rule. They must determine the eligibility
                                                 status of their shareholders on an annual basis, as representations can be more than

       5. 7. 8                  REPRESENTATIONS
                                    Under Rule 5130, prior to selling a new equity issue to an account, a member must obtain
                                a representation from the account owner (or a person authorized to represent the account
                                holder) that the account is eligible to purchase a new equity issue at the POP. If an interest is
                                held by a bank, investment adviser, or other conduit, prior to selling the new issue, a member
                                must obtain a representation from the conduit that all purchasers are in compliance with the

                                        period prior to the sale of the new issue.
                                            All records relating to whether an account is eligible to purchase new equity issues must

                                        with FINRA with respect to an initial offering of equity securities:
                                        ■■ The initial list of syndicate members, their underwriting commitment, and retention
                                            amounts on or before the offering date (the retention amount in this context means the
                                            percentage of offered securities allotted to syndicate members after setting aside a portion
                                            of the issue for sales to institutions and selling group members); and

                                        appears that the issue is not selling well, the syndicate manager may allow sales to standby

                                            Securities purchased pursuant to a standby arrangement are not subject to FINRA Rule

       5. 7. 11 ISSUER-DIRECTED SALES
                                    The prohibitions of FINRA Rule 5130 on the purchase of new equity issues do not apply
                                to securities that are specifically directed by the issuer to certain restricted persons. However,
                                issuer-directed sales may not be made to members, to an account in which any employee of a
                                member firm has a beneficial interest, or to an account in which finders or fiduciaries have an
                                interest. Naturally, there is an exception: if this person or a member of his immediate family is
                                an employee of the issuer, then IPO sales can be made to this account.
                                    Also, if an issuer is engaged in a nonunderwritten offering, the issuer may direct sales to a
                                member firm. This makes sense, because there are no members involved in the underwriting.


       5. 7. 12 TIE-IN ARRANGEMENTS
                                    A tie-in arrangement is one in which a member firm, in return for letting a customer buy
                                shares of a new issue at the POP, requires the customer to buy a certain number of shares in
                                the secondary market. This type of arrangement is fraud under the Securities Exchange Act of
                                1934 and is strictly prohibited.
                                    Another type of tie-in arrangement occurs when banks, which are members, attempt to tie
                                commercial loans made to broker-dealers and others to investment banking services provided
                                by the banks. It is a violation of federal banking law and FINRA rules for a bank to extend
                                credit on the condition that the borrower engages in some other business with the bank.

                    EXAMPLE                          Examples of violations include providing bridge loans in which the loan is to be
                                                 repaid out of the proceeds of a bond offering managed by the bank and providing
                                                 federally insured bridge loans to support a merger or acquisition managed by the
                                                 bank.



       5. 7. 13 “REDUCED PRICING” PROHIBITION
                                    Syndicate and selling group members are prohibited from offering anyone (other than the
                                members) a discount from the public offering price. This requirement applies until the offer-
                                ing is terminated or, after having made a bona fide attempt to sell the fixed price securities at
                                the public offering price, the syndicate/group is unable to continue selling of the securities at
                                the POP.

                                                 to buy a new issue, members can pay no more than fair market price for the securities

                           OF INTEREST (FINRA RULE 5121)
                                      If a member offers its shares to the public, customer checks subscribing to the new issue
                                 must be placed in an escrow account. On completion of the offering, the member must imme-
                                 diately do a net capital computation and provide a copy to FINRA.
                                      If its computed capital is less than 120% of minimum, or its AI-to-NC ratio exceeds 10:1,
                                 the offering must be canceled and the monies returned to the new issue purchasers. The mem-
                                 ber can use the net proceeds of the offering in performing the computation. As a side note, no
                                 member may sell its own stock into a discretionary account when a conflict exists. With a self
                                 underwriting, there is a built-in conflict of interest. It’s not illegal to have a conflict of inter-
                                 est; however, the broker-dealer must have received specific written approval of the transaction
                                 from the account holder and must retain documentation of the approval in its records.

                                to affect the offering price of the security prior to the effective date. To address this situation,
                                the SEC created a three-tiered definition of a security based on trading volume and public
                                float value. These definitions, as well as restrictions placed on market makers and syndicate
                                members, are described in Rule 101.

                                                      The following is an example of a covered security for purposes of Regulation M.
                                                 A distribution of notes that are convertible into common stock, the convertible notes
                                                 are the “subject security,” the common stock is the “reference security,” and both the
                                                 convertible notes and the common stock are “covered securities.”



       5. 8. 1                  REGULATION M RULE 101
                                    If a security meets the definition of an actively traded security (tier 1), there are no restric-
                                tions placed on market makers or syndicate members prior to the effective date. An actively
                                traded security is one with an average daily trading volume (ADTV) value of at least $1 mil-
                                lion and a public float value of $150 million or more.
                                    Securities with an ADTV of at least $100,000 and a public float value of $25 million or
                                more (tier 2) are subject to a restricted period of one day—the business day before the effec-
                                tive date.
                                    Securities that do not meet the criteria previously outlined are tier 3 securities and are
                                subject to a restricted period of five days—the five business days before the effective date.
                                    As noted, there is no restricted period for actively traded securities. The SEC believes it
                                would be difficult for market makers and syndicate members to manipulate the market prior to
                                the effective date, given the trading characteristics of these securities.


       5. 8. 2                  REGULATION M RULE 102
                                    If there is a restricted period, the issuer and its affiliates (including officers and selling
                                shareholders, if any) cannot bid for or purchase the security during this period.



       5. 8. 3                  REGULATION M RULE 103
                                   If a market maker who also is a syndicate member elects to function as a passive market
                                maker during the restricted period, the following rules apply.
                                ■■ Notification must be made to Nasdaq one business day in advance of the restricted period.
                                ■■ Quotes over Nasdaq must be identified as those of a passive market maker (PSMM is the
                                   Nasdaq modifier).
                                ■■ Passive bids can be no higher than the highest independent bid, which is a bid made by a
                                   market maker not involved in the underwriting.

                                                             There is one circumstance in which a passive bid can be higher than the highest
                                                        independent bid. If a passive market maker receives a customer limit order to buy at a
                                                        price higher than the higher independent bid, that limit order must be displayed.

                                            Passive market makers also are subject to daily net purchase limitations (number of shares
                                        bought less number of shares sold). The limit is 30% of that market maker’s average daily trad-
                                        ing volume in the stock. Once a passive market maker reaches or exceeds the net purchase
                                        limit, the firm must seek an excused withdrawal for the remainder of the trading day.

                                 EXAMPLE                     A market maker (who also is a syndicate member) has an average daily trading
                                                        volume of 20,000 shares in the subject security. Its daily net purchase limit would be
                                                        6,000 shares. During the restricted period, its net purchases total 5,800 shares. At
                                                        that point, it could accept a customer sell order for 200 shares, which would put it at
                                                        the limit (6,000 shares), requiring an excused withdrawal. Or, at that point, it could
                                                        accept a customer sell order for 600 shares, which would put it over the limit (6,400),
                                                        again requiring an excused withdrawal.

                                            Information on average daily trading volume on the stock to be underwritten, as well as
                                        the average daily trading volume of each market maker in the stock, is supplied to the syn-
                                        dicate manager by FINRA. Passive market making can only be done in fixed price offerings
                                        underwritten on a firm commitment basis and is only permitted if an independent market
                                        exists for the stock.
                                            An independent market exists if there is at least one market maker in the stock not
                                        involved in the underwriting.

                            !                         Testable points regarding Rule 103 of Regulation M include the following.
                                                      ■■ Application for passive market making activity must be made one business
                                                         day before the restricted period.

                                                      ■■ Passive market making activity can occur only if an independent market
                                                         exists.

                                                      ■■ Passive market making activity can occur only in firm commitment
                                                         underwritings.

                                                      ■■ Passive market makers are subject to the limit order display rule.

                                                      ■■ Actively traded securities (ADTV value of $1 million and a public float of
                                                         $150 million or more) are not subject to passive market making.



       5. 8. 4                  REGULATION M RULE 104
                                    While many new issues trade at a premium to the offering price in the secondary market,
                                there are some that trade below the offering price, creating serious problems for the syndicate.




                     *
                    EXAMPLE                           If a new offering is offered at $20 per share and, once effective, is bid at $19.25
                                                 in the secondary market, customers who agreed to buy at the offering price may walk
                                                 away, convinced the underwriters overpriced the deal.

                                    Stabilization is permitted to ensure an orderly distribution. One member of the syndicate,
                                generally the manager, is permitted to place a stabilizing bid over Nasdaq. With a stabilizing
                                bid in place, it is unlikely that the price of the new issue will fall below the stabilizing bid, at
                                least for the short term.
                                    The basic rules on stabilization are as follows.
                                ■■ Stabilization is only permitted for fixed-price offerings underwritten on a firm commit-
                                    ment basis; thus, at-the-market offerings can never be stabilized.
                                ■■ To place a stabilizing bid, an independent market must exist.
                                ■■ Notice of stabilization must appear in the prospectus.
                                ■■ Only one stabilizing bid is permitted. In addition, a stabilizing bid always is placed as a
                                    one-sided market and must be identified as such over Nasdaq.
                                ■■ Stabilizing bids are placed at or below the public offering price but never above. A stabiliz-
                                    ing bid can never be higher than the highest independent bid in the primary listing market
                                    for the security.
                                ■■ Stabilizing bids can be lowered or raised but never above either the public offering price
                                    or the highest independent bid.

                                    In additional issue offerings, members are permitted to place a pre-effective stabilizing bid.
                                The manager must notify Nasdaq of its intention and indicate whether the pre-effective bid
                                will be converted to a conventional bid once the offering is effective.




Series_24_9e_Rev_LEM.indb 370                                                                                                               5/27/2015 7:38:50 AM

                                            Before placing a one-sided stabilizing bid, the manager must notify Nasdaq of its intention
                                        to place the bid and provide the following to Nasdaq:
                                        ■■ Whether the bid will be a penalty bid (PBID) or a penalty-free bid (SYND)
                                        ■■ A copy of the cover page of the prospectus
                                        ■■ Whether the syndicate will engage in any short covering

                                            A penalty bid is one in which the manager can reclaim the underwriting fee and/or the
                                        concession received by a member of the underwriting group if too many customers of that
                                        member quickly sell the stock at the stabilizing bid.
                                            If the stabilizing bid doesn’t deter negative market reaction to a new issue, the manager
                                        can release members of the syndicate and selling group from their commitment to sell at the
                                        public offering price. The manager does this by lowering the offering price. This action, of
                                        course, would eliminate any profit to be made on the underwriting.

                        5. 8. 4. 1          Time Limits
                                            Although penalty bids are generally lifted within 30 days, and the green shoe overallot-
                                        ment option is also generally exercised during the first 30 days, Rule 104 places no time limit
                                        on how long price support activities may last. However, Uniform Practice Rules of FINRA
                                        require that final settlement of corporate syndicate accounts be made within 90 days following
                                        the date the issuer delivers the securities to the syndicate. Because stabilization is prohibited
                                        once the syndicate disbands, there is a de facto limit of 90 days.

                        5. 8. 4. 2          Records
                                            Records relating to stabilization activities must be retained by the syndicate manager for
                                        three years. If a syndicate member other than the manager places the stabilizing bid, that syn-
                                        dicate member must provide stabilization information to the manager within three business
                                        days of commencement of stabilization, and daily thereafter.


                  5. 8. 5               REGULATION M RULE 105
                                            SEC Rule 105 limits short selling prior to the effective date of an additional issue offering.
                                        Before this rule took effect, it was possible for investors, prior to the effective date, to short the
                                        stock, driving down the price. This would in turn force the manager to lower the public offer-
                                        ing price. The short sellers would then buy at the offering price, covering the short position
                                        and making some money for themselves.
                                            Rule 105 prohibits purchases at the offering price to cover short positions established
                                        within five business days of the effective date.

                                    Certain new issues of securities are exempt from the registration requirements of the
                                Securities Act of 1933. An exempt security is any security exempt by law from having to
                                register with the SEC prior to public sale.

                        5. 9. 2. 1   SEC Regulation A+
                                     With the passage of the JOBS Act, a new capital formation scheme for small- and medium-
                                 sized firms was called for to ease the red tape associated with IPOs. Although Regulation A
                                 was an alternative to a full IPO, it was never fully used—chiefly because it was limited to only
                                 $5 million and the offering needed to be registered in each and every state the securities were
                                 being sold—a very expensive and time consuming process. State administrators also judge the
                                 merits of an offering, in some cases prohibiting the sale of securities it deems too risky, such as
                                 what happened to Apple Computers in Massachusetts in 1980. All of this added up to making
                                 Regulation A unworkable.
                                     On March 25, 2015, the SEC approved Regulation A+. It became effective on June 19,
                                 2015. This new regulation provides for two offering tiers.
                                 ■■ Tier 1—securities offerings up to $20 million in a 12-month period, including no more
                                     than $6 million sold on behalf of selling shareholders. Subject to a coordinated review by
                                     states and the SEC.
                                 ■■ Tier 2—securities offerings up to $50 million in a 12-month period, including no more
                                     than $15 million of securities sold on behalf of selling shareholders. The $50 million limit
                                     is subject to a periodic review by the Commission.

                                     Tier 2 permits a kind of mini-IPO allowing small, emerging companies to forego venture
                                 capital and raise substantial capital that is subject only to SEC scrutiny, preempting the bur-
                                 den of state regulation. New and innovative companies can look to nonaccredited investors
                                 such as their customers, employees, or even the general public for substantive financing with
                                 only a fraction of the regulatory burdens formerly seen. That said, Regulation A+ Tier 2 offer-
                                 ings are still subject to rigorous disclosure requirements to the SEC, similar to an S-1 review,
                                 including audited financial statements and annual, semiannual, and current reports. Tier 2s
                                 are not available to what the SEC calls certain “bad actors.”
                                     These Regulation A+ offering statements and disclosures must be filed on EDGAR in the
                                 same fashion as we previous read about S-1 registrations for IPOs. Tier 2 issuers are required to
                                 concurrently file a short-form Form 8-A to register a class of securities under Exchange Act.
                                 This is very desirable because it allows a Tier 2 issuer, if it chooses to do so, to list on a national
                                 securities exchange.
                                     Highlights of Regulation A+ Exemption include the following.
                                 ■■ General public solicitation is permitted on television, social media, etc.
                                 ■■ In a 12-month period, issuers may raise up to $20 million for Tier 1 and $50, million for
                                     Tier 2.
                                 ■■ Tier 2 offerings are open to the public, not limited to “accredited investors.” Tier 2 inves-
                                     tors must be “qualified” investors. There are two ways to qualify.
                                     —— Be an accredited investor as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D.
                                    —— Limit the investment to a maximum of the greater of 10% of their net worth or 10% of
                                        their net income per offering. Tier 1 has no investment limits.
                                 ■■ Investors may self-certify their income or net worth. No burdensome documentation is
                                    required to prove income or net worth.
                                 ■■ Must file a disclosure document and audited financials with the SEC and await approval
                                    from the SEC. The Offering Circular will receive the same level of scrutiny as a Form S-1
                                    in an IPO.

                                ■■ Tier 2 issuers are required to provide two years (or such shorter time as the issuer has been
                                   in existence) of audited financial statements. Tier 1 offerings require reviewed financials,
                                   not audited.
                                ■■ Tier 2 issuers are required to make an annual disclosure filing, a semiannual report, and
                                   current reports (similar to Form 10-K, Form 10-Q, and Form 8-K), which can be termi-
                                   nated after the first year if the shareholder count drops below 300. There is no ongoing
                                   disclosure requirement for Tier 1.
                                ■■ Tier 2 preempts state law. Tier 1 offerings remain subject to state regulation.
                                ■■ There are no shareholder limits.
                                ■■ Securities issued in a Reg A+ offering are unrestricted and freely transferable. However,
                                   issuers may choose to impose transfer restrictions on certain shareholders.
                                ■■ Investment companies (i.e., private equity funds, venture funds, hedge funds) may not use
                                   Reg A+ to raise capital.


             5. 9. 2. 2             Rule 147 Offerings
                                    To qualify for an intrastate offering exemption, a corporate issuer must be incorporated
                                in that state. In the case of a partnership, the principal place of business must be within that
                                state. To determine residency, the issuer, in addition to being incorporated or having its prin-
                                cipal office in the state, must meet the following 80% tests.
                                ■■ At least 80% of the issuer’s assets must be located in that state.
                                ■■ At least 80% of the issuer’s revenue must be generated in that state.
                                ■■ At least 80% of the proceeds of the offering must be deployed in that state (an issuer can-
                                    not use a 147 exemption to expand out of state).

                                    To qualify, the issuer files Form 147 with the SEC at least 10 business days prior to the
                                effective date of the offering. Member firms underwriting the issue must ensure that all persons
                                to whom offers or sales are made are residents of that state.

                                                      A single offer or sale to a nonresident destroys the exemption.




                                   Other limitations include the following.
                                ■■ All shares being offered must be primary shares. Sales by affiliates are not permitted.
                                ■■ Once the offering is complete, secondary market trading is limited to residents of that
                                   state; this resale restriction to nonresidents lasts for nine months from completion of the
                                   offering.


             5. 9. 2. 3             Regulation D Offerings
                                    Under the Securities Act of 1933, non-exempt securities offered to investors must either
                                be registered with the SEC or conform to an exemption provided by rules in Regulation D of
                                the act.

                                    A private placement involves the sale of unregistered securities by either a publicly traded
                                (SEC-reporting) company or, more obviously, a privately held company. A company seeking
                                to raise capital through a private placement under Rule 506(b) can be sold without regard to
                                dollar size to an unlimited number of accredited investors and up to 35 nonaccredited inves-
                                tors. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act prohibits felons and
                                other bad actors from relying on a Rule 506 safe harbor.
                                    An accredited investor is defined as a(n):
                                ■■ institution, such as an investment company, corporation, bank, or pension fund;
                                ■■ individual with annual income of $200,000 or more in each of the two most recent years
                                    with a reasonable expectation of similar earnings in the current year;
                                ■■ spouse with annual income of $300,000 or more in each of the two most recent years with
                                    a reasonable expectation of similar earnings in the current year;
                                ■■ individual or joint account with a net worth of $1 million or more exclusive of the equity
                                    in the primary residence; or
                                ■■ officer or director of the issuer, the company whose shares are being sold privately.

                                     A nonaccredited investor is one who does not meet these definitions. The SEC has stated
                                that while nonaccredited, these investors must be sophisticated and allowed the right to use a
                                purchaser representative to help evaluate the merits and risks of the proposed investment. A
                                purchaser representative could be a tax adviser, accountant, or the like. Because of the conflict
                                of interest, most firms prohibit registered representatives from acting as purchaser representa-
                                tives, though there is no rule prohibiting this.
                                     In counting the number of nonaccredited investors, the following rules apply.
                                ■■ A corporation, partnership, or other entity is counted as one purchaser. If, however, the
                                     entity was organized for the purpose of acquiring the securities, each owner will be counted
                                     separately.
                                ■■ Any relative or a spouse of a purchaser who has the same principal address as the purchaser
                                     is excluded from the count (if husband and wife each purchase units of a private place-
                                     ment, they count as one purchaser).
                                ■■ Any trust, estate, or corporation in which a purchaser or relative/spouse has more than a
                                     50% interest is excluded from the count (if a purchaser and a trust that he controls each
                                     purchase units, they will be counted as one purchaser).

                                    Regulation D states that purchaser representatives cannot be affiliated in any way with
                                the issuer. An exception is granted if the purchaser representative, though affiliated with the
                                issuer, is a relative of the investor by blood, marriage, or adoption.
                                    All prospective investors must receive a copy of the offering circular (known as the private
                                placement memorandum) within a reasonable period prior to confirmation of sale. All inves-
                                tors must sign an investment letter attesting to their understanding of the risks being assumed.
                                The amount of disclosure required in the offering circular depends on the dollar amount of the
                                private placement. The greater the amount, the greater the disclosure:
                                ■■ Rule 505. Private placement where an issuer can only offer and sell up to $5 million of its
                                    securities in any 12-month period
                                ■■ May sell to an unlimited number of “accredited investors” and up to 35 other persons who
                                    do not need to satisfy the sophistication or wealth standards associated with other exemp-

                                ■■ Must inform purchasers that they receive “restricted” securities, meaning that the securi-
                                    ties cannot be sold for six months or longer without registering them

                                ■■ Cannot use general solicitation or advertising to sell the securities
                                ■■ Rule 506. Private placement where there is no limit on the amount sold

                                    Since the adoption of Regulation D, the SEC took the view that general solicitation
                                and advertising be prohibited in order to take advantage of the safe harbor provided under
                                Rule 506—the member firm soliciting investors would have to have a preexisting relationship
                                with all persons solicited. No cold calling to generate interest was allowed. This put smaller
                                issuers and member firms (with fewer qualified investors) at a disadvantage to larger member
                                firms in competing for Regulation D work.
                                    This view still holds; however, new Rule 506(c) permits general solicitation in
                                Regulation D private placements if certain flexible conditions are satisfied, such as:
                                ■■ all purchasers are accredited investors, or the issuer reasonably believes they are at the
                                    time of the sale; and
                                ■■ the issuer is under an affirmative obligation to take reasonable steps to verify that purchas-
                                    ers are accredited investors.

                                   New Rule 506(c) also permits private investment funds (pooled investments) to solicit
                                generally, as well, so long as they point their sales efforts at “qualified purchasers” as defined
                                under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

                                                      A qualified investor under the Investment Company Act of 1940 is a natural
                                                 person who owns at least $5 million in investments or any entity acting for its own
                                                 account, or that of other qualified investors who own and invest on a discretionary
                                                 basis at least $25 million in investments.

                                    This new rule does not supersede the older rule. If the conditions of Rule 506(c) cannot
                                be satisfied, or the issuer chooses not to use general solicitation or advertising, the standard
                                safe harbor rules apply.
                                    A Rule 504 offering, which is distinct from most of the Regulation D rules, involves the
                                offering of securities in which the dollar amount does not exceed $1 million. It is distinct from
                                Rule 505 and 506 in that:
                                ■■ there are no limitations on the number of purchasers, accredited or nonaccredited;
                                ■■ there is no requirement that purchasers meet suitability or sophistication standards;
                                ■■ there are no restrictions on solicitation or advertising;
                                ■■ it can be used by an issuer to make a public offering of its securities; and
                                ■■ there are no restrictions as to resale.

                                    Rule 504 offerings are not available for blank check companies (entities without a defined
                                business or business plan).
                                    Rule 508 permits equity offerings through online crowdfunding portals. Small businesses
                                may seek up to $1 million per year from small investors through a crowdfunding portal that
                                must be registered with the SEC and FINRA. Advertising is permitted. Crowdfunding rules
                                are evolving.

                                            Rule 5122 requires that a member firm offering its own securities in a private placement,

                                        submitted to the department within 10 calendar days of being provided to an investor or pro-
                                        spective investor. If there are no offering documents, the firm must indicate that. Firms are
                                        required to file electronically through the FINRA Firm Gateway.
                                            Unit 1 provided information about Firm Gateway and becoming a member. Understand
                                        that the Gateway supplies FINRA with many different types of information. Other than pri-

                                        5. 9. 2. 3. 2 Private Placements Filing Requirements
                                            FINRA Rule 5123 requires each member firm that sells a security in a non-public offer-
                                        ing to submit to FINRA a copy of any private placement memorandum, term sheet, or other
                                        offering document, including any material revisions, used in connection with the sale within
                                        15 calendar days of the date of first sale. Alternatively, if there are no offering documents, the
                                        member firm must notify FINRA that no such offering documents were used. The required
                                        documents or notification must be made electronically in searchable PDF using a newly devel-
                                        oped private placement filing system through the FINRA Firm Gateway. When a member
                                        firm makes a notice filing, there will be no response from FINRA (i.e., no comment letter or
                                        clearance letter). An example of a notice filing with which you might be more familiar is Form

                                     The SEC permits investors to view private placement memoranda on the internet if the
                                following conditions are met.
                                ■■ A member must prequalify investors by having them complete an online questionnaire to
                                     determine whether they are accredited or sophisticated.
                                ■■ Once qualified, investors can view offering documents on a password-protected page. This
                                     page is available to investors only after a member has determined that they are accredited
                                     or sophisticated.

                                   The SEC takes the view that the qualification of accredited and sophisticated investors by
                                completing a questionnaire and posting a notice of private offerings on a password-protected
                                page would not involve any form of general solicitation or advertising.

                            !                        One popular use of Regulation D is through a PIPE (Private Investment in Public
                                                 Equity) transaction. In a PIPE, investors purchase securities directly from a publicly
                                                 traded issuer in a private placement. The securities purchased are restricted and can-
                                                 not be immediately resold. After the closing of the transaction, the issuer immediately
                                                 prepares and files a registration statement with the SEC for the securities issued in the
                                                 PIPE. Once the registration is effective, public resale of the PIPE securities may begin.

                                   This rule exempts certain types of corporate reorganizations from having to register shares
                                under the Securities Act of 1933. The basic exemptions include:
                                ■■ a stock split;
                                ■■ a stock dividend; and
                                ■■ a change in par value of existing shares.

                                    If an issuer were required to register the additional shares resulting from a stock split or
                                stock dividend, these events would not occur.
                                    Certain reorganizations do require registration. These include:
                                ■■ a merger in which the surviving company issues additional shares to acquire the shares of

       5. 10            SEC RULE 144


       5. 10. 1 RULE 144—SELLING RESTRICTED AND CONTROL
                SECURITIES
                                     Rule 144 regulates the sale of both control and restricted securities. Control securities are those
                                owned by people who are affiliated with the issuer, such as directors, officers, a spouse of an
                                officer, or persons who own more than 10% of a company’s outstanding securities. Such per-
                                sons are subject to volume limitations on the sale of these securities for if they are affiliated
                                with the company.
                                     Unless it is unregistered, such as privately placed stock, control stock is not subject to
                                the holding period requirements imposed on restricted stock but is subject to volume limits
                                throughout the time the owner holds the control position.

                                                     If an unaffiliated individual owns 7% of the voting stock of XYZ, that person is
                                                 not a control person. However, if that person’s spouse owns 5% of the voting stock,
                                                 then both would be considered control persons. In other words, if there is a greater
                                                 than 10% interest held by immediate family members, then all those family members
                                                 owning voting stock are control persons.

                                    Restricted securities are those acquired through a Regulation D private placement or any
                                means other than a registered public offering. Restricted securities may not be sold until they
                                have been held fully paid for a minimum of six months. According to Rule 144, after holding
                                restricted stock fully paid for six months, an affiliate may begin selling shares but is subject to
                                the volume restriction rules in the following list. Furthermore, restricted stock is not subject
                                to the 10-second reporting requirement (see reporting requirements in Unit 4). In any 90-day
                                period, an investor may sell the greater of:
                                ■■ 1% of the total outstanding shares of the same class at the time of sale; or
                                ■■ the average weekly trading volume in the stock over the past four weeks on all exchanges
                                    or as reported through Nasdaq.

                                    After the six-month holding period, affiliated persons remain subject to the volume
                                restrictions for as long as they are affiliates. For unaffiliated investors, the stock may be sold
                                completely unrestricted after the six-month holding period has been satisfied.
                                    Selling shares under Rule 144 effectively registers the shares. In other words, buyers of
                                stock being sold subject to Rule 144 are not subject to any restrictions if they choose to resell.

                            !                         When you encounter a Rule 144 question, look for the following two things.

                                                     Only restricted stock has a holding period. Unless unregistered, control stock can
                                                 be sold immediately, but volume limits always apply.

                                                      Only restricted stock has a holding period. Control stock, unless it is restricted
                                                 due to it being acquired in a private placement, can be sold immediately; but volume

                                                     Which of the following is subject to the holding period provisions of Rule 144?
                                                      A. A corporate insider who has held restricted stock for 2 years.
                                                      B. A nonaffiliate who has held registered stock for 3 years.
                                                      C. A nonaffiliate who has held control stock for 6 months.
                                                      D. A nonaffiliate who has held restricted stock for 3 months.
                                                     Answer: D. Only restricted stock obtained as part of a private placement is
                                                 subject to the 6-month holding period for both affiliates and nonaffiliate; registered
                                                 shares are not and control stock is not. The nonaffiliate in choice D, who has held the
                                                 shares for only 3 months, will still be subject to the holding period until the 6-month
                                                 requirement is met.

                                    When required, Form 144 must be filed no later than concurrently with the sale of the
                                stock, and the filing is good for 90 days. If the intended sale during any 90-day period for
                                an affiliate is small, the filing requirement is waived. This is known as the de minimis filing
                                threshold for affiliates. Sales in amounts not exceeding 5,000 shares or $50,000 in sale proceeds
                                are permitted without filing Form 144.
                                    As previously mentioned, a nonaffiliated seller may sell privately placed securities to the
                                public in unlimited amounts and without filing Form 144. However, following the six-month
                                holding period and continuing for an additional six months, the seller must comply with the
                                requirement that there be available adequate, current, public information about the issuer.

                                This can be accomplished by verifying that the company is a reporting company that regularly
                                files 10K and 10Q reports with the SEC.
                                     Insiders defined under Rule 144 are not allowed to enter short sales in the securities of
                                companies in which they are insiders. They also are restricted from participating in specula-
                                tive options transactions. If an insider profits from the sale of securities held for less than six
                                months, these short-swing profits are required to be disgorged (returned) to the company.
                                Report any trading of insider-owned securities to the SEC within two business days of the
                                transaction.

                                    The SEC restricts broker-dealers from actively soliciting buyers for control shares or for
                                arranging private negotiations between buyers and sellers of control stock. Additionally, all
                                sales under Rule 144 are to be executed as agency transactions, meaning that the firm matches
                                a buyer and seller.
                                    Buyers of 144 stock must come to firms on an unsolicited basis. Initiating contact with cus-
                                tomers or other broker-dealers for the purpose of selling the stock is prohibited, but callbacks are
                                allowed under the following circumstances.
                                ■■ Customer callbacks may be made to customers who expressed interest in the stock within
                                    the past 10 business days.
                                ■■ Broker-dealer callbacks may be made to those firms that expressed interest within the past
                                    60 calendar days.

                                     Broker-dealers may not register as market makers in anticipation of Rule 144 transactions.
                                If a firm is currently registered as a market maker in the stock, the firm can purchase for its
                                inventory. This is an exception from the rule that firms may act in an agent capacity only in
                                Rule 144 transactions.
                                     A firm may purchase as dealer under one additional exception. Block positioners are firms
                                defined under SEC Rule 3b-8 as firms that purchase long or sell short blocks of stock worth
                                $200,000 or more. These firms may be treated as market makers for Rule 144 transactions.



           TEST TOPIC ALERT
                            !                         Review the following points regarding Rule 144.
                                                      ■■ Restricted stock has a six-month holding period unless the holder is the
                                                         estate of a deceased person.

                                                      ■■ Restricted stock held by an estate is exempt from both the holding period
                                                         requirements and the volume limitations of Rule 144.

                                                      ■■ There is no holding period on registered control stock, but volume limits
                                                         always apply.

                                                      ■■ Rule 144 transactions should be agency-only unless the firm is a registered
                                                         market maker or block positioner in the stock.

                                                      ■■ Callbacks are allowed to customers who indicated interest within the past 10
                                                         business days and to firms that indicated interest within the past 60 calendar
                                                         days.

                                                            Insiders cannot short. They are prohibited from taking short-swing profits and
                                                        cannot engage in short naked options positions or short sales.
                                                            Insiders are permitted, however, to write calls against a long stock position. On
                                                        the other hand, a corporation cannot write calls against its own stock; for example,
                                                        stock held in its treasury. If exercised, the company must deliver shares, thereby in-
                                                        creasing the number of shares outstanding. This would require shareholder approval.



                  5. 10. 2 RULE 144A
                                             An issuer of debt or equity securities that wishes to rely upon an exemption from the sig-
                                        nificant burdens of registration with the SEC under the Securities Act of 1933 often selects
                                        Regulation D, or Regulation S for those issuers raising capital outside the United States. In
                                        either case, it’s important that those investors who purchase securities under those regulations
                                        do not fall into the definition of an underwriter and be deemed to be making a distribution.
                                        Rule 144A provides a safe harbor for those investors known as qualified institution buyers
                                        (QIBs). Rule 144A allows nonregistered foreign and domestic securities to be traded among
                                        QIBs in the United States without holding period requirements.


                  5. 10. 3 144A TRADES BY QIBS REPORT THROUGH ORF
                                            Rule 144A provides an exemption for secondary market trading of unregistered securities
                                        among QIBs. A QIB is an institution (pension fund, investment company, insurance company,
                                        and so forth) with a securities portfolio valued at $100 million or more. Member firms are con-
                                        sidered QIBs if they have a securities portfolio valued at a less restrictive $10 million or more.
                                        QIBs cannot be individuals, no matter how wealthy they may be.
                                            QIBs can trade unregistered securities with each other without concern for a holding
                                        period and volume restrictions. Rule 144A provides a limited exemption for secondary market
                                        trading of unregistered securities among QIBs only.
                                            Ordinarily, trades in NMS and OTC equity securities must be reported within 10 seconds;
                                        but last sale reports in restricted equity securities are made to FINRA’s OTC Reporting Facility
                                        (ORF) by participants on the same business day. Failure to report in a timely manner will have
                                        to report on an as/of basis to denote execution on a prior day with the appropriate modifier.
                                        For more information, see Trade Report Rules in Unit 4. Participants to the ORF must obtain
                                        from the system a unique Market Participant Symbol (MPID) and use that identifier for all
                                        trade reporting. Eligible 144A debt securities are reported through TRACE.
                                            Rule 144A provides a liquid secondary market for securities issued in exempt offerings
                                        under Regulation D and Regulation S for those investors that meet the definition of a qualified
                                        institutional buyer (QIB).

                  5. 11          TENDER OFFERS AND CORPORATE BUY-BACKS


                  5. 11. 1 TENDER OFFERS BY ISSUERS (SELF TENDER)
                                        When an entity publicly announces its intention to acquire, in a tender offer, shares of a
                                    target company, the following rules apply.
                                    ■■ Once the tender is announced by filing for Schedule TO-I, the entity making the offer
                                        can no longer buy the target company’s share in the open market (Rule 10b-13). The only
                                        shares it can purchase are those tendered by shareholders.
                                    ■■ The entity making the offer is similarly prohibited from buying convertible securities or
                                        call options (equivalent securities) of the target company in the open market. It could,
                                        however, make open market purchases of other nonconvertible securities of the issuer.
                                    ■■ The tender offer, unless withdrawn, under Regulation 14E, must remain open for at least
                                        20 business days from the date the offer is first announced.
                                    ■■ If the terms of the offer are changed, the revised offer must remain open for at least 20
                                        business days from the commencement and 10 business days from the date the terms are
                                        changed.
                                        The target company, within 10 business days of the announcement, must provide its share-
                                    holders with a statement:
                                    ■■ accepting or rejecting the offer;
                                    ■■ expressing no opinion on the offer; or
                                    ■■ that it is unable to take a position on the offer.
                                       The statement must outline the reasons for the position taken.


                  5. 11. 2 SHORT TENDER RULE
                                        Shareholders of the target company are permitted to tender shares only to the extent of
                                    their net long position.




                                *

                                                   were permitted to tender the 400 shares in the cash account and the tender offer was
                                                   successful in acquiring all the outstanding shares, the customer would be short 100
                                                   shares with no way to cover.

                                       A customer is considered long a stock if the customer:

                                    ■■ owns a convertible security and has issued conversion instructions; or

                                                 options) can tender without first converting. They will only be required to convert if
                                                 their tender is accepted.

                                   If an investor has written calls against a long stock position and the tender offer price
                                exceeds the exercise price of the calls, then the investor can only tender those shares that
                                remain uncovered.



           TEST TOPIC ALERT
                            !                       An investor is long 300 shares of ABCD in a cash account and short 300 shares of
                                                 ABCD in a margin account. A tender offer for ABCD is announced. How many shares
                                                 may be tendered by the investor?
                                                      Only the investor’s net long position may be tendered. The investor’s long posi-
                                                 tion of 300 shares is fully offset by the short position of 300 shares. No shares can be

       5. 11. 3 ISSUER BUYING ITS OWN SECURITIES
                                   If an issuer wants to buy back its own stock in the open market, SEC Rule 10b-18 applies.
                                ■■ Transactions on any given day can only be effected through one market maker or desig-
                                   nated market makers (DMM).
                                ■■ Transactions on any given day cannot exceed 25% of the average daily trading volume
                                   measured over the prior four calendar weeks. Block purchases count against the daily pur-
                                   chase limit. There is an exception to this, however. It’s called the “one block per week
                                   exception.” As the name implies, issuers are permitted to make one block purchase of its
                                   common stock per week outside of the prescribed volume restrictions.
                                ■■ Transactions cannot affect the opening or closing of security. A safe harbor is available if
                                   the issuer is not involved in the first transaction of the day or any transaction in the last
                                   half hour of trading (3:30–4:00 pm ET).
                                ■■ Transactions can be executed at prices no higher than the highest independent bid or the
                                   last reported sale price, whichever is higher.

                                                      If an issuer’s security is an actively traded security as defined in Regulation M, the
                                                 safe harbor will not apply for the 10-minute period prior to market close. For other
                                                 issuers, the safe harbor will not be available for purchases effected within 30 minutes
                                                 of closing.
                                                      In other words, an issuer with an ADTV less than $1 million per day, or a public
                                                 float value below $150 million, is not permitted to make a trade in its stock within the
                                                 last 30 minutes of the normal trading day. Companies with higher average trading
                                                 volume or public float value may trade up until the last 10 minutes.

                                      To address concerns that the rule adversely affects issuers with low to moderate trading
                                  volume, the SEC allows issuers to make one block purchase of its stock each week without
                                  regard to the 25% volume limit if it makes no other 10b-18 purchases that day.

                                OF INTEREST


                  5. 12. 1 FINRA RULE 5121
                                     When a member firm, for example, wishes to go public, it must abide by FINRA Rule
                                  5121. In the initial public offering, the member, to avoid a clear conflict of interest, must
                                  engage an independent qualified underwriter to help it:
                                  ■■ perform due diligence; and
                                  ■■ prepare the registration statement and the prospectus.
                                     The securities must have a bona fide public market or be investment grade.
                                     FINRA Rule 5121 does not apply to the issuing member and its employees. These are
                                  considered issuer-directed sales.


                        5. 12. 1. 1 Independent Qualified Underwriter
                                      An independent qualified underwriter must have been a book-running manager of at least
                                  three public offerings of equity securities of which each must have been for not less than 50%
                                  of the anticipated gross proceeds of the proposed offering for at least the three-year period
                                  immediately preceding the filing of the registration statement.
                                      No person associated with the firm in a supervisory capacity with respect to public offer-
                                  ings may have been convicted, within the previous five years, of having violated the antifraud
                                  provisions of federal securities law.

                                      Suitability. In recommending the purchase of its employer’s stock to customers, regis-
                                  tered representatives of the member going public must ensure that all buyers are suitable.
                                  Records of each suitability determination must be maintained by the member for three years.

                                      Discretionary Accounts. With regard to discretionary accounts, registered representa-
                                  tives of the member going public cannot purchase shares for these accounts without first
                                  receiving the customer’s written permission.

                                      Affiliated Relationships. The requirement to use an independent qualified underwriter
                                  applies not only to initial public offerings of the member’s shares but also to initial public
                                  offerings where there is an affiliated relationship between issuer and member. An affiliation
                                  exists if there is a 10% or more ownership interest between the two.

                                    All proceeds from a public offering by a member firm of its own securities must be placed
                                in escrow. The member firm must then perform a net capital computation demonstrating the
                                net capital of the firm is no less than 120% of the minimum or that the AI:NC ratio is no
                                greater than 10:1. In performing the calculation, the proceeds from the offering may be taken
                                in consideration in calculating net capital.

                                                 wanted to go public, the member could not act as syndicate manager. The member
                                                 must engage an independent qualified underwriter.

       5. 13. 1 OFFERINGS SUBJECT TO RULE 5110
                                    The Corporate Financing Department (CFD), established by the Board of Governors of
                                FINRA, was created to review the fairness of compensation to be received by underwriters.
                                The offerings subject to review are equity and convertible debt issues.
                                    Nonconvertible debt and nonconvertible preferred stock are exempt if they are rated as
                                investment grade. Also exempt from having to file are offerings under Regulation D (Rule 505
                                and 506), U.S. government and agency securities, municipal securities, open-end management
                                companies, and unit trusts.
                                    Closed-end funds (publicly traded funds) are subject to filing, as are Regulation A offer-
                                ings, Rule 147 offerings, direct participation programs, right offerings, and securities sold under

                        5. 13. 1. 1 Information Filed
                                   To determine fairness, the syndicate manager files the following information with the
                                CFD:
                                ■■ The underwriting spread
                                ■■ Reimbursement of expenses from issuer to underwriter
                                ■■ The amount of any stock, warrants, or options received as part of the compensation pack-
                                   age
                                ■■ The right of first refusal to participate in future underwritings
                                ■■ Nonaccountable expense allowances
                                ■■ All other items of value including information on overallotment

                                     The CFD also will review any items of compensation received by the underwriters during
                                the 180-day period immediately preceding the filing of the registration statement. The idea
                                is to determine if any of these items have been received in connection with the offering. If
                                received during the 180-day period preceding the filing, the CFD will presume the compensa-
                                tion was received in connection with the offering.
                                     File the information previously noted with FINRA within one business day of filing a reg-
                                istration statement with the SEC.


                        5. 13. 1. 2 Unfair or Unreasonable Compensation
                                   The CFD considers the following to be unfair or unreasonable compensation:
                                ■■ Any options or warrants received by the underwriters that are exercisable below the public
                                   offering price
                                ■■ Any options or warrants received by the underwriters that have a life of more than five
                                   years
                                ■■ Any freely transferable stock received by the underwriters; stock received as part of the
                                   compensation package must be restricted for resale for 180 days from effective date; if the
                                   amount of securities received does not exceed 1% of the securities being offered, the lock-
                                   up period will not apply
                                ■■ Any nonaccountable expense allowance in excess of 3% of the underwriting spread
                                ■■ Any right of first refusal for future public or private offerings that has a duration of more
                                   than three years from the effective date
                                ■■ Any overallotment option (green shoe clause) that allows the underwriters to purchase,
                                   from the issuer, more than 15% of the stock being offered for public resale

                                   shares being offered to the public, this is considered unreasonable compensation
                                ■■ A tail fee continuing beyond two years

                                    A tail fee, sometimes called a termination fee, permits an underwriter to receive fees if
                                the underwriter’s services are terminated by an issuer, and then the issuer hires another under-
                                writer to complete the job. Any tail fee arrangement granted to the underwriter more than two
                                years from the date the member’s services are terminated would be considered unreasonable
                                compensation.

                                5. 13. 1. 2. 1 Reimbursement of Expenses
                                    In reviewing reimbursement of expenses from issuer to underwriter, the CFD looks for
                                reimbursements that are normally borne by the underwriters.




                     *
                    EXAMPLE                           If the underwriters are reimbursed by the issuer for paying blue-sky fees, there
                                                 is no problem, because these fees are normally paid by the issuer. If, however, the
                                                 underwriters are reimbursed for solicitation costs, this reimbursement would be
                                                 considered part of the overall compensation package, because this expense is nor-
                                                 mally borne by the underwriters and would be considered an unreasonable syndicate
                                                 expense from the underwriting fee.

                                    If informed by the CFD that the compensation is unreasonable, the syndicate manager
                                must immediately notify the other syndicate members and take steps to adjust the compensa-
                                tion items. Otherwise, the offering cannot occur.
                                    Rule 5190 is a requirement for those members participating in offerings, such as IPOs,
                                PIPEs, follow-on, secondary, blocks, “bought” offerings, shelf (both initial and subsequent
                                takedowns) et cetera, to examine each one individually to determine whether it is a “distribu-
                                tion” under Regulation M.
                                    The notice requirements of Rule 5190 apply to any offering of a covered exchange-listed
                                security or an OTC Equity Security, (Unit 4 describes an OTC Equity Security as a non-NMS
                                security) that meets the definition of a “distribution” and does not qualify as excepted activity,
                                such as Rule 144A transactions, or as an excepted security, such as investment grade non-con-
                                vertible debt or preferred stock. The notice requirements of Rule 5190 apply to both securities
                                subject to a restricted period and to those securities that are “actively traded.”
                                    For a distribution that is subject to a restricted period, firms must provide notification to
                                FINRA (via the Regulation M Restricted Period Notification) of the firm’s determination of
                                the applicable restricted period, and the basis for that determination, along with the date of
                                commencement of the restricted period, no later than the business day prior to the first com-
                                plete trading session of the applicable restricted period, unless later notification is necessary
                                under specific circumstances.

                                                      A “bought deal” is a firm commitment by the underwriter who purchases the se-

                                                 underwriter then re-sells the securities on a best-efforts basis.

                  5. 14             SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 REPORTING
                                    REQUIREMENTS


                  5. 14. 1 FILINGS BY ISSUERS
                                            Once an issuer is publicly traded, it is obligated to file certain reports with the SEC. These
                                        include an annual report on Form 10-K [Form 20-F for foreign private issuers (FPIs)] and quar-
                                        terly reports on Form 10-Q. Other required reporting events include the following.

                                             Form 8-K (the Current Report). Use this form to report newsworthy events to the SEC,
                                        such as change in management, change in the company’s name, mergers or acquisitions, and
                                        major new product introductions. Only domestic issuers use this form. FPIs are exempt from
                                        filing Forms 8-K but may instead be required to furnish Forms 6-K, which largely serve the
                                        same purpose of making material information available to the public. Form 6-K also may be
                                        used to register ADRs. ADRs, which are U.S.-registered securities, also are exempt, because
                                        the underlying company is non-U.S.


                  5. 14. 2 FILINGS BY NONISSUERS
                                            Corporate insiders, such as officers and directors, are required to file information on
                                        changes in their holdings with the SEC. Form 3 is used for the initial report, while Form 4 is
                                        used for subsequent reports. When an investor, investor group, or other entity acquires a 5%
                                        or more interest in an issuer of securities, that person must file Schedule 13-D with the SEC.
                                        The form must include information on the person’s intentions with regard to seeking control
                                        of the issuer. The form also is filed with the issuer and with the market where the security
                                        principally trades.

                                                             Report any changes in insider holdings to the SEC within two business days of
                                                        the change.

                                            Schedule 13-D filing requirements do not apply to insiders. If an officer acquires a 5% or
                                        more interest, this information is provided to the SEC on Form 4.
                                            Investment companies and related entities use Schedule 13-G if they acquire a 5% or
                                        more interest in an issuer. Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, investment compa-
                                        nies are prohibited from controlling, or seeking to control, any issuer. Therefore, a 13-G, not
                                        13-D, is the required filing, and it must be made within 45 days after each calendar year-end
                                        during which the position is held.
                                            Form 13F is filed by institutional investment managers who have discretion over $100 mil-
                                        lion or more in Section 13(f) securities. Form 13F is required to be filed within 45 days of the
                                        end of a calendar quarter. Among other things, the 13F requires disclosure of the name and
                                        class, the CUSIP number, and the number of shares as of the end of the calendar quarter. It
                                        also requires disclosure of the total market value of those equity securities under management
                                        that trade on an exchange, such as Nasdaq and the NYSE, as well as certain options, warrants,
                                        and closed-end investment company shares. Mutual funds are not on the list of reportable
                                        securities.

       5. 15            FAIR DISCLOSURE (REGULATION FD)

                                    Regulation Fair Disclosure (Regulation FD) was adopted by the SEC to curb the selective
                                disclosure of material nonpublic information by issuers to analysts and institutional investors.
                                Regulation FD requires that when an issuer discloses material information, it does so publicly
                                to provide a level playing field.
                                    Regulation FD also addressed the intentional and unintentional disclosure of material,
                                nonpublic information. Whenever an issuer (or any person acting on its behalf) discloses
                                material, nonpublic information to any person outside the issuer, the issuer must simultane-
                                ously make public disclosure of that same information if the disclosure is intentional. In the
                                case of unintentional disclosure, the issuer must promptly (before the start of the next trading
                                day) make public disclosure.
                                    Regulation FD permits issuers to make public disclosure by filing or furnishing a Form 8-K
                                with the Commission or by disseminating information “through another method (or combina-
                                tion of methods) of disclosure that is reasonably designed to provide broad, non-exclusionary
                                distribution of the information to the public.” Public conference calls, press releases, and web-
                                casts are allowable, Regulation FD-compliant, methods of public disclosure.



       5. 16            REGULATION FD COMPLIANT METHODS OF DISCLOSURE

                                    Regulation FD compliant methods of disclosure include any of the following, or combina-
                                tion of the following:
                                ■■ A broadly disseminated press release
                                ■■ Filing a Form 8-K, 10-Q, or 10-K with the SEC
                                ■■ Widely available, non-exclusionary conference calls
                                ■■ Press conferences or webcasts with adequate notice that are freely accessible
                                ■■ Company websites

                                    Companies must provide disclosures so that clear information is readily available to readers.

                  5. 17             SARBANES-OXLEY ACT

                                             The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, sometimes referred to as SOX, was enacted in response
                                        to a number of major corporate and accounting scandals, including Enron and WorldCom.
                                        This legislation established enhanced standards for all U.S. public company boards, manage-
                                        ment, and public accounting firms. Among other things, SOX created the Public Company
                                        Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) to oversee, regulate, inspect, and discipline account-
                                        ing firms in their roles as auditors of public companies. SOX also covers issues such as audi-
                                        tor independence, corporate governance, internal control assessment, and enhanced financial
                                        disclosure.
                                             Section 302 of SOX addresses internal control certifications. The principal executive offi-

                                        statements or omissions of material facts, and that they have evaluated their internal controls
                                        within the previous 90 days and have reported on their findings.
                                             Section 401 of SOX addresses disclosure in periodic reports, focusing on the require-
                                        ment that financial statements include all material off-balance sheet liabilities, obligations,
                                        or transactions.
                                             Section 402 of SOX requires enhanced conflict of interest provisions. The major result
                                        of this section is the prohibition of personal loans to executives. Loans for home improve-
                                        ments and securities purchases on margin are examples of several limited exceptions to the
                                        prohibition.
                                             Section 403 of SOX requires that, within 10 days of becoming an officer, director, or
                                        greater than 10% shareholder of a publicly traded issuer, such person must file with the SEC a
                                        statement as to his/her ownership of the common stock of the issuer.
                                             Section 404 of SOX requires issuers to publish information in their annual reports con-
                                        cerning the scope and adequacy of their internal accounting controls. Independent account-
                                        ing firms, in the same report, must attest to, and report on, their assessment of the effectiveness
                                        of the issuer’s internal controls.



                  5. 18             FAIRNESS OPINIONS (FINRA RULE 5150)

                                            FINRA Rule 5150 requires specific disclosures related to conflicts of interest, which could
                                        arise when a member firm provides a fairness opinion in connection with mergers, acquisi-

                                sideration offered in a transaction is within the range of what would be considered fair. In a
                                fairness opinion, a member firm is required to disclose:
                                ■■ if the firm has acted as a financial advisor to any party to the transaction and, if applicable,
                                    that it will receive compensation that is contingent upon the successful completion of the
                                    transaction;
                                ■■ any material relationships that existed during the past two years with any party involved
                                    in the transaction and whether any compensation was or will be received as a result of the
                                    relationship;
                                ■■ if any information that formed a basis for the opinion was supplied to the firm by the party
                                    requesting the opinion and whether this information was independently verified;
                                ■■ if the fairness opinion was approved or issued by a fairness committee; and
                                ■■ whether the fairness opinion expresses a view about the fairness of the amount or nature
                                    of the compensation to any of the company’s officers or directors relative to the compensa-
                                    tion to the public shareholders of the company.

                                    A member firm that issues fairness opinions must have procedures in place regarding the
                                circumstances in which it will use a fairness committee to approve or issue a fairness opinion.
                                Procedures must include the process for selecting personnel to be on the committee, the nec-
                                essary qualifications for such persons, and the process to promote a balanced review by the
                                committee. In other words, the committee should include persons who did not serve on the
                                deal team.



       5. 19            HART SCOTT RODINO (HSR)

                                    This Act (HSR) is an amendment to the antitrust laws and requires both parties to an
                                intended acquisition or merger to file information on the proposed transaction with the FTC
                                and the Department of Justice. Upon filing, a 30-day waiting period (15 days for all-cash trans-
                                actions) ensues during which time the FTC and the Department of Justice makes a determina-
                                tion as to whether the proposed transaction violates antitrust laws.
                                    It is unlawful to close the transaction during the waiting period. Although the waiting
                                period can be as long as 30 days, the FTC may request additional time to review the informa-
                                tion presented. On the other hand, the filing parties may request that the waiting period be
                                terminated early if there are no obvious impediments to the deal.

                                                      The filing requirement is triggered only if the value of the transaction exceeds
                                                 certain dollar thresholds, which are adjusted upward over time. As of 2014, a filing is
                                                 required if the value of the transaction exceeds a $75.9 million threshold.
                                                      Related to HSR is Regulation M-A, which has been designed to provide guide-
                                                 lines to companies involved in tender offers as well as mergers and acquisitions.
                                                 Among other things, it requires that a summary term sheet be provided to investors
                                                 as part of the disclosure process. The summary term sheet must be on the first or sec-
                                                 ond page of the disclosure document and must contain the material facts about the
                                                 proposed transaction in bullet format.

                  5. 20             RESEARCH REPORTS

                                            The SEC defines a research report as a client communication, distributed to at least 15
                                        persons, that analyzes individual securities and provides information on which to base an
                                        investment decision. All research reports, at minimum, must make the following disclosures:
                                        ■■ Market price at date of report
                                        ■■ If the member is a market maker in the security being recommended
                                        ■■ If a control relationship exists between the member and the issuer of the security being
                                            recommended (e.g., an officer of the member sits on the issuer’s board of directors)
                                        ■■ If the member or its officers have a financial interest in any of the recommended issuer’s
                                            securities and the nature of the interest (a member that discloses that it owns 1% or more
                                            of any class of common equity securities of the recommended issuer is deemed to be in
                                            compliance with the requirement to disclose its financial interest)
                                        ■■ If the member was a manager or co-manager of any offering of the issuer within the last 12
                                            months (selling group participation is not disclosed)
                                        ■■ The member also must provide, or offer to furnish on request, additional information sup-
                                            porting the recommendation

                                            In addition, member firms may show the price history of the recommended security. If
                                        shown, the member must show price performance for at least 12 months prior. Further, the
                                        member may show past recommendations in its research reports. If it does, however, it can
                                        only show recommendations it has made of comparable companies, and it must show all com-
                                        parable recommendations made within the last 12 months.

                                           Spot Checks. As a final check on a member’s compliance with FINRA rules on com-
                                        munications with the public, FINRA, at any time, can spot-check a member’s records.


                  5. 20. 1 INVESTMENT ANALYSIS TOOLS (FINRA RULE 2214)
                                            FINRA’s communications and disclosures rules generally prohibit members from making
                                        predictions regarding investments. However, with the availability of technological tools that
                                        use a formula to calculate the probability of different outcomes given a particular investment or
                                        strategy, FINRA now permits the use of investment analysis tools under certain circumstances.
                                            To offer such tools, a member must provide the following to customers:
                                        ■■ A description of the criteria and methodology used
                                        ■■ A statement that results may vary with each use and over time
                                        ■■ A description, if applicable, of the universe of investments used in the analysis
                                        ■■ A statement that the outcomes projected by the tool are hypothetical in nature and are
                                            not guarantees of future results

                                    Furthermore, members that offer or intend to offer an investment analysis tool must pro-
                                vide FINRA with access to the tool within 10 days of first use (postfiling). If the tool is offered
                                exclusively to institutional investors, the filing requirement does not apply.


       5. 20. 2 RESEARCH ANALYST CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
                                     NASD Rule 2711 (Proposed FINRA Rule 2241) is intended to improve the objectivity
                                of research reports and provide investors with more useful and reliable information when mak-
                                ing investment decisions. Members must take steps to ensure that all research reports reflect an
                                analyst’s honest view and that any recommendation is not influenced by conflicts of interest,
                                such as investment banking business with the issuer.
                                     If a member issues a report or a research analyst renders an opinion that is inconsistent
                                with the analyst’s actual views regarding a subject company, FINRA considers such action
                                to constitute a fraudulent act and conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles of
                                trade.
                                     Members, which are subject to this rule, must adopt WSPs that ensure compliance. A
                                senior officer of a member must electronically attest annually to FINRA by April 1 of each
                                year that it has adopted and implemented those procedures and that the compensation of
                                each research analyst was reviewed and approved and the basis for the compensation was
                                documented.


       5. 20. 3 CONTACT BETWEEN RESEARCH ANALYSTS AND
                INVESTMENT BANKING PERSONNEL
                                    To prevent conflicts of interest between the delivery of research and activities of the firm’s
                                investment banking department, the rules require the following:
                                ■■ Prohibit investment banking personnel from supervising or controlling research analysts
                                    and from influencing analysts’ compensation
                                ■■ Bar investment banking personnel from discussing research reports with analysts prior to
                                    issuance; investment bankers cannot approve research reports
                                ■■ Preclude firms from tying analyst compensation to specific investment banking transac-
                                    tions
                                ■■ Preclude analysts from becoming involved in any effort to solicit investment banking busi-
                                    ness from existing or prospective clients
                                ■■ Prohibit analysts from participating in a road show relating to an investment banking
                                    transaction

                                                     Investment banking personnel may review a research report before issuance only
                                                 to verify the factual accuracy of information in the report and to identify any potential
                                                 conflicts of interest. However, any communication in this regard between investment
                                                 bankers and analysts must be made through a legal or compliance official of the

                  5. 20. 4 LIMITATIONS ON CONTACTS BETWEEN RESEARCH
                           ANALYSTS AND ISSUERS
                                    The new rules prohibit the use of research reports and ratings to influence issuer decisions
                                regarding securities offerings. Specifically, the new rules prohibit analysts from:
                                ■■ sharing draft reports with issuers for any reason other than fact checking (a firm’s legal or
                                    compliance department must approve any changes suggested by the issuer);
                                ■■ sharing with the issuer information on the price target, proposed rating, or the research
                                    summary; and
                                ■■ offering or threatening to withhold favorable ratings as inducement for future investment
                                    banking business.


                  5. 20. 5 QUIET PERIODS
                                    A member firm, acting as manager or co-manager of a securities offering, may not publish
                                research nor may an analyst make a public appearance regarding the subject company for 40
                                days following an initial public offering (IPO), or for 10 days following an additional issue
                                offering.
                                    There are two exceptions to the quiet periods rule.
                                ■■ If there is a significant news event affecting the subject company, firms may issue a research
                                    report and analysts may make a public appearance during the applicable quiet period pro-
                                    vided they are authorized to do so by a legal or compliance department official.
                                ■■ If the subject company is an actively traded security as defined in Regulation M, SEC Rule
                                    139 allows research to be issued and public appearances to be made during the 10-day
                                    quiet period applicable to additional issue offerings (discussed further in the investment
                                    banking Unit).

                                     The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (or JOBS Act) is intended to facilitate capital
                                formation for emerging growth companies (EGC). (An EGC has a total annual gross revenues
                                of less than $1 billion.)
                                     Essentially, the Act prohibits the SEC and FINRA from adopting a rule in connection
                                with an IPO of an EGC that restricts, based on functional role, which AP of a broker-dealer
                                may arrange for communications between an analyst and a potential investor. In addition, the
                                Commission may not prohibit a securities analyst from participating in communicating with
                                the management of an EGC that is also attended by any other AP of a broker-dealer whose
                                functional role is other than as securities analyst.
                                     Furthermore, the SEC may not prohibit a broker-dealer from publishing or distributing
                                any research report or making a public appearance within any prescribed time period following
                                the IPO date of the emerging growth company.


                  5. 20. 6 REQUIRED DISCLOSURES IN RESEARCH REPORTS AND
                           PUBLIC APPEARANCES
                                   To ensure that the investing public receives objective information, the rules require:
                                ■■ firms to clearly explain their rating systems, use rating terms according to their plain mean-
                                   ing, note the percentage of all ratings that they have assigned to each category (e.g., buy/
                                   sell/hold), and document the percentage of investment banking clients in each category;
                                ■■ analysts to disclose if their compensation is tied to the firm’s investment banking revenues;

                                ■■ disclosure in analyst’s research reports and public appearances if they or any member of
                                   their households have a financial interest in the subject security, and if their employer
                                   firms owned 1% or more of any class of a subject company’s equity securities at the close
                                   of the previous month;
                                ■■ research reports to disclose if, within the last 12 months, the firm has received fees for
                                   investment banking services from or managed or co-managed a public offering for a com-
                                   pany that is the subject of a research report (they also must disclose if the firm expects to
                                   receive or intends to seek in the three months following publication of a research report,
                                   any investment banking fees from any company that is the subject of a report); and
                                ■■ disclosure if the subject company is or was during the 12 months before issuance of the
                                   report, a client of the member.


       5. 20. 7 RESTRICTIONS ON PERSONAL TRADING BY ANALYSTS
                AND RELATED PERSONS
                                    The new rules impose restrictions on trading activity by analysts that prepare research and
                                their household members. The new rules prohibit analysts and members of their households
                                from:
                                ■■ investing in a company’s securities either (1) prior to the company’s initial public offering
                                    if the company is in the business sector covered by the analyst, or (2) for 30 days before
                                    and 5 days after the analyst issues a research report on the company or changes a rating or
                                    a price target on the company; and
                                ■■ ntrading against the analyst’s most recent recommendation.


       5. 20. 8 BOOSTER SHOTS
                                    In public offerings, officers of the issuing company often buy shares at the public offering
                                price. These shares are subject to a lock-up period (e.g., 12 months) during which the officers,
                                directors, and issuer-directed shareholders are prohibited from selling the shares acquired in
                                the offering. They are free to sell their shares once the lock-up period ends, following an
                                announcement by the book-running manager to the issuer and the general public through a
                                major news service at least two business days prior to the release of the stock that the lock-up
                                period is over.
                                    To create a more favorable selling environment for the insiders, the underwriters would
                                sometimes issue research reports (booster shots) at the end of the lock-up period. The officers
                                would reciprocate by directing investment banking business to the firm(s) issuing booster shot
                                research reports. To curb this activity, firms that acted as manager or co-manager of a securities
                                offering may not publish a research report or make a public appearance for 15 days before and
                                15 days after the expiration of the lock-up period. Due to the JOBS Act, FINRA is expected to
                                withdraw the booster shot restrictions for companies that have less than $1 billion in revenue
                                ahead of their IPOs. Check with your instructor for the latest information about this evolving
                                law and accompanying rules.

                  5. 20. 9 TERMINATION OF COVERAGE
                                            If a member firm intends to terminate its research coverage of a subject company, notice of
                                        coverage termination must be made. The member must publish a final research report on the
                                        company that must be comparable in scope and detail to prior reports and must include a final
                                        recommendation or rating. If it is not practical to produce a comparable report with a final
                                        recommendation or rating (e.g., the analyst covering the company has left the firm), the final
                                        research report must disclose the member’s rationale for its decision to terminate coverage.


                  5. 20. 10 SUPERVISORY PROCEDURES
                                             Each member firm must adopt written supervisory procedures to ensure that the firm and
                                        its employees are in compliance with FINRA Rule 3130. Further, each member must attest
                                        annually that it has adopted and implemented these procedures. The annual attestation must
                                        be made by a senior officer of the member and must specifically address the compensation of
                                        research analysts, which is summarized as follows.
                                        ■■ Compensation cannot be tied to a specific investment banking transaction.
                                        ■■ A committee that reports to a member’s board of directors must review and approve at
                                             least annually the compensation of research analysts (investment banking personnel are
                                             prohibited from serving on the committee).
                                        ■■ The committee must document in writing the basis on which each analyst’s compensation
                                             was established. Factors the committee must consider include the quality of the research
                                             produced, the correlation between an analyst’s recommendations and stock price perfor-
                                             mance, and the overall ratings received from clients, independent rating services, and the
                                             member’s sales force.


                  5. 20. 11 THIRD-PARTY RESEARCH
                                            If a member distributes research produced by a nonmember affiliate, such as a foreign
                                        broker-dealer or an independent third party, it must accompany the research with third-party
                                        research disclosures, if applicable. These disclosures are the same as those required if the
                                        report had been prepared by the member. For example, is the distributing member a market
                                        maker in the stock? Has the distributing member received investment banking compensation
                                        from the subject company within the past 12 months?

                                                             The disclosure requirements do not apply to research reports prepared by an in-
                                                        dependent third party that the member makes available to its customers upon request
                                                        or through a member-maintained website. Also note that it is acceptable for an issuer
                                                        to pay an independent third party to prepare a research report if the disclosure of
                                                        payment is made.

       5. 20. 12 ANALYST CERTIFICATION (SEC REGULATION AC)
                                     Regulation AC requires member firms to include in research reports a statement by the
                                analyst certifying that the views expressed accurately reflect the analyst’s personal views and
                                a statement indicating whether the analyst’s compensation was or will be related to views in
                                the research report.
                                     Further, firms must prepare and maintain records relating to public appearances by research
                                analysts. Within 30 days after each calendar quarter, firms must make a record that includes a
                                statement by the analyst that the views expressed in all public appearances during the quarter
                                reflected the analyst’s personal view at that time. The record also must include a statement
                                by the analyst that no part of his compensation was or will be related to the views expressed.
                                     If the firm does not obtain these statements, it must notify its examining authority. In
                                addition, for 120 days thereafter, the firm must disclose in any research report it distributes
                                authored by that analyst that the analyst did not provide the required certification.

                                                      Regulation AC applies to research of any type (equity, fixed income, et cetera).



       5. 20. 13 INVESTMENT BANKING QUARTERLY REPORTS
                                    A member firm that has, as a line of business, investment banking services must file with
                                FINRA written reports signed by a senior officer within 10 business days of the end of each cal-
                                endar quarter describing each internal investigation initiated in the previous calendar quarter.
                                The report must include the date each internal investigation began, the status of each open
                                internal investigation, the resolution of any internal investigation reached during the previous
                                calendar quarter and, with respect to each internal investigation, the identity of the security,
                                trades, accounts, associated persons of the member, or associated person of the member’s fam-
                                ily members holding an account under review. The firm must also include a copy of the mem-
                                ber’s policies and procedures.
                                    If a violation of the 1934 Securities Exchange Act is uncovered during the review, the firm

                        TRADING CYCLE
                                    Many who sit for the Series 24 exam have worked in the securities business for years, even
                                decades. That said, it is more the rule than the exception that most aspiring General Securities
                                Principals have little to no hands-on trading experience. It might be useful to delineate the
                                basics of trading in order to put the topic into perspective before tackling the Trading and
                                Market Making Unit of the LEM. We will also touch on a few of the key regulatory concerns
                                pertaining to trading. This is a back-to-basics review, so we’re limiting this discussion to only
                                long sales of equity securities.
                                    Retail equity trading is largely automated; much of it happens in real time. Here, in slow
                                motion, are the basic steps involved.

                                    First:      Customer places an order with a broker-dealer.
                                    Second:     It is then checked and validated.
                                    Third:      It is routed and executed.
                                    Fourth:     It is reported.
                                    Fifth:      It is then processed and settled.

                                    Let’s take a look now at these steps in more detail starting with placing an order.

                                    1. THE ORDER

                                     A customer order may be placed through a live phone conversation, in person, by email
                                (if acceptable to the BD), or through an online system provided by the firm. Voicemail orders
                                are rarely, if ever, accepted. An individual customer order is called a retail order. Orders from
                                an institution are called wholesale, or institutional, orders.
                                     For example, Mrs. Lee is looking to add an addition to her home. She concludes that the
                                best way to fund this project is to sell some of her stock. She calls her broker and places the
                                sell order.
                                     Equity orders are priced at either the BID or the ASK. The bid price is what an industry
                                buyer such as a broker-dealer is willing to pay for a stock that’s being sold by the customer. The
                                ask/offer is the price a BD is willing to sell the security at (i.e., the sale price).
                                     From the customer’s point of view, the stock is sold for the bid price and bought at the ask/
                                offer. If the market were 40.30–40.33, Mrs. Lee could expect to receive $40.30 per share less a
                                commission or a markdown.
                                     Here’s where it begins to get a bit dicey. Exchange-listed securities trade on an inter-market
                                basis. That means, stocks often trade not only on the exchange where it is listed but also on
                                other exchanges that have unlisted trading privileges (UTP) or in the OTC market. As a result,
                                there are many different prices put up from those different exchanges and markets. There isn’t
                                just one bid or ask price. This would be massively complicated if it were not for the services
                                of a SIP—Securities Information Processor. The SIP (there are only three of them) gather
                                and consolidate all the information pouring in from the participants (such as Nasdaq or NYSE
                                MKT) and come up with the best bid and offer (i.e., the NBBO, National Best Bid and Offer).
                                That information is then disseminated.

       414         Appendix A



                                     Here’s the takeaway: The three SIPs in the United States that collect, consolidate, and
                                disseminate all price and trade data from our 11 stock exchanges come up with the NBBO.
                                Mrs. Lee then has confidence the markets are working for her. She knows that, subject to her
                                place in line, she’s going to receive the best price for her stock.
                                     In late 2014, Nasdaq OMX Group won the bid to operate one of the three SIPs known as
                                Tape C. (Its official nomenclature is the UTP Plan). It’s a tough job operating a SIP. Securities
                                Information Processors have to be on top of their game in a big way, providing quotes in micro-
                                seconds and having a reliable backup.
                                     The NYSE in late 2014 experienced a glitch with its two SIPs that forced a shift of opera-
                                tions out to a backup in Chicago. Those two SIPs, known on the street as Tape A and Tape
                                B, serve all exchange-listed securities (excluding those listed on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange);
                                the Consolidated Tape Association provides both tapes, sometimes known as the CTA/CQ
                                Plan. Moving to Chicago was part of the CTA’s business continuity plan.
                                     Sometimes Nasdaq has issues, too. Not long ago, trading in Nasdaq halted due to a fail-
                                ure of the UTP SIP. Quote dissemination broke down. Thanks to unlisted trading privileges
                                (UTP), Nasdaq stocks trade on the NYSE MKT but only if the SIP is doing its job. A glitch in
                                the SIP may corrupt the entire NMS quote stream.
                                     A SIP’s contract can provide for some good revenue, but the big money comes from the sale
                                of information to market-data providers like Bloomberg. That revenue is then divided up from
                                the three SIPs among the exchanges. FINRA also gets a chunk. In short, the SIP is responsible
                                to consolidate and distribute data (such as the NBBO) in real time to various media vendors.
                                The SIP is essentially the glue that holds the $24 trillion U.S. equity markets together and
                                satisfies a big part of the purpose SEC Regulation NMS (National Market System).

             TRADING ON A PRINCIPAL OR AGENCY BASIS
                                    Agency
                                    Those broker dealers that trade on an agency basis charge commissions. There is no own-
                                ership risk. Mrs. Lee would likely be charged a commission.

                                   Principal
                                   BDs that trade on a principal basis do so to and from their own inventory. They assume
                                ownership and, therefore, have inventory risk.
                                   BDs trading in this fashion are compensated in one of two ways or both.
                                    —— Buying and selling at the NBBO at the same time. This is known as “spread trading,”
                                       namely profiting from the difference between buying at the best bid and selling at the
                                       best offer. Market makers (MMs) attempt to do this by trading “the book.”
                                    —— BDs can mark a trade up or down. While most trades take place at the NBBO price,
                                       illiquid equities can be marked up or down. Some international customers may request
                                       a markup or markdown rather than a commission due to tax considerations unique to
                                       that country.

                                    It is important to note that once an order is received from a customer, the firm generally
                                cannot trade that security for its own account at a better price than what would satisfy a cus-
                                tomer’s order unless that order is also immediately executed at the size and at the same price as
                                the firm trade or better. Trading ahead of customer orders would likely be deemed a violation
                                of the Manning Rule.
                                    Orders placed by reps must capture the relevant order information like the symbol, trans-
                                action type, order type, and any other qualifier. The SEC’s books and records rule requires this
                                information be collected and can be placed manually on a paper order ticket or electronically




Series_24_9e_Rev_LEM.indb 414                                                                                                       5/27/2015 7:38:54 AM
                                                                                                                Appendix A       415



                                through an online order entry system. In either case, it must be time stamped. These records
                                must be maintained for three years; the first two years must be maintained in a readily acces-
                                sible place.

                                    2. CHECKED AND VALIDATED

                                     When the order is entered, the details of it should be checked to ensure accuracy. If a stock
                                symbol is entered incorrectly, it would likely result in a broken trade, which could cost the
                                firm and representative not only money but loss of reputation as well. It must be checked to
                                ensure accuracy. Account numbers and other personal account information should be checked
                                to ensure it, too, is accurate.
                                     A check also needs to be made to make sure the customer is authorized to enter a certain
                                type of order. For example, clients looking to buy a stock on margin must have an account that
                                is authorized to do so. Following a thorough check, the order is routed for execution.

                                    3. ROUTING AND EXECUTION

                                     Although routing can be handled nowadays with dynamic routers provided by third par-
                                ties, ordinarily high-touch trading starts with the firm’s trading desk or department. Exactly
                                where the order is ultimately executed depends on a variety of things, such as which market
                                provides the most historical liquidity and improved prices or which stock market has the fast-
                                est trade execution platform.
                                     That last one is very important for those high-frequency traders (HFTs) who rely on very
                                low latency for certain algorithmic trading schemes. The expression low latency is just a fancy
                                way of saying quick trading. It’s not unusual nowadays to have a DMA (direct market access)
                                customer enter and have executed 5,000 or 6,000 orders or more in one second. Trades are
                                being executed and reported in microseconds. HFT customers are the most likely customers
                                to be provided by their broker-dealer with DMA, which bypasses the firm’s trading desk. This
                                kind of DMA trading is called low or “no-touch.” No-touch doesn’t mean no obligation; the
                                broker-dealers still have an obligation to monitor their DMA customer’s behavior. No broker-
                                dealer can throw its hands up and say to the regulators, “We didn’t know what they were
                                doing.”
                                     The desk may send an order to some exchange or to an OTC market maker. Another
                                method is by using an ATS (alternative trading system). An ATS is a trading system (there are
                                dozens) that is essentially an electronic system for matching buyers and sellers.
                                     ATSs play an important role in accessing additional liquidity and speed beyond what is
                                found in traditional stock markets. In some cases, such as trading large blocks, an ATS can
                                protect the price. Trading away from an exchange could possibly avoid a sharp fall in the price
                                caused by flooding the market with a lot of shares. An example of one type of ATS is a dark
                                pool, where institutional investors may trade in large blocks without showing their hand to
                                others, thereby avoiding market impact. Dark pools account for about 17% of the trading vol-
                                ume in the U.S. stock market.
                                     Apart from using an exchange, OTC market makers, or an ATS, the firm may execute
                                internally on a principal basis or cross it with another customer order.
                                     Many introducing firms rely on their clearing firm to help execute orders. Under FINRA’s
                                Best Execution Rule 5310, BDs must use reasonable due diligence to obtain the most favorable
                                prices possible in a given market for their customers.
                                     One step to assure compliance with this rule is to assess and compare from time to time
                                the order execution quality received with what could have been received if the order had been
                                routed differently. The trading desk has to have a reasonable and justifiable belief that sending
                                an order to some ATS or MM results in a generally better price than had they sent it to some
                                other venue.




Series_24_9e_Rev_LEM.indb 415                                                                                                5/27/2015 7:38:54 AM
       416         Appendix A



                                    If an introducing broker relies upon its clearing firm to route orders, it is the clearing firm
                                that must do an order execution quality assessment. However, the IB is required to confirm
                                with its clearing firm that it is, in fact, performing the assessment in order to fulfill its own best
                                execution responsibility.

                                    4. REPORTING

                                    Once the trade is made, it must be reported so price and volume information about the
                                order can be disseminated to the investing public through the appropriate SIP.
                                    When trades are effected on an exchange such as Nasdaq or NYSE, it’s the job of the
                                exchange to handle the reporting through SIPs provided by the Consolidate Tape System
                                (CTS) for the NYSE, its smaller offshoots and regional exchanges, or by Nasdaq’s UTP Trade
                                Data Feed (UTDF).
                                    However, if the trade is effected over-the-counter, the BD executing the trade must do
                                the reporting. For example, if a trade were to take place in a non-NMS stock away from an
                                exchange or effect a trade in 144A restricted securities, the report would be made through the
                                OTC Reporting Facility (ORF). Information to be provided in the report includes
                                ■■ stock symbol,
                                ■■ number of shares,
                                ■■ time (in milliseconds),
                                ■■ price,
                                ■■ long or short sale,
                                ■■ step-in indicator (the ORF can match corresponding step-out and step-in submissions; see
                                    your LEM for more on step-outs), and
                                ■■ linking a reversal to the original trade.

                                    Whereas trading in NMS stocks on exchanges requires a high degree of linkage and
                                interdependency, non-NMS takes place across a number of connected BDs that are not
                                interdependent.
                                    In case you forgot from your Series 7 studies, a non-NMS stock would most often be a
                                small- or micro-cap stock, which is also called an OTC Equity Security. The expression “OTC
                                Equity Security” is more than a mere description; it actually has a proper legal definition.
                                They are securities NOT listed on a national securities exchange, such as NYSE and Nasdaq,
                                or securities listed on regional exchanges, but they do not qualify for dissemination of transac-
                                tion reports to the CTS/UTDF. An example of where one might find OTC Equity Securities
                                being traded includes the OTCBB and OTC Pink Market. Those trades, as you now know, are
                                reported to FINRA’s ORF system.
                                    Other FINRA reporting facilities include the Alternative Display Facility (ADF) for OTC
                                transactions in NMS stocks effected off-exchange and the Trade Reporting Facilities (TRFs),
                                to which firms report OTC transactions in NMS stocks taking place off-exchange but are listed
                                on an exchange. FINRA has established TRFs in conjunction with the pertinent exchange,
                                namely, FINRA/NASDAQ TRF and FINRA/NYSE TRF.
                                    The ADF serves both as a trade reporting and quotation display and collection facility for
                                purposes of transactions in NMS stocks effected away from an exchange.

                                   The ORF is the facility through which members report OTC transactions in OTC Equity
                                Securities and Restricted Equity Securities.

                                    FINRA OATS Reporting Requirement
                                    Lastly, a report must be made to the Order Audit Trail System (OATS). Firms are required
                                to establish an electronic method for reporting to OATS. How that connection is made is
                                beyond the scope of the Series 24. That’s an information technology specialty.
                                    OATS reports should include:
                                ■■ order type,
                                ■■ special handling codes,
                                ■■ order receipt time,
                                ■■ execution time,
                                ■■ critical order events,
                                ■■ receipt/transfer within the firm, and
                                ■■ route outside the firm.

                                    This all helps FINRA create a comprehensive audit trail for OTC Equity Securities as well
                                as exchange-listed securities. Proprietary orders in OTC Equity Securities made by bona fide
                                market makers in the stock are not subject to the reporting requirements of OATS.
                                    When two BDs, for example, open a “conversation” using the OTC Link (an ATS oper-
                                ated by the OTC Markets, Inc., the modern day descendent of the Pink Sheets), FINRA
                                considers that a negotiation over the phone for purposes of OATS reporting, and negotiations
                                are not reportable events. Only when the terms of a trade are agreed to is the new order and
                                execution reportable, with the time the parties agreed to those terms as the order receipt time
                                and the execution time.

                    EXAMPLE                         The specific reporting requirements for OTC Link messages that result in an ex-
                                                ecution are as follows:
                                                     A firm is required to report all executions that are a result of the firm receiving an
                                                OTC Link message, regardless of whether the OTC Link message is sent by a mar-
                                                ket maker or a non-market maker broker-dealer. As previously noted, both the new
                                                order and execution are reportable once the terms of a trade are agreed to, with the
                                                time the parties agreed to those terms as the order receipt time and the execution
                                                time. The OATS execution report must be linked to the related trade report submitted
                                                to the ORF.
                                                    Introducing broker-dealers may have an understanding with the clearing firm that
                                                they are handling the reporting responsibilities. If so, it should be clear understanding
                                                in writing. Then verify that their trades are being reported.

                                    5. PROCESSING AND SETTLEMENT
                                    DTCC Report (A non-media report)

                                    Trade information is not only sent to the applicable reporting facility but it must also be
                                sent to the DTCC for processing and settlement. DTCC debits the account of one broker-
                                dealer and credits another. Members are not required to submit non-tape reports like these to
                                FINRA within 10 seconds of trade execution. There is more information about the 10-second
                                reporting rule in Unit 4.
                                    Once the trade is executed and reported, a confirmation to the customer must be sent
                                within one business day after the trade date. This is done by clearing firms on behalf of their
                                correspondent IBs. Following that, the trade cycle is complete.
