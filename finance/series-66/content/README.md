# Series 66: Uniform Combined State Law Examination

## Overview
The Series 66 exam combines the Series 63 (Uniform Securities Agent State Law) and Series 65 (Uniform Investment Adviser Law) into one comprehensive examination. It qualifies individuals to function as both agents (selling securities) AND investment adviser representatives (providing investment advice) at the state level.

## Regulatory Authority
