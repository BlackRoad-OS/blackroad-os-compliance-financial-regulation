            INTRODUCTION
                              Thank you for choosing Kaplan for your educational needs, and welcome to the Series 65
                              License Exam Manual (LEM). We understand that you are trusting us to help you advance in
                              your securities industry career. We have written this manual and any supplemental resources
                              you may have purchased by first collecting and clarifying exam-related content. Exam content
                              is provided for you in an adult-learning framework that offers the tools you need to pass your
                              exam on the first try. Some of these tools include:
                               exam-focused questions and content to maximize exam preparation;
                               an interactive design that integrates content with questions to increase retention; and
                               integrated SecuritiesProTM QBank exam preparation tools to sharpen test-taking skills.


                              Why Do I Need to Pass the Series 65?
                              Most states require those who give investment advice or perform related functions to pass
                              a qualification exam. The North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA)
                              created the Series 65 Uniform Investment Adviser Law Exam as one of the options that
                              may be used to meet that requirement. Most students use this examination to qualify as an
                              investment adviser representative (IAR), a supervised person of a registered investment adviser.


                              Are There Any Prerequisites?
                              There are no prerequisite exams to pass before sitting for the Series 65 Exam. However, the
                              exam assumes that you have a broad range of knowledge or experience with investments.
                              Because many students don’t yet have that background, this LEM attempts to cover all of the
                              basics as well as the more advanced material tested. Those of you with an SIE, Series 6, or
                              Series 7 registration will find these basics to be a good review that will help set the stage for
                              the more advanced learning required.

                              Passing the Series 65 normally is a prerequisite to getting licensed as an investment adviser
                              representative. However, most states will allow you to substitute one of the following
                              certifications for passing the exam:
                               CFP—Certified Financial Planner (granted by the CFP Board of Standards);
                               CIC—Chartered Investment Counselor (granted by the Investment Advisor Association);
                               ChFC—Chartered Financial Consultant (granted by the American College of Financial
                                 Services);
                               PFS—Personal Financial Specialist (granted by the American Institute of Certified Public
                                 Accountants); and
                               CFA—Chartered Financial Analyst (granted by the Chartered Financial Analyst
                                 Institute).

                              Applicants still have to meet other state licensing requirements, such as filing a Form U4 or
                              Form U10 and paying fees.

          x         Introduction



                                   What Is the Series 65 Exam Like?
                                   The exam is delivered on a computer at Prometric Testing Centers around the country.
                                   The session begins with a tutorial on how to take the exam. The Series 65 is a 180-minute,
                                   130-question exam (plus 10 unscored questions) prepared by NASAA and administered by
                                   the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). The unscored questions are not
                                   differentiated from the other questions and are randomly distributed throughout the
                                   exam. There is no penalty for guessing, so you should attempt to answer all items.


                                   What Score Must I Achieve to Pass?
                                   You need a score of at least 72% (94 questions correct of the 130 scored) on the Series
                                   65 exam to pass and become eligible for registration as a registered investment adviser
                                   representative. After your exam, you will receive either a notification that you passed (but no
                                   score) or a failing score with a printout that identifies your performance in each function area.


                                   Which Topics Will I See on the Exam?
                                   The questions you will see on the Series 65 exam do not appear in any particular order.
                                   The computer is programmed to select a new, random set of questions for each exam taker
                                   according to the preset topic weighting of the exam. Each Series 65 candidate will see the
                                   same number of questions on each topic but will see a different mix of questions. The Series
                                   65 content outline is divided into four major function areas.

                                   How Is This Course Structured?
                                   As professional educators, we have structured the material from the four job functions in the
                                   order that helps you best understand it. That means the program will diverge from the order
                                   listed in the previous table, but everything will be covered. The course consists of 24 units,
                                   each devoted to content that you will need to know to pass your exam. Each unit consists of
                                   one or more lessons. Each lesson corresponds to a specifically identified job function. These
                                   lessons are further divided into learning objectives (LOs) that help you focus on and retain a
                                   manageable portion of material. For students attending one of our classes, live or online, the
                                   class lecture will follow the sequence of these units.

            PREPARING FOR THE EXAM
                               Using the Study Calendar
                               On your dashboard, you will have a Study Calendar that you can customize to your personal
                               schedule. The Study Calendar helps you plan your use of all the other study tools you may
                               have in your package, including the class. Set up your Study Calendar so that you will know
                               what to do each day. The calendar gives you step-by-step details to optimize your learning
                               experience. Think of it as a road map. If you don’t take any detours or shortcuts, you will
                               arrive safely at your destination: a passing score.

                               The License Exam Manual (LEM) is your textbook for this course. Reading the LEM carefully
                               will help you succeed. Reading material several times may be useful.

                               Sometimes, out of necessity, a term or phrase is used prior to its formal introduction in the
                               course. If needed, you can consult the glossary for the definition or the index to locate a more
                               complete discussion of a term.

                               You also may have access to a PDF copy of the LEM. If so, we strongly recommend that you
                               download it because you can use the search function (Ctrl + F) to find specific terms quickly.

                               In addition to the regular text, the LEM also has some unique features designed to help
                               with quick understanding of the material. When additional emphasis is valuable to your
                               comprehension, the following distinctions are made:

                                         TAKE NOTE
                                         Each Take Note provides special information designed to amplify important points.

                                         TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                         Each Test Topic Alert! reviews content that is especially likely to appear on the exam.

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              Examples provide practical applications of theory. They are quick, interactive,
                                              real-world illustrations of what you just read. Examples help ensure that you
                                              understand and retain material.


                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                              Within each LO, there may be one or more practice questions. We’ve designed these
                                              questions to help you see how the topic being discussed might be presented on the
                                              exam.

                                              KNOWLEDGE CHECK
                                              After each lesson, there is an opportunity for you to measure your comprehension.
                                              These short tests reinforce the essential material covered in that lesson. Answers are at
                                              the end of each unit. Complete the Knowledge Check and review explanations for all
                                              questions, whether you answered them right or wrong.


                                   Using Additional Study Resources
                                   To accompany and supplement your LEM, your study package may contain additional study
                                   resources. Be sure to spend some time on your dashboard, view the best practices PDF, and
                                   understand all that is available to help you study.


                                   Using the SecuritiesPro™ QBank
                                   Coordinating with the LEM, the SecuritiesPro™ QBank includes a large number of questions
                                   that are similar in style and content to those on the exam. You may use the QBank to generate
                                   exams for a specific unit or combination of units (the Study Calendar will prompt you to
                                   do this). Carefully review all rationales. Use the LO number to locate additional or related
                                   information on the test topic in your LEM if needed. Do one additional test of the suggested
                                   length on any topic on which you score under 60%.
                                    Do not become too overwhelmed or bogged down in any one unit. You don’t want to
                                      lose sight of the finish line because you’re having trouble with one hurdle. Keep moving
                                      forward. It’s a steady pace that wins the race.
                                    View rationales after each question initially, and spend time studying each rationale to
                                      learn the concepts. Later, you will want to create simulated exams in which scores and
                                      rationales should be viewed at the end of each exam.
                                    Perfection is not the goal during the early reading phase. While scores in the mid to high
                                      60s are good initially, aim for at least 80% correct on simulated exams.

                                   You will also use the QBank to create weighted simulated exams that mimic the proportional
                                   composition of the real exam. The Study Calendar specifies the ideal number of tests, but
                                   there is no upper limit on how many you can create.

                                   One thing you should know about the QBank is that the answer choices are scrambled each
                                   time you take a test. That is, if the first time you saw a specific question the correct answer was
                                   choice A, that correct answer might be choice D the next time. Please keep this in mind if you
                                   need to contact us regarding a question.

                               Using Fixed Exams
                               Checkpoint and Midterm Exams
                               Each unit is followed by a checkpoint exam, and, at the approximate midpoint of your
                               studies, there is a midterm exam. These are fixed (unchanging) exams. That is, unlike QBank
                               exams that include randomly selected questions, the checkpoints and midterm are the same
                               for everyone. They are designed to check your progress before advancing to the next unit.
                               Challenging questions have been specifically selected based on their topical coverage, and
                               they tend to match the average difficulty of the real exam. Because they are fixed exams, they
                               may be taken only once but can be reviewed as often as desired. Be sure to take these when
                               prompted by your Study Calendar.


                               Practice and Mastery Exams
                               You may also have fixed practice and mastery exams. These exams are designed to closely
                               replicate the true exam experience, both in the degree of difficulty and topical coverage. They
                               provide a score, diagnostic feedback, correct answers, and answer rationales. The practice and
                               mastery exams are sound indicators of potential actual exam scores—the better you do on
                               these exams, the more likely you are to pass your actual exam. These exams may be taken just
                               once and must be completed in one sitting.

                               After completing the practice and mastery exams, be sure to review your Performance Tracker
                               so you can identify areas of weakness. You can then create custom quizzes focused on topics as
                               needed. Also, review your LEM and video library for additional help.

                               We recommend taking the practice exam shortly after a scheduled class and the mastery exam
                               two to three days before your exam date as indicated in your Study Calendar.


                               Using the Video Library
                               You may also have access to videos on various topics in our video library. These short,
                               engaging videos cover key topics. If you have access to our video library, please review the
                               topics as you complete your assignments in the Study Calendar. Because many of the videos
                               are not exam specific, you may encounter material that is not covered in your LEM. Just skip
                               ahead until the slide shows something familiar.


                               Updates/Corrections Link
                               Don’t forget to regularly check the Updates/Corrections icon (located on your dashboard).
                               Information about rule and regulation changes and new information regarding your exam will
                               be posted there. Information about corrections to any errors in the text will be posted there as
                               well. Try as we may, errors are difficult to avoid in a text this large. In addition, our questions
                               are constantly updated to stay current with the content being tested. New topics covered in
                               the Content Updates/Corrections are added to the QBank and other exams.


                               How Much Time Should I Spend Studying?
                               Plan to spend approximately 60 to 120 hours following the Study Calendar. Spread your
                               study time over the four to five weeks before the date on which you are scheduled to take
                               the actual exam. Your time may vary depending on your reading rate, comprehension,
                               professional background, and study environment. Educational authorities recommend

                                   frequent study breaks. We have found that every 45 to 50 minutes is optimal. Stand up,
                                   stretch, walk around for about 10 to 15 minutes, and then get back to the task at hand.


                                   How Well Can I Expect to Do?
                                   The exams administered by NASAA are not easy. You must display considerable
                                   understanding and knowledge of the topics presented in this course to pass the exam and
                                   qualify for registration.

                                   We carefully designed the questions in our QBank to simulate the actual exam. The wording
                                   of QBank and actual exam questions will vary, but if you understand the subject matter, you
                                   will be able to find the correct response when you sit for the exam.

                                   In addition, our questions are constantly updated to stay current with the content being
                                   tested. New topics covered in the Content Updates/Corrections are added to the QBank and
                                   other exams.

                                   If you study diligently, complete all sections of the course by following your Study Calendar,
                                   and consistently score at least 80% on the simulated exams, you should be well prepared to
                                   pass the exam. However, it is important for you to realize that merely knowing the answers
                                   to our questions will not enable you to pass unless you also understand the essence of the
                                   information behind the questions.


                                   Test-Taking Tips
                                   Passing the exam depends not only on how well you learn the subject matter but also on how
                                   well you take exams. You can develop your test-taking skills—and improve your score—by
                                   learning a few test-taking techniques.
                                    Read the full question.
                                    Avoid jumping to conclusions by watching for hedge clauses.
                                    Interpret the unfamiliar question.
                                    Look for key words and phrases.
                                    Identify the intent of the question.
                                    Memorize key points.
                                    Use a calculator.
                                    Avoid changing answers.
                                    Pace yourself.
                                   Each of these techniques is explained here.


                                   Read the Full Question
                                   You cannot expect to answer a question correctly if you do not know what it is asking. If
                                   you see a question that seems familiar and easy, you might anticipate the answer, mark it,
                                   and move on before you finish reading it. This is a serious mistake. Be sure to read the full
                                   question before answering it. Mistakes are often made when assuming too much (or too
                                   little).

                               Avoid Jumping to Conclusions by Watching for Hedge Clauses
                               The questions on NASAA exams are often embellished with deceptive distractors as choices.
                               To avoid being misled by seemingly obvious answers, read each question and each answer
                               twice before selecting your choice.

                               Watch out for hedge clauses embedded in the question. (Examples of hedge clauses include
                               the terms if, not, all, none, and except.) In the case of if statements, the question can be
                               answered correctly only by taking into account the qualifier. If you ignore the qualifier, you
                               will not answer correctly.

                               Qualifiers are sometimes combined in a question. Some pairs that you will frequently see
                               are all except and none except. In general, when a question starts with all or none and ends
                               with except, you are looking for an answer that is opposite to what the question appears to be
                               asking.


                               Interpret the Unfamiliar Question
                               Do not be surprised if some questions on the exam seem unfamiliar at first. If you have
                               studied your material, you will have the information to answer all the questions correctly. The
                               challenge may be a matter of understanding what the question is asking.

                               Very often, questions present information indirectly. You may have to interpret the meaning
                               of certain elements before you can answer the question. Be aware that the exam will approach
                               a concept from different angles.


                               Look for Key Words and Phrases
                               Look for words that are tip-offs to the situation presented. For example, if you see the word
                               prospectus in the question, you know the question is about a new issue. Sometimes a question
                               will even supply you with the answer if you can recognize the key words it contains. Few
                               questions provide blatant clues, but many do offer key words that can guide you to selecting
                               the correct answer if you pay attention. Be sure to read all instructional phrases carefully. Take
                               time to identify the key words to answer this type of question correctly.


                               Identify the Intent of the Question
                               Many questions on NASAA exams supply so much information that you lose track of what
                               is being asked. This is often the case in story problems. Learn to separate the story from the
                               question.

                               Take the time to isolate what the question is asking. Of course, your ability to do so assumes
                               you have studied sufficiently. There is no method for correctly answering questions if you
                               don’t know the material.


                               Memorize Key Points
                               Reasoning and logic will help you answer many questions, but you will have to memorize
                               a good deal of information first. Some memorization will be automatic as you go over the
                               material and answer questions; some you will simply have to do systematically.

          xvi       Introduction



                                   Use a Calculator
                                   Any math required to answer a question will be simple: add, subtract, multiply, and divide.
                                   We recommend using a calculator for math. You may ask for a calculator or ask if you can use
                                   your own. If using your own, only simple math functions are allowed (add, subtract, multiply,
                                   and divide).


                                   Avoid Changing Answers
                                   If you are unsure of an answer, your first hunch is the one most likely to be correct. Do not
                                   change answers on the exam without good reason. In general, change an answer only if you:
                                    discover that you did not read the question correctly, or
                                    find new or additional helpful information in another question.


                                   Pace Yourself
                                   Some people will finish the exam early and some will not have time to finish all the questions.
                                   Watch the time remaining carefully (it will be displayed on your computer screen) and pace
                                   yourself through the exam. In most cases, the questions are delivered on a bell curve of
                                   difficulty. That means the test starts and ends with easy questions. The middle 50% or so of
                                   the test contains more difficult questions than the first 25% and last 25%.

                                   Do not waste time dwelling on a question if you simply do not know the answer. Make the
                                   best guess you can, mark the question for Record for Review, and return to the question if
                                   time allows. Make sure that you have time to read all the questions so that you can record the
                                   answers you do know.


          THE EXAM

                               What Should I Take to the Exam?
                               Take one form of government-issued personal identification with your signature and
                               photograph. No personal items, food, or drinks (including coffee and water) are permitted
                               inside the testing room. Personal items include, but are not limited to, pens, pagers, cell
                               phones, watches, hats, nonmedical electronic devices, outerwear, purses, and wallets. Personal
                               items must be kept in your assigned locker or returned to your car before the start of your
                               exam. As the testing vendor is not responsible for any personal items, they encourage you to
                               bring only your identification into the center.

                               If you need additional note boards or pens, please alert your proctor. The note boards and
                               pens must be returned at the end of your exam session. Bathroom breaks are permitted, but
                               the clock will continue to run. Do not be surprised if a proctor accompanies you and “sweeps
                               the room clean” before you enter. FINRA and NASAA take test security seriously.

                               If you need a calculator for your testing session, please see the test center administrator. You
                               will be provided with a nonprogrammable, nonprinting calculator.


                               Exam Results and Reports
                               At the end of the exam, you will receive immediate notice of your success or failure. If your
                               attempt was not successful, the feedback will let you know and your score will be displayed.
                               Those passing the exam are not provided a score.

             INTRODUCTION
                                  Because equity is such an important capital market security, the fundamentals that you learn in
                                  this unit will lay the groundwork for your success in future units. This unit will cover common
                                  stock, preferred stock, and related equity securities.

                                  The investment world is divided between owners (stock, or equity securities) and lenders
                                  (bonds, or debt securities). Owning equity in a company is perhaps the most visible and
                                  accessible means by which wealth is created. Individual investors become owners of a publicly
                                  traded company by buying stock in that company. In so doing, they can participate in the
                                  company’s growth over time and, in many cases, receive a share of the company’s profits in the
                                  form of dividends.

          LESSON 1.1: EQUITY SECURITIES
                                       LO 1.a Describe the characteristics of equity securities.


                                       Characteristics of Equity Securities
                                       In the simplest terms, a security is an investment that represents either an ownership stake
                                       or a debt stake. An investor becomes part owner in a corporation by buying shares of the
                                       company’s stock. A debt security is usually acquired by buying an issuer’s (a corporation or a
                                       government) bonds. A debt investment is a loan to the issuer in exchange for interest income
                                       and the promise to repay the loan at a future maturity date. It does not confer ownership
                                       (equity) as does the purchase of stock.

                                       When investors become owners of a corporation by purchasing stock in that company, they
                                       can participate in the company’s prosperity by sharing in earnings through the receipt of
                                       dividends and, particularly in the case of common stock, benefit from an increase in the price
                                       of the shares.


                                       Common Stock
                                       Common stock is equity (ownership) in a corporation. A company issues stock to raise
                                       capital, and investors who buy the stock are buying a share of ownership in the company. The
                                       exam will deal with stock that has been issued to the public. That process will be explained
                                       in Unit 8. In Unit 7, we will show you that whatever a business owns (its assets) less its
                                       creditors’ claims (its liabilities) is the net worth of the enterprise and belongs to the owners
                                       (its stockholders).

                                       Each share of stock entitles its owner to a portion of the company’s earnings and dividends
                                       and a proportionate vote in major management decisions. Most corporations are organized
                                       in such a way that their common stockholders regularly vote for and elect a few individuals
                                       to a board of directors to oversee company business. By electing a board of directors, these
                                       stockholders have a say in the company’s management but are not involved in the day-to-day
                                       details of its operations.

                                                    EXAMPLE
                                                    If a corporation issues 100 shares of stock, each share represents an identical 1/100—
                                                    or 1%—ownership position in the company. An investor who owns 10 shares of stock
                                                    would own 10% of the company; an investor who owns 50 shares of stock would own
                                                    50% of the company.

                                       Corporations may issue two types of stock: common and preferred. When speaking of stocks,
                                       people generally mean common stock. Preferred stock also represents equity (ownership)
                                       in a corporation but usually does not have the same voting rights or appreciation potential
                                       as common stock. Preferred stock normally pays a fixed dividend, usually quarterly, and has
                                       priority claims over common stock. That is, common stockholders cannot receive a dividend
                                       until the preferred shareholders have been paid theirs and, in the event the company goes
                                       bankrupt, preferred stockholders have a prior claim on any remaining assets.

                                  Preferred Stock
                                  Preferred stock is an equity security because it represents a class of ownership in the issuing
                                  corporation. However, it does share some characteristics with a debt security. As we will learn
                                  in the next unit, just as with debt securities, the rate of return on a preferred stock is fixed
                                  rather than subject to variation as with common stock. As a result, its price tends to fluctuate             Unit 1
                                  with changes in interest rates rather than with the issuing company’s business prospects unless,
                                  of course, dramatic changes occur in the company’s ability to pay dividends. This concept,
                                  known as interest rate or money rate risk, will be covered in the next unit as well as Unit 19.

                                            TAKE NOTE
                                            Unlike common stock, most preferred stock is nonvoting. Therefore, unless stated
                                            otherwise in a question, preferred stock doesn’t have voting rights.


                                            TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                            Like common stock, preferred stock represents ownership in a company, but its price
                                            reacts to the market more like a bond because, with its fixed dividend payment, it is
                                            price sensitive to interest rate changes.


                                            PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                 Holders of each of the following are creditors except
                                                  A. investors owning preferred stock.
                                                  B. investment companies owning corporate bonds.
                                                  C. corporations owning municipal bonds.
                                                  D. states owning U.S. government bonds.
                                                 Answer: A. Remember, all stockholders (even preferred stockholders), not creditors,
                                                 are owners of a corporation. When it comes to bonds, regardless of the nature of the
                                                 owner, it is always a debt security, and that makes the owners creditors.

                                  Common Stock Features
                                  Growth (Capital Gains)
                                  An increase in the market price of securities is capital appreciation. Historically, owning
                                  common stock has provided investors with returns in excess of the inflation rate. For this
                                  reason, most investors with a long-term investment horizon have included common stock in
                                  their portfolios as a hedge against inflation. Of course, it must be mentioned that stock prices
                                  can decline, particularly over the short run.

                                            EXAMPLE
                                            An investor bought shares of RST for $60 per share on January 1, 2022. On
                                            December 31, 2022, the shares were worth $90, an increase of 50% in the market price.

          4          Unit 1   Types and Characteristics of Equity Securities



                                       Income
                                       Many corporations pay regular quarterly cash dividends to stockholders. A company’s dividends,
                                       in the case of common stock, may increase over time as profitability increases. Dividends, which
                                       can be a significant source of income for investors, are a major reason many people invest in stocks.
                                       Because stock is an equity security, unlike interest payments on debt, dividends are not obligatory
                                       and are declared at the discretion of the company’s board of directors.

                                       Issuers may also pay stock dividends in additional shares of common stock in the issuing
                                       company, or property dividends, shares in a subsidiary company, or in company products.

                                                    EXAMPLE
                                                    RST paid a dividend of $2 per share during 2022, which provided the investor with a
                                                    dividend yield of 3.3% ($2 ÷ $60 = 3.33%) in addition to the $30 price appreciation.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    The increase in the price of RST stock in the example above is an unrealized gain
                                                    until the stock is sold; when the stock is sold, the price increase becomes a realized
                                                    gain. Capital gains are not taxed until they are realized. Under current tax law, most
                                                    dividends and long-term capital gains are taxed at a rate not in excess of 15%. Taxation
                                                    will be covered in more detail in Unit 15.

                                       Definition: stock dividend. One option a corporation has is to pay common stockholders a
                                       dividend in additional shares of the stock. This saves the cash that would be used in a normal
                                       dividend while giving stockholders something at no cost. For example, if an investor owned
                                       100 shares of the stock and the company declared a 20% stock dividend, that investor would
                                       receive 20 additional shares, bringing the total holding up to 120 shares. There are two
                                       important facts to know:
                                       1. As a result of the additional shares being distributed where the company receives no new
                                          money, the price of the stock will drop so that the overall value remains the same. Using
                                          our numbers from above, if, prior to the distribution, the market price was $48 per share,
                                          the investor has $4,800 worth of stock. After the stock dividend is paid, the investor still
                                          has $4,800 of stock, but now owns 120 shares. That would make the current market price
                                          approximately $40 per share ($4,800 divided by 120).
                                       2. Stock dividends are not taxed when received. As you will learn in Unit 15, they are not
                                          taxed until sold and have the effect of reducing the investor’s cost basis per share.

                                       Do not confuse a stock dividend with a stock split. A split is an accounting process whereby
                                       the corporation exchanges new shares for old ones while changing the number of shares
                                       outstanding in the marketplace. For example, in a 2-for-1 stock split, the investor now owns
                                       twice as many shares worth half as much each. Conceptually, it is the same as changing large
                                       bills for small ones. If you had a $20 bill and changed it for two $10 bills, in essence, you’ve
                                       just had a 2-for-1 split. Do you have any more money? No, just two bills worth the same as
                                       the previous one. If you changed your $20 bill for four $5 bills, it would be the equivalent of
                                       a 4-for-1 split.


                                       Rights of Stockholders
                                       As mentioned earlier, common stockholders have the right to vote for the corporation’s board
                                       of directors at the corporation’s annual meeting. Stock, whether common or preferred, is
                                       freely transferable (permission of the company is not required) to anyone who wants to buy




01_0-2532_LEM_65E_Unit01.indd 4                                                                                                                28/10/22 11:23 AM
                                                                              Unit 1   Types and Characteristics of Equity Securities     5


                                  it or receive it as a gift. Without this feature, there would be no stock markets. The owner
                                  (or broker-dealer holding the stock) sends the stock certificate to the issuer’s transfer agent
                                  with instructions to issue a certificate in the new owner’s name. The concept is similar to
                                  transferring title when you sell a car. Because of the opportunities for fraud, transfer agents
                                  (usually large commercial banks) must be registered as such with the Securities and Exchange
                                  Commission (SEC) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Shareholders also have the                       Unit 1
                                  right to receive an audited set of financial statements of the company’s performance each year
                                  (annual reports). Common, but not preferred, stockholders usually have the preemptive right
                                  to maintain their proportionate share of ownership in the corporation. The word preempt
                                  means to put oneself in front of another. We will have a further discussion on preemptive
                                  rights in Unit 4.

                                            PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                 Which of the following statements regarding rights is true?
                                                  A. Common stockholders would not generally receive preemptive rights.
                                                  B. Preferred stockholders would not generally receive preemptive rights.
                                                  C. Both common and preferred stockholders would generally receive preemptive
                                                      rights.
                                                  D. Neither common nor preferred stockholders would generally receive
                                                      preemptive rights.
                                                 Answer: B. Preferred stockholders have no right to maintain a percentage of
                                                 ownership when new shares are issued (no preemptive rights). However, they do
                                                 receive preference in dividend payment and company liquidation.


                                            TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                            Prior to a vote or a payment of dividend, the company establishes a record date. This
                                            is the date by which an investor must be an owner of record (shown as an owner on
                                            the company’s records) in order to vote or receive the announced dividend.


                                  Limited Liability
                                  One of the most important features of equity ownership (common stock or preferred stock) is
                                  limited liability. In the event of the bankruptcy of a corporation, when corporate assets are
                                  not adequate to meet corporate obligations, the stockholder’s personal assets are not at risk.
                                  One cannot be forced to sell any personal assets to help pay the debts of the business.

                                  An individual investing $5,000 in the stock (common or preferred) of a corporation that goes
                                  bankrupt may lose the entire $5,000 if the company is not salvaged but will not be forced to
                                  pay out any more money to take care of the corporation’s debts. That investor is personally at
                                  risk only for the amount that was invested. This is different from a business organized as a sole
                                  proprietorship or partnership, where the owner’s personal assets are placed at risk should the
                                  business not be able to pay off its obligations. This concept will be discussed later, in Unit 16.


                                  Liquidity
                                  In almost all cases, shares of common and preferred stock are freely transferrable. That means
                                  that shareholders do not need the permission of the issuer, or anyone else, in order to sell their
                                  stock in the open market. This is especially true in the case of shares traded on the major stock
                                  exchanges. One exception is restricted stock (covered shortly) where sales are contingent upon
                                  meeting the requirements of SEC Rule 144.

                                       Benefits and Risks of Owning Common Stock
                                       Regardless of their expectations, investors have no assurances that they will receive the returns
                                       they expect from their investments, so the risks must be balanced against the rewards.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    In owning common equity, the investor stands to lose current income through
                                                    dividend reduction or suspension, as well as capital loss, should the market price
                                                    decline. In return, however, the shareholder has limited liability; that is, the liability is
                                                    limited to the amount invested and theoretically unlimited potential for future price
                                                    appreciation and/or dividend growth.

                                       By including common stock in a portfolio, the client would be incurring the following risks:


                                       Market Risk
                                       The chance that a stock will decline in price is one risk of owning common stock (known
                                       as market risk). A stock’s price fluctuates daily as perceptions of the company’s business
                                       prospects change and influence the actions of buyers and sellers. Investors have no assurance
                                       whatsoever that they will be able to recoup the investment in a stock at any time.


                                       Business Risk
                                       A risk of common stock ownership is the possibility of a decline in the company’s earnings.
                                       This could lead to a reduction or even elimination of the dividend.


                                       Low Priority at Dissolution
                                       If a company enters bankruptcy, the holders of its bonds and preferred stock have priority
                                       over common stockholders. A company’s debt and preferred shares are considered senior
                                       securities. Common stockholders have residual rights to corporate assets upon dissolution.

                                                          Answer: A. An advantage of owning stock is that an investor’s liability is limited to

                                  LO 1.c Recognize the different types of preferred stock.

                                  There are several different types of preferred stock, starting with straight preferred (think
                                  of “plain vanilla”) and expanding depending on which and how many adjectives we use to
                                  describe the security. However, all maintain preference over common stock. Remember,                          Unit 1
                                  preferred stock is an equity security and, just as with common stock, dividends are paid at the
                                  discretion of the board of directors. Because, with one exception noted below, those dividends
                                  are fixed, many investment professionals consider this a fixed-income investment for asset
                                  allocation purposes. Those dividends are either a stated amount ($6 preferred) or a percentage
                                  or par value ($100 par, 6% preferred). What is special about preferred stock is that a dividend
                                  can never be paid to the common stockholders unless the preferred is satisfied first. Preferred
                                  stock may have one or more of the following characteristics:


                                  Straight (Noncumulative)
                                  Straight preferred stock has no special features beyond the stated dividend payment. Missed
                                  dividends are not paid to the stockholder.


                                  Cumulative Preferred
                                  Cumulative preferred stock accrues payments due its shareholders in the event dividends
                                  are reduced or suspended. Dividends due cumulative preferred stock accumulate on the
                                  company’s books until the corporation’s board of directors decides to pay them. When the
                                  company resumes dividend payments, cumulative preferred stockholders receive current
                                  dividends plus the total accumulated dividends—dividends in arrears—before any dividends
                                  may be distributed to common stockholders.

                                             EXAMPLE
                                             In 2016, RST Corp. had both common stock and cumulative preferred stock
                                             outstanding. For the year, the common stock paid total dividends of $1, and the total
                                             preferred dividend was $2. Because of financial difficulties, the company stopped
                                             paying dividends after 2016. Having resolved its problems in 2021, the company
                                             resumed dividend payments and paid the cumulative preferred holders an $8
                                             dividend for the arrearage in years 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2020 plus the current year’s
                                             (2021) $2 dividend before paying any dividends to the common stockholders.

                                             TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                             Because of this unique feature found only with cumulative preferred stock, an investor
                                             seeking steady income would find this to be the most suitable of the different types of
                                             preferred stock.


                                  Callable Preferred
                                  Corporations often issue callable (or redeemable) preferred stock, which a company can buy
                                  back from investors at a stated price after a specified date. The right to call the stock allows the
                                  company to replace a relatively high fixed dividend obligation with a lower one when the cost
                                  of money has gone down. This is similar to refinancing a mortgage.

          8          Unit 1   Types and Characteristics of Equity Securities



                                       When a corporation calls a preferred stock, dividend payments cease on the call date. In
                                       return for the call privilege, the corporation may pay a premium exceeding the stock’s
                                       par value at the call, such as $103 for a $100 par value stock. Issuing the call can create a
                                       problem for your client who purchased callable preferred shares issued at a time when market
                                       conditions dictated relatively high dividend rates. If the cost of new money comes down, the
                                       company will call in the preferred and the investor will now have to reinvest the proceeds at a
                                       lower rate. This is an example of reinvestment risk.

                                       Having the call price at a premium over par is one way to compensate for this additional risk
                                       (and inconvenience). Another is that the dividend rate on callable preferred stock is generally
                                       a bit higher than other preferred stock issued by the corporation.


                                       Convertible Preferred
                                       A preferred stock is convertible if the owner can exchange the shares for a fixed number of
                                       shares of common stock of the issuing corporation.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    Because the value of a convertible preferred stock is linked to the value of a common
                                                    stock, the convertible’s preferred price tends to fluctuate in line with that of the common.

                                       Convertible preferred is generally issued with a lower stated dividend rate than nonconvertible
                                       preferred of the same quality because the investor may have the opportunity to convert to
                                       common shares and enjoy greater capital gain potential. This feature can have the effect
                                       of reducing the interest rate risk. The concept of a convertible security will be discussed in
                                       greater detail later in the next unit when we cover convertible bonds.


                                       Adjustable-Rate Preferred
                                       Some preferred stocks are issued with adjustable (or variable) dividend rates. Such dividends
                                       are usually tied to the rates of other interest rate benchmarks, such as Treasury bills and
                                       money market rates, and can be adjusted as often as monthly. The decision as to the frequency
                                       of adjustment is that of the issuing corporation and is not a testable topic. Because the
                                       payment adjusts to current interest rates, the price of the stock remains relatively stable. This
                                       adjustability tends to reduce interest rate risk when compared to other preferred shares.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    For investors looking for fixed income through preferred stocks, adjustable rate would
                                                    be their least appropriate choice because the dividend will likely fluctuate.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    A preferred stock could be cumulative and callable, callable and convertible, or any
                                                    combination of these adjectives. If none are listed, it is just a straight preferred.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    Because the primary objective met by investing in preferred stock is income, when
                                                    analyzing a specific preferred stock, the most important determination should be the
                                                    ability of the company to meet its dividend payments.

                                                 An investor who has purchased preferred stock with the goal of receiving steady
                                                 quarterly income would be most interested in the
                                                  A. seniority of the stock compared to other securities.

                                                  C. voting power of the shares.
                                                  D. par value of the shares.
                                                 Answer: B. Investors in preferred stock with the goal of income are most concerned
                                                 that the company will be able to sustain the dividend, making choice B the correct
                                                 answer. For exam purposes, all preferred stock is nonvoting, and it makes no
                                                 difference if the par value is $10, $25, or $100 because the dividend is fixed as a
                                                 percentage return. The fact that the preferred stock has seniority over the common
                                                 is important, but that concept is included in the ability of the company to pay its
                                                 dividend.

                                            TAKE NOTE
                                            Although it is generally regarded as a fixed-income investment, preferred stock, unlike
                                            debt securities, usually has no preset date at which it matures and no scheduled
                                            redemption date. Preferred stock is thus a perpetual security.

          LESSON 1.2: SPECIAL TYPES OF EQUITY SECURITIES
                                       Most of the questions on the exam deal with securities purchased by investors. There are,
                                       however, a few questions where stock in a corporation is purchased from the company by its
                                       employees through the granting of stock options.


                                       LO 1.d Describe how incentive stock options differ from nonqualified
                                       stock options.

                                       Employee stock options offer employees the right to purchase a specified number of shares
                                       of the common stock of their employer at a stated price over a stated time period. Unlike
                                       qualified retirement plans (discussed in Unit 18), there are no nondiscrimination requirements
                                       for these plans. For publicly traded stock, the strike price (also called the grant or exercise
                                       price) is usually the market price of the stock at the time the option is granted. In most cases,
                                       there is a minimum time the employee must remain with the company in order to be able
                                       to use the option (the vesting period). The hope of the employee is that the market price of
                                       the employer’s stock will increase in value. Then, the employee will be able to purchase the
                                       stock by exercising the option (purchasing the stock) at the lower strike price and then sell
                                       the stock at the current market price. There are two principal kinds of stock option programs,
                                       each with its own rules and tax consequences: nonqualified stock options (NSOs or NQSOs)
                                       and incentive stock options (ISOs). Don’t confuse these with publicly traded puts and calls
                                       described later in Unit 4—these are available only to employees of the issuing company. Most
                                       states require that the stock option plan be approved by the board of directors.


                                       Nonqualified Stock Options (NSOs)
                                       These are the more common of the two varieties of employee stock options. NSOs are
                                       basically treated as a form of compensation. When NSOs are exercised, the difference between
                                       the current market price at the time of exercise and the strike price, referred to as the bargain
                                       element, is reported as wages on the tax returns of the employer and the employee. Therefore,




01_0-2532_LEM_65E_Unit01.indd 10                                                                                                                 28/10/22 11:23 AM
                                                                                 Unit 1   Types and Characteristics of Equity Securities   11


                                   instead of capital gains treatment, the employee is taxed as ordinary income on that bargain
                                   element while the company receives a tax deduction as salary expense for that same amount.

                                             EXAMPLE
                                             An employee exercises an NSO at $52 per share when the current fair value of the                     Unit 1
                                             stock is $66.50. The bargain element is $14.50 per share (the difference between the
                                             exercise price of $52 and the fair value of $66.50). If the exercise was for 100 shares, this
                                             employee will report $1,450 as ordinary income for the year, and the corporation treats
                                             that as deductible salary expense. When that stock is sold, the employee’s cost basis is
                                             the total of the exercise price plus the already taxed salary.

                                             TAKE NOTE
                                             Because the spread between the market price and the strike price is considered salary,
                                             it is subject to payroll taxes as well as income tax.


                                   Incentive Stock Options (ISOs)
                                   Unlike the NSO, there are generally no tax consequences to the employer with an ISO, but,
                                   if done properly, they can be more advantageous to the employee than NSOs. As mentioned
                                   above, the employee’s profits from NSOs are taxed as ordinary income. However, as long
                                   as stock purchased through exercise of an ISO is held at least two years after the date of the
                                   grant and one year after the date of exercise, any profits are reported as long-term capital
                                   gains. If these time limits are broached, the ISO is taxed like an NSO. There is one other time
                                   stipulation—there is a maximum 10-year limit for exercise.

                                   But there is a catch. When an ISO is exercised, the difference between the market value at the
                                   time of purchase and the strike price is a preference item used in calculating the alternative
                                   minimum tax (AMT) (covered in Unit 15).

                                   Incentive Stock Options (ISOs)
                                   No income recognized when option is granted
                                   No tax due when option is exercised
                                   Tax is due when stock is sold
                                   ■■ Gain is capital (long term) if held at least one year and sold at least two years after grant
                                   ■■ Otherwise, ordinary income
                                   Difference between option price and the fair market value (FMV) on date of exercise is an add back
                                   for AMT purposes


                                             EXAMPLE
                                             Julie’s employer grants her an incentive stock option (ISO) on January 1, 2012, with an
                                             exercise (strike) price of $25 per share. Julie exercises the option on January 1, 2013,
                                             when the market price of the stock is $40 per share. Because this is an ISO and the
                                             stock has not yet been sold, there is no “salary” income or capital gains taxation. There
                                             is a $15 per share adjustment for purposes of computing the AMT (the bargain element
                                             difference between $25 and $40), but it is unlikely that the exam will ask anything
                                             beyond knowing that ISOs can be subject to AMT.
                                             Julie sells the stock two years later for $60 per share. Now that the sale has been
                                             recognized and Julie has followed the required holding periods, the $35 per share
                                             profit is taxed as a long-term capital gain. There will also be an adjustment to the AMT,
                                             but that is beyond the scope of the exam.

                                       LO 1.e Contrast restricted stock and nonrestricted stock.

                                       At the beginning of this unit, we stated that one of the characteristics of stock is that it is
                                       freely transferable. That is, once purchased, it may be sold (or gifted) at any time to anyone.
                                       As is the case with most of this course, there are exceptions. The two that are testable deal with
                                       the sale of stock that is restricted and the stock owned by control persons.

                                       In Unit 8 of this course, we will discuss the exemption from registration for securities sold as
                                       part of a private placement (the limited offering exemption). In general, retail investors cannot
                                       sell these securities until having held them for a certain period of time; they are restricted
                                       from immediate resale and, therefore, are referred to as restricted securities. The length of
                                       that restriction is generally 6 months, and there are volume restrictions as well that apply to
                                       those who are affiliates of the issuer. You probably will not be tested on those; just know that
                                       restricted stock has a time limit for all investors and may also have a volume limit for affiliates
                                       on the amount that may be resold.

                                       The other case is with control stock. Control stock is stock held by a control person.
                                       What makes it control stock is who owns it, not how it was acquired. For purposes of this
                                       discussion, a control person is a corporate director, an officer, a large stockholder, or the
                                       immediate family of any of the preceding residing in the same home. They are generally
                                       referred to as affiliates because of their unique status within the issuer. In general, purchases
                                       and sales of control stock must be reported to the SEC. Control stock always has volume
                                       limits (those numbers are not tested).

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    For testing purposes, assume that ownership consisting of 10% or more of the voting
                                                    stock is considered control.


                                       The mechanism for reporting the sale of control stock as well as the sale of restricted stock
                                       is found in SEC Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933. SEC Rule 144 was created so that
                                       certain resales of already existing securities could be made without having to file a complete
                                       registration statement with the SEC. The time and money involved in having to file such a
                                       registration are usually so prohibitive as to make it uneconomical for the individual seller. In
                                       almost all cases, those who wish to sell control stock or restricted stock must do so by filing a
                                       Form 144.

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                          An investor owns 15% of the stock of a publicly traded company. This investor’s
                                                          spouse owns 5% of the stock of the same company. If the spouse wishes to sell the
                                                          shares representing that 5% ownership, which of the following statements are true?
                                                             I. Both the investor and the spouse are control persons.
                                                            II. The investor is a control person, while the spouse is not.
                                                           III. The spouse must file a Form 144.
                                                           IV. The investor must file a Form 144.

                                                  Answer: A. The investor’s 15% ownership is control. Rule 144 includes in the
                                                  definition of control person “any relative or spouse of such person, or any relative of
                                                  such spouse, any one of whom has the same home as such person.” Unless stated
                                                  to the contrary, the assumption on the exam is that spouses reside together, making
                                                  both of them control persons. All sales of control stock (unless an exemption applies)
                                                  must be accompanied by a Rule 144 filing on Form 144 by the selling party. Although             Unit 1
                                                  both are control persons, the spouse is the only one selling and, therefore, the one
                                                  required to file.


                                             KNOWLEDGE CHECK 1.2
                                             1.   Four years ago, Susan was granted enough nonqualified stock options (NQSOs)

                                                   A. It must be held a minimum of one year before resale.
                                                   B. Sales must be accompanied by Form R.
                                                   C. Volume limits generally apply to sales by control (affiliated) persons.

             LESSON 1.3: FOREIGN EQUITY SECURITIES

                                   LO 1.f Identify the unique features of American depositary receipts
                                   (ADRs) and the risks of investing in foreign securities.


                                   American Depositary Receipts (ADRs)
                                   ADRs, also known as American depositary shares (ADSs), facilitate the trading of foreign
                                   stocks in U.S. markets because everything is done in English and in U.S. dollars. ADRs are
                                   bought and sold (traded) in U.S. dollars, and dividends are paid out in U.S. dollars.
                                   An ADR is a negotiable security that represents a receipt for shares of stock in a
                                   non-U.S. corporation. ADRs are bought and sold in the U.S. securities markets like any
                                   domestic stock.

                                   An ADR may represent the underlying shares on a one-for-one basis or may represent a
                                   fraction of a share or multiple shares. For example, for one company, an ADR may represent
                                   several shares of the underlying security, while for another company, an ADR may represent a
                                   fraction of the underlying security. The use of a ratio, or participation rate, allows ADRs to be
                                   priced at an amount more typical of U.S. market share prices.

                                                    EXAMPLE
                                                    At the time of this printing, one U.S. dollar (USD) was worth about 5.5 Brazilian reals
                                                    (BRs). A Brazilian corporation’s ADRs might be structured on a ratio of 1:5. That is, each
                                                    ADR is equivalent to owning five shares of the underlying stock. Therefore, if the ADR
                                                    was trading at $10, the investor would be paying approximately 55 BRs for five shares
                                                    of the Brazilian stock. The math is not tested; only the concept that ratios other than
                                                    1:1 exist with some ADRs is tested.


                                       Rights of ADR Owners
                                       Most of the rights that common stockholders normally hold, such as the right to receive
                                       dividends, also apply to ADR owners. In some, but not all, cases, there are also voting rights.
                                       For purposes of the exam, ADRs never have preemptive rights.


                                       Risks of ADRs
                                       In addition to the normal risks associated with stock ownership, ADR investors are also
                                       subject to currency risk. Currency risk is the possibility that an investment denominated in
                                       one currency (such as the Mexican peso) could decline if the value of that currency declines in
                                       its exchange rate with the U.S. dollar. Because ADRs represent shares of stock in companies
                                       located in foreign countries, currency exchange rates are an important consideration.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    The banks collect the dividend payments, convert them into U.S. funds for
                                                    U.S. owners, and withhold any required foreign tax payments. Owners of ADRs can
                                                    claim a U.S. tax credit for these withholdings.


                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    The exam will want you to know that ADRs are issued by domestic branches of
                                                    U.S. banks and that, even though they are traded in U.S. dollars, they still bear
                                                    currency risk.


                                       Investing in Foreign Markets
                                       Although foreign securities offer investors the potential for substantial gains, they bear a
                                       variety of risks that are not present with domestic investments. There are two broad market
                                       classifications of foreign markets: emerging and developed.


                                       Emerging Markets
                                       Emerging markets are markets in less-developed countries. They are generally associated
                                       with:
                                        low levels of income, as measured by the country’s gross domestic product (GDP);
                                        low levels of equity capitalization;
                                        questionable market liquidity;
                                        potential restrictions on currency conversion;
                                        high volatility;

                                    high taxes and commission costs for foreign investors;

                                                                                                                                                Unit 1
                                    restrictions on foreign ownership and on foreign currency conversion; and
                                    lower regulatory standards resulting in a lack of transparency.
                                   Despite primitive market infrastructures, many emerging markets have rapid growth rates
                                   that make their securities attractive to foreign investors whose local markets experience more
                                   modest growth.

                                             TAKE NOTE
                                             There is a term that has not yet appeared on the exam but may during the life of this
                                             edition. That term is frontier market. One could say that frontier markets are to
                                             emerging markets as emerging markets are to developed ones. The risks here are
                                             extremely high.


                                   Developed Markets
                                   Developed markets are those associated with countries that have highly developed economies
                                   with stable political and social institutions. These are characterized by:
                                    large levels of equity capitalization;
                                    low commission rates;
                                    few, if any, currency conversion restrictions;
                                    highly liquid markets with many brokerage institutions and market makers;
                                    many large capitalization securities; and
                                    well-defined regulatory schemes leading to transparency similar to that enjoyed by those
                                      investing in U.S. securities.

                                   In sumamation, why would you include foreign securities in a client’s portfolio?
                                    You have expanded the potential investment universe leading to greater diversification.
                                    Foreign securities sometimes outperform domestic ones.
                                    Foreign securities are usually not highly correlated with domestic ones (correlation will be
                                      covered in Unit 20), and, as a result, the overall risk of the portfolio is reduced.


                                   Risks of Investing in Foreign Markets
                                   In doing so, whether investing in the securities of emerging or developed foreign markets, the
                                   investor faces, in addition to the normal risks involved in investing, the following risks not
                                   present in domestic investing:

                                       include political risks, such as revolutions or military coups; and structural risks, such as
                                       confiscatory policies toward profits, capital gains, and dividends. Economic policies, interest
                                       rates, and inflation are also elements of risk of investing in emerging countries.


                                       Exchange Controls
                                       Foreign investors can also be subject to restrictions on currency conversion or movement.


                                       Withholding, Fees, and Taxes
                                       Some foreign countries may withhold a portion of dividends and capital gains for taxes.
                                       Some also impose heavy fees and taxes on securities that the investor must bear in addition to
                                       generally higher brokerage commissions.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    We will return to some of these risks again in Unit 19.

             INTRODUCTION
                                   In addition to raising capital through the issuance of equity securities (stock), many
                                   corporations fund their business efforts through borrowing by issuing debt securities. Long-term
                                   borrowing is usually in the form of bonds and unsecured debt instruments (debentures, covered
                                   at LO 2.g), while cash equivalents, such as commercial paper and Treasury bills, are the primary
                                   source of short-term financing for corporations and the U.S. government. Governmental bodies
                                   can only issue debt securities (you cannot buy stock in the U.S. Treasury or your state).

          LESSON 2.1: BONDS AS FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES
                                       Debt capital represents money loaned to an issuer by investors purchasing that issuer’s bonds.
                                       A bond represents the issuer’s indebtedness. An investor purchasing a bond is lending the
                                       issuer money for a set period of time at a fixed annual interest rate. That rate is frequently
                                       referred to as the coupon rate because, years ago, bonds were issued with detachable coupons
                                       that were presented for collection of the interest. That is no longer the case, but the term
                                       coupon is still in common use.

                                       There are three major issuers of debt securities. The largest issuer of debt securities is the
                                       U.S. government. Corporations issue bonds to finance their operations, and substantial sums
                                       are also borrowed by state governments and those political entities that are subdivisions of a
                                       state, such as cities, counties, towns, and so forth. These issues from state and local political
                                       entities are called municipal bonds.

                                       Let us begin this adventure by explaining the characteristics common to most bonds.


                                       LO 2.a Recognize the characteristics common to most bonds.

                                       There is, in essence, a contract between the borrower (the issuer) and the lender (the investor).
                                       The terms of the loan are expressed in a document known as the bond’s indenture. The
                                       indenture, sometimes also referred to as the deed of trust, states the issuer’s obligation to
                                       pay back a specific amount of money on a specific date. The indenture also states the issuer’s
                                       obligation to pay the investor a specific rate of interest for the use of the funds as well as any
                                       collateral pledged as security for the loan and all other pertinent details.

                                       It is important to understand that debt capital refers to long-term debt financing. Long-term
                                       debt is money borrowed for a minimum of 5 years, although more frequently the length of
                                       time is 10–30 years.


                                       Bond Characteristics
                                       Inverse Relationship Between Interest Rates and the Price of Debt
                                       Securities
                                       In the previous unit, we mentioned that the market price of preferred stock fluctuates
                                       inversely with current interest rates. Later on in this unit, when we discuss the math behind
                                       yields, this topic will be easier to follow. At this point, we want you to know that whenever
                                       interest rates in the market (the current cost of borrowing money) go up, the price of
                                       outstanding debt securities goes down. Likewise, if interest rates fall, the price of outstanding
                                       debt securities will rise. That is what interest rate risk is all about.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    Although the market price of the debt security will fluctuate, the interest payments
                                                    stay the same.

                                   Negotiability
                                   Like stock, bonds are readily transferrable. This enables investors to sell their bonds before
                                   maturity date. As just stated with interest rate risk, the price received may be more or less
                                   than the face value. Other factors can also come into play, such as a change in the safety of the
                                   bond (this will be covered when we get to ratings).


                                   Specified Maturity Date
                                   Debt securities are redeemed (paid back) by the issuer on a specified maturity date. In the case
                                   of money market instruments, that can be as short as one day. It is never longer than 1 year.
                                   Bonds have longer maturities. As previously stated, those can be as short as 5 years, but more
                                   often are 10–30 years.


                                   Payment of Interest
                                   In the case of bonds, interest is generally paid semiannually based on a stated coupon rate.                 Unit 2
                                   Unlike dividends on stock, which are determined by the company’s board of directors and can
                                   be skipped or reduced if financial conditions are unfavorable, interest on debt securities is an
                                   obligation. Failure to pay the interest (or principal) as scheduled could lead to foreclosure or
                                   bankruptcy proceedings. No company ever went bankrupt because it could not pay a dividend
                                   on its equity securities. Just like individuals, failure to meet your debt obligations can lead to
                                   real trouble. Another important fact about interest: in the case of corporate debt, it is a pre-tax
                                   expense, deductible from income like the interest on your home mortgage—unlike dividends,
                                   which are paid from net income (after tax).

                                   In the case of money market instruments, they are issued at a discount to their face value with
                                   the difference paid at maturity representing the interest. In Lesson 2.7, we will get into more
                                   detail on this.


                                   Accrued Interest
                                   What happens to an investor who sells a bond before the semiannual interest payment
                                   date? The buyer pays the seller the amount of interest that has accrued since the last interest
                                   payment. Then, on the next payment date, the new owner receives the full six months of
                                   interest.

                                   Most bonds trade and interest, meaning a buyer pays a seller a bond’s market price plus any
                                   accrued interest since the last interest payment. The buyer receives the full amount of the next
                                   interest payment, including interest that accrued while the seller owned the bond.

                                   Rating Services
                                   The purchase of a debt security is only as safe as the strength of the borrower. Also taken into
                                   account is the presence or absence of any collateral (just as when you want to borrow money).
                                   Because safety of the bond will frequently be a very important consideration for clients, most
                                   investors consult the rating services. The two primary rating organizations for debt securities
                                   are Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s. Both organizations have highly qualified personnel who
                                   analyze all the details of the debt issue and arrive at a letter rating indicating their opinion of

                                       Investment-Grade Debt
                                       In the industry, bonds rated in the top four categories (BBB or Baa and higher) are referred
                                       to as investment grade. Investment-grade bonds are generally the only quality eligible for
                                       purchase by institutions (e.g., banks or insurance companies) and by fiduciaries and therefore
                                       have greater liquidity than lower-grade instruments.


                                       High-Yield Bonds
                                       Lower-grade bonds, known in the industry as junk bonds, are now more commonly called
                                       high-yield bonds. Because of their lower ratings (BB or Ba or lower) and additional risk of
                                       default, high-yield bonds may be subject to substantial price erosion during slow economic
                                       times or when a bond issuer’s creditworthiness is questioned. Their volatility is usually
                                       substantially higher than investment-grade bonds, but they may be suitable for sophisticated
                                       investors seeking higher returns and possible capital appreciation from speculative
                                       fixed-income investments.

                                   There is a critical relationship in all investments known as the risk-reward relationship.
                                   The more risk an investor takes, the greater must be the reward. The less creditworthy the
                                   borrower, the more risk to the lender, so the greater the reward the lender must receive to
                                   compensate for that risk. That is why lower-rated bonds carry higher rates of return. The
                                   higher the rating, the greater likelihood that interest and principal will be paid as scheduled.
                                   Lower ratings indicate the amount of default or credit risk being taken by the investor. Think
                                   of the ratings as reflecting the borrower’s credit score, just like yours. For example, a triple
                                   A rating would be equivalent of a score in the 800’s, while a BB (or Ba) rating might be
                                   somewhat lower than 600.

                                   It is important to understand that when the raters evaluate a bond, they look at all the factors,
                                   including collateral. A mortgage bond is not necessarily safer than any debenture.

                                                  Answer: D. Choice A would be correct if the question referred to Moody’s.

                                             TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                             What does it mean when a bond’s rating comes under review? This is essentially the
                                             same concept as a review of your personal credit rating. Sometimes, it is just routine
                                             because the rating hasn’t been reviewed in some time. More often, certain factors have
                                             arisen causing concern as to the ability of the issuer to perform.

                                                   B. Bond prices have a direct relationship to interest rates.
                                                   C. The par value of a bond will increase as market interest rates fall.
                                                   D. The par value of a bond will decrease as market interest rates fall.

          LESSON 2.2: BOND MATH
                                       The securities industry is about numbers, and debt securities involve more than their share.
                                       You will need to know how to figure the price of a debt security. Following that, you will
                                       learn how to arrive at the parity price of a convertible security. The final math deals with
                                       determining yield based on that price and calculating the various yields used in the bond
                                       marketplace.


                                       LO 2.c Calculate the price of a bond.

                                       It is important to understand how the market prices of bonds are quoted. Look at the
                                       following examples to see how corporate, municipal, and government bonds are quoted.
                                       Remember, par or face value is always $1,000.


                                       Pricing Corporate and Municipal Bonds
                                       Corporate and municipal bonds are quoted as a percentage of par. Each bond point (1% of
                                       $1,000) represents $10, and the fractions are in eighths: each 1/8 = $1.25.
                                        A bond quoted at 90 1/4= $902.50 (90% * $1,000 = $900 + 1/4 * $10 [$2.50] = $902.50).
                                        A bond quoted at 101 3/4 = $1,017.50 (101% * $1,000 = $1,010 + 3/4 * $10 [$7.50] =
                                          $1,017.50).

                                       Government bonds are quoted as a percentage of par.
                                        Each point is $10, and each 0.1 represents 1/32 of $10 ($.3125). A government bond
                                          quoted at 90.8 (or 90.08) = $902.50 (90% * $1,000 = $900 + 8/32 [which is 1/4)] * $10
                                          [$2.50] = $902.50).
                                        A government bond quoted at 101.24 = $1,017.50 (101% * $1,000 = $1,010 + 24/32
                                          [which is 3/4] * $10 [$7.50] = $1,017.50).

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    In recent years, some quote systems have added a 0 for prices between .1 and .9 to
                                                    avoid confusion (similar to the way you enter the expiration date for your credit card
                                                    as “01/2024” instead of “1/2024.” That is why, in the example above, we show you both
                                                    90.8 and 90.08—they both mean 90 8/32.

                                                    EXAMPLE
                                                    When you see a corporate bond quoted at 103 1/2 it represents a market price of
                                                    $1,035. The 103 is 103% of $1,000, or $1,030, and the 1/2 is half of a $10 point, or $5.
                                                    On a Treasury bond, that same price would be shown as 103.16, where the .16 is 16/32
                                                    or 1/2.

                                   What does that mean? The DEF is the issuer, the 5 is the nominal or coupon rate, the 35 is
                                   the maturity date of 2035, and the 106 is the price ($1,060). So, what is the “s”? It is nothing
                                   but a separation between the coupon and the maturity date.



                                   LO 2.d Calculate the parity price of a convertible bond.


                                   Convertible Debt Securities
                                   The exam deals with securities that have a convertible feature. Although there may be
                                   a question on a convertible preferred stock, most of the parity questions will deal with
                                   convertible debt. Convertible debt, most often debentures, is issued by corporations only.
                                   Because they may be converted or exchanged for the company’s common stock, there are
                                   no convertible municipal or government bonds. The conversion privilege is exercised at the
                                   discretion of the investor. The ratio of conversion varies from one company’s bond to another               Unit 2
                                   according to the terms set forth in the indenture at the time the bonds are issued. The exact
                                   number of shares (or method of computing the number) that a particular bond will be
                                   convertible into at any point is printed in the bond indenture at the time of issue.

                                   In many cases, the indenture merely tells you the number of shares into which the bond is
                                   convertible. For example, the bond may be convertible into 50 shares; thus, it would have a
                                   conversion ratio of 50:1, or 50 shares for 1 bond. If a bond is convertible into 25 shares, it
                                   would have a conversion ratio of 25:1.

                                   Frequently, instead of telling the number of shares into which the bond is convertible, the
                                   indenture will give the conversion price. That conversion price is the price per share at which
                                   the corporation will sell their stock in exchange for the bond one is holding. Regardless of
                                   the current market price of the bond, the bond always represents a debt of the corporation
                                   of $1,000. Therefore, if the conversion price is given, to compute the number of shares into
                                   which the bond is convertible, always divide the par value ($1,000) by the conversion price.
                                   For example, a bond convertible at $20 per share is convertible into 50 shares ($1,000 ÷ $20
                                   = 50 shares).

                                   If the bond has a conversion price of $50, the conversion ratio is 20 shares ($1,000 ÷ $50 =
                                   20 shares). If the JRP 6s of ’41, currently selling at 120, were convertible at $40, how many
                                   shares would one get when one converted the bond? The answer is not 30. The current market
                                   has nothing to do with the computation. The bond conversion is fixed at issuance, and the
                                   market fluctuates all the time. The correct answer is 25 shares ($1,000 ÷ $40 = 25 shares).
                                   The comments we’ve made about convertible bonds (or convertible preferred) moving in
                                   relation to the underlying common stock is due to the concept of parity. According to the
                                   dictionary, when two things are at parity, they are equal. How does that work here? If you
                                   think about it, when holding a convertible security, we have a choice of two actions: we
                                   can either continue to hold the bond (or preferred), or we can decide to convert it into the
                                   common. If the convertible security and the common stock we would get upon conversion are
                                   worth the same, we say they are at parity.

                                             EXAMPLE
                                             On the exam, there may be questions on parity. Here are two methods to help you
                                             solve the problem.

                                                    RST debenture is convertible to common at $50. If an RST bond is currently trading for
                                                    $1,200, what is the parity price of the common?
                                                    Method One: Parity means equal. Solve for the conversion ratio as follows:
                                                    Par value: $1,000
                                                    Conversion price: $50
                                                    Conversion ratio: 20
                                                    The parity stock price is found by dividing $1,200 by 20. The parity price of the
                                                    common is $60. That is, if one were to convert the bond when the 20 shares received
                                                    have a market value of $60 each, the investor would have the same $1,200 as the
                                                    market value of the bond.
                                                    Method Two: If you prefer to think in percentages, identify that the current
                                                    debenture’s price of $1,200 is 20% greater than the original $1,000 price. To be at
                                                    equivalence, the stock price must also increase by 20%. So, add 20% to 50, and the
                                                    problem is solved. 20% of 50 is 10; 10 + 50 = parity price of $60.
                                                    Here is another style of parity question.
                                                    RST debenture is convertible to common at $50. If the common is trading for $45, what
                                                    is the parity price of the debenture? Start by solving for the conversion ratio.
                                                    Par value: $1,000
                                                    Conversion price: $50
                                                    Conversion ratio: 20
                                                    The debenture’s parity price is found by multiplying 20 × $45, which is $900. Using the
                                                    percentage method, you can determine that the market price of the common stock is
                                                    10% below that of the conversion price (5 ÷ 50 = 10%). Reducing the debenture price
                                                    of $1,000 by 10% results in a parity price of the debenture of $900.


                                       It is important to remember that parity is a theoretical concept—we’re looking for the price
                                       that would make the bond and stock “equal.” As a practical matter, convertible securities,
                                       whether debentures or preferred stock, almost always have a market price that is somewhat
                                       above the parity price. Conversely, the test might ask you to know that the stock trades
                                       generally a bit below the parity price.

                                       The nature of fixed income, usually being debt rather than equity, involves somewhat different
                                       methodology in determining proper valuation. After all, in most cases, these securities are
                                       purchased for their income rather than future capital appreciation. The first things we will
                                       look at are the various yield computations that are applicable to debt securities.


                                       Yield Computations
                                       The interest rate will always be stated as a percentage of the par value. The interest stated on
                                       the face of the bond is called the nominal yield. Sometimes it is referred to as the coupon
                                       rate. To compute the annual interest payments in dollars, multiply this nominal yield by the
                                       face amount of the bond ($1,000 unless stated otherwise). A bond with a 5% coupon rate
                                       pays $50 per year. One with an 8% nominal yield pays $80 per year. One with a coupon of
                                       13.5% pays $135 per year. Because, on any particular bond, this interest payment is the same
                                       every year, it is referred to as a fixed charge.

                                              When a question states that a bond pays interest at a rate of 6% semiannually, it
                                              does not mean two payments of $60 per year. The interest rate is always stated on an
                                              annual basis ($60 per year), and it is paid twice per year, or $30 every 6 months.


                                   Current Yield (CY)
                                   Investors always want to know the return on their investment. The most straightforward way
                                   to do that is to place the return on the investment as follows:

                                        _   Return
                                        ​​         ​​
                                        Investment
                                   The return will always be the annual interest in dollars (if referring to a stock, the dividend in
                                   dollars) divided by the current market price (the amount of investment required to own the

                                                                                                                                                Unit 2
                                   security). This calculation is called current yield or current return. For example, if the annual
                                   dividend is $3 and the stock’s price is $60, the calculation is 3 ÷ 5% = $60.

                                   Although most bonds are issued with a face, or par, value of $1,000, bond prices do fluctuate
                                   in the market. As stated earlier, the interest a bond pays is called its coupon rate or nominal
                                   yield. Look at this example: The DBL 10s of ’39. DBL is the name of the issuer, 10s means
                                   the nominal yield is 10%, and ’39 means that the bonds mature in 2039. The letter s is added
                                   because it is easier to say “the 10s” than to say “the 10.” These bonds pay $100 a year ($50
                                   semiannually) for each $1,000 of face value. Regardless of what the market price of the bonds
                                   may be, the DBL Corporation has an obligation to pay annual interest of 10% of the $1,000
                                   face it borrowed.

                                   If an investor were to buy these bonds for more than $1,000 or less than $1,000, the return
                                   on the investment would not be 10%. For example, if these bonds had a current market
                                   value of $800, their current yield would be 12.5% ($100 ÷ $800). Similarly, someone paying
                                   $1,200 for the bonds will receive a current yield of 8.33% ($100 ÷ $1,200). Please note that
                                   the $100 interest received is the same in all cases regardless of the current market price.

                                   Bond prices and yields move in opposite directions: as interest rates rise, bond prices fall, and
                                   vice versa. When a bond trades at a discount, its current yield increases; when it trades at a
                                   premium, its current yield decreases.


                                   Discount and Premium
                                   When a bond is selling at a price above par (or face), it is selling at a premium; when it is
                                   selling below par, it is selling at a discount. Two critical statements to remember are:
                                    If you pay more, you get less.
                                    If you pay less, you get more.
                                   Looking at the examples above, an investor buying a bond at a premium will always receive a
                                   rate of return less than the coupon (or nominal) yield stated on the face of the bond (8.33%
                                   is less than 10%). Conversely, any time an investor purchases a bond at a discount, the return
                                   will be more than the rate stated on the face of the bond (12.5% is greater than 10%).

                                   In addition to being the dollar amount on which the annual interest is based, par value is also
                                   the dollar amount that will be returned to the investor at maturity. Therefore, an investor
                                   purchasing a bond at a discount knows that holding the bond until maturity date will result
                                   in a return of the par value, an amount which will be more than what was paid for the bond.

                                       that the par value received will be less than what was paid for the bond. To accurately reflect
                                       this gain or loss that an investor will have upon maturity, there is another yield to consider—
                                       the yield to maturity, or true yield.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    Another way you may be tested is by giving you a quoted yield and asking you for the
                                                    price relative to par. For example, if a bond with a 5% coupon is currently yielding
                                                    6%, is it selling at a discount, a premium, or par? Well, anytime you are getting a
                                                    yield higher than the coupon rate, the bond has to be selling at a discount from par.
                                                    Conversely, if the bond had a 5% coupon, but the current return was 4%, the bond
                                                    must be selling at a premium to par.
                                                    You may also be asked to determine which is higher (or lower), the current yield or the
                                                    yield to maturity. Because yield to maturity (YTM) accentuates the return by adding
                                                    a profit to a bond bought at a discount or subtracting the loss on a bond bought at a
                                                    premium, the YTM on a discount bond will always be higher than that bond’s current
                                                    yield, and the reverse is true regarding a bond bought at a premium.


                                       Yield to Maturity (YTM) or Basis
                                       This measurement takes into account the gain or loss the investor will have when the bonds
                                       are redeemed at maturity. The person who buys the bonds mentioned above at $800 will get
                                       back $1,000 if the bonds are held to maturity, in addition to receiving $100 per year interest
                                       (a current yield of 12.5% on the $800 investment). Consequently, this investor will have a
                                       gain of $200 on top of the annual interest. The individual paying $1,200 for the bonds will
                                       have a $200 loss at maturity when receiving the face value for them at maturity.

                                       Whenever an investor pays less (buys at a discount), there will be a profit in addition to the
                                       annual interest, and whenever the investor pays more (buys at a premium), there will be a loss
                                       if held to maturity. Try to understand these key facts:
                                        A bond is issued at par ($1,000) because that is how much the issuer is borrowing.
                                        The interest paid on the bond is always fixed as a percentage of the par (face) value.
                                        Regardless of changes in the market value of the bond, the interest checks remain the
                                          same.
                                        The current market price of a bond is determined by supply and demand.
                                        The current market price will fluctuate.
                                        The current market price may be at par, above par, or below par.
                                        A bond always matures at par.
                                        Purchasing a bond at par will always result in getting back the same as the original
                                          investment at maturity.
                                        Purchasing a bond at a discount (below par) will always result in getting back par, which
                                          means more (a profit) than the original investment.
                                        Purchasing a bond at a premium (above par) will always result in getting back par, which
                                          means less (a loss) than the original investment.

                                       Although you will probably not have to do a yield to maturity computation on the exam,
                                       some students find that seeing the numbers played out gives them a better understanding of
                                       the concept. Try to follow this example.

                                             EXAMPLE
                                             An investor who buys a 10% coupon bond at 105 ($1,050 per bond) with 10 years
                                             remaining to maturity can expect $100 in interest per year. If he holds the bond to
                                             maturity, the bondholder loses $50, the amount of the premium. This loss is included
                                             in the YTM approximation.
                                             The actual YTM calculation for this premium bond is shown below:

                                                Annual interest – (premium ÷ years to maturity)

                                                          Average price of the bond

                                                100 − (50 ÷ 10) _  95

                                             A bond’s average price is the price paid plus the amount received at maturity (par)
                                             divided by 2. Alternatively, the average price is that price midway between the
                                             purchase price and par.
                                                                                                                                                   Unit 2
                                             The YTM of a bond bought at a premium is always lower than both the coupon rate
                                             (nominal yield) and the current yield. In this example, the nominal yield is 10%, and
                                             the current yield is 9.52% (100 ÷ 1,050).
                                             If an investor buys a 10-year bond with a 10% coupon for 95 ($950 per bond), he
                                             receives $100 per year in coupon interest payments and a gain of $50 (the amount of
                                             the discount) at maturity. This gain is included in the YTM approximation.
                                             The actual YTM calculation for this discount bond is shown below:

                                                Annual interest + (discount ÷ years to maturity)

                                                          Average price of the bond

                                                100 + (50 ÷ 10) _

                                             (nominal yield) and the current yield. In this example, the nominal yield is 10%, and
                                             the current yield is 10.53% (100 ÷ 950).
                                             If these calculations seem complicated, do not worry. You will have at most one
                                             question requiring a YTM calculation. Focus on the relationship between YTM and
                                             current yield (CY) based on the price of the bond.

                                             TAKE NOTE
                                             YTM is also called the market-driven yield because it reflects the internal rate of
                                             return (IRR) from the bond investment.


                                   Yield to Call (YTC)
                                   A bond with a call feature may be redeemed before maturity at the issuer’s option. Unless the
                                   bond was bought at par, and is callable at par, yield to call (YTC) calculations reflect the early
                                   redemption date and consequent acceleration of the premium loss from the purchase price.

                                   A bond’s yield to call, similar to YTM, is the rate of return the bond provides from the
                                   purchase date to the call date and price. This calculation generates a lower return than does
                                   the YTM and should be considered by investors when evaluating a callable bond trading at a
                                   premium.

                                                    The reason why we’ve only referred to a bond selling at a premium being called for
                                                    redemption is because it is highly unlikely that an issuer would call in a bond that
                                                    was available in the marketplace at a discount. If that were to happen, the yield to
                                                    call would be higher than the yield to maturity because the profit resulting from the
                                                    discount would be accelerated.

                                                    1. What is the current yield of a 6% bond trading for 80 ($800)?
                                                    Current yield = annual income ÷ current market price
                                                    Find the solution as follows: $60 ÷ $800 = 7.5%. This bond is trading at a discount.
                                                    When prices fall, yields rise. The current yield is greater than the nominal yield when
                                                    bonds are trading at a discount.
                                                    2. What is the current yield of a 6% bond trading for 120 ($1,200)?
                                                    Find the solution as follows: $60 ÷ $1,200 = 5%. This bond is trading at a premium. The
                                                    price is up, so the yield is down. The current yield is less than the nominal yield when
                                                    bonds are trading at a premium.
                                                    It is critical to understand the inverse relationship between price and yield. An effective
                                                    way to visualize it is through the chart. When bonds are at par, coupon and current
                                                    yield are equal. When bonds are at a premium, the CY is less than the coupon. When
                                                    bonds are at a discount, the CY is greater than the coupon.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              Know how to calculate the CY of a bond or a stock. Expect to see one question on the
                                              calculation of CY.
                                              The CY of common stock is calculated by dividing the current dividend by the current
                                              price of the stock. For instance, a stock with a $2 dividend trading on the market for
                                              $40 has a 5% CY ($2 ÷ $40 = 5%).

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              Answer the following questions with premium, par, or discount.
                                              A.   If the bond has a YTC lower than its CY, it is trading at ________.
                                              B. If the bond has a YTM and CY that are equal, the bond is trading at ________.
                                              C.   If the bond has a YTM less than its YTC, the bond is trading at ________.
                                              D. If a bond has a YTM greater than its coupon, the bond is trading at ________.
                                              The answers are: 1. premium; 2. par; 3. discount; 4. discount.

                                       Once you understand the yield ranking for discounts, the ranking for premium is easy—it is
                                       the exact opposite.


                                       Price/Yield Relationship
                                       There are many reasons interest rates rise and fall. The main concern for the exam, at this
                                       point, is the effect that interest rates have on the price fluctuations of bonds. As a general rule,
                                       keep in mind that interest rates and bond prices move counter to each other. That is, when
                                       interest rates are going up, the price of older bonds will be going down. When interest rates
                                       are going down, the price of older bonds will be going up.

                                       When most people hear this for the first time, they have difficulty understanding it. Simply
                                       stated, when newly issued bonds are paying a higher rate of interest than ones currently in the
                                       marketplace, those older bonds are not as attractive. After all, if a new bond came out with a
                                       6% coupon, your 4% or 5% bond would not be as valuable (this always assumes equal quality
                                       or rating). Conversely, if you were holding a bond with an 8% coupon, and newly issued
                                       bonds were only offering 6%, your bond is more valuable.

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                         When a bond with a 6% coupon is selling for 90, each of the following statements is
                                                         correct except
                                                          A. the current yield is approximately 6.67%.
                                                          B. the bond is selling at a discount.
                                                          C. the bondholder will receive two semiannual interest payments of $27 each.
                                                          D. the yield to maturity is slightly higher than the current yield.
                                                         Answer: C. A bond with a 6% coupon is going to make two semiannual interest
                                                         payments of $30 each, regardless of the bond’s market price. After all, the loan was
                                                         $1,000 at 6% interest, and that won’t change. A price of 90 is 90% of the $1,000 par—
                                                         clearly a discount. The current yield is the $60 annual interest divided by the $900
                                                         price or 6.67%, and that is a bit lower than the yield to maturity because, if we hold
                                                         the bond to maturity, we’re going to get back the full $1,000, which will represent a
                                                         $100 profit. Please see the chart at the Test Topic Alert above.

             LESSON 2.3: CORPORATE AND TREASURY DEBT SECURITIES
                                                                                                                                                Unit 2
                                   Previously, we stated that the three primary issuers of debt securities are the U.S. government
                                   (and its agencies), municipal issuers (states, cities, counties, etc.), and corporations. This
                                   lesson deals with two of those, with municipal issues being covered in Lesson 2.4.


                                   LO 2.f Recognize the unique features of U.S. government and agency
                                   issues.

                                   Whenever the word government is used in conjunction with a security on the exam, it means
                                   the federal government. U.S. government bonds are the safest of all. There are two primary
                                   types of backing: direct government backing, or guarantee, as in the case of Treasury issues,
                                   and the moral guarantee, as in the case of federal agencies.

                                   Although most government issues trade in what is known as the capital market—that is, the
                                   market for long-term securities, stocks, and bonds—there are several issues that trade in the
                                   money market. The money market is where short-term instruments, those that mature in one
                                   year or less, are traded. The money market will be discussed later in this unit. No discussion of
                                   Treasury issues would be possible, however, without describing the widely held bellwether of
                                   the money market known as U.S. Treasury bills.


                                   Government and Agency Securities
                                   U.S. Treasury Bills
                                   Treasury bills are direct, short-term debt obligations of the U.S. government. They are issued
                                   every week by using a competitive bidding process. Each week, T-bills, as they are known,
                                   with maturities of 4 weeks, 13 weeks, and 26 weeks, are issued, and, once every four weeks,
                                   bills with a 52-week maturity are issued.

                                   Treasury bills pay no interest; they are issued at a discount from their par value. An investor
                                   might purchase a $10,000, 26-week T-bill at a price of $9,800. No interest would be received,
                                   but, at maturity, the Treasury would send the investor a check for $10,000. The difference
                                   between the $9,800 paid and the $10,000 received would be considered interest income even
                                   though a separate interest check was never received.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    Key points to remember regarding T-bills include:
                                                       Treasury bills are always issued and traded at a discount;
                                                       Treasury bills are the only Treasury security issued without a stated interest rate;
                                                       Treasury bills are highly liquid; and
                                                       13-week (also referred to as 91-day) Treasury bills are used in market analysis as
                                                         the stereotypical “risk-free” investment, especially in computations that refer to
                                                         the “risk-free” rate. More about that in Unit 21.


                                       U.S. Treasury Notes
                                       U.S. Treasury notes are direct debt obligations of the U.S. Treasury with the following
                                       characteristics:
                                        They pay semiannual interest as a percentage of the stated par value.
                                        They have intermediate maturities (2, 3, 5, 7, and 10 years).
                                        They mature at par value.
                                        They are noncallable.


                                       U.S. Treasury Bonds
                                       U.S. Treasury bonds are direct debt obligations of the U.S. Treasury with the following
                                       characteristics:
                                        They pay semiannual interest as a percentage of the stated par value.
                                        They have long-term maturities, generally 10–30 years.
                                        They are noncallable.
                                        They mature at par value.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    When doing any calculations relating to bonds on the exam, the par or face value
                                                    will always be $1,000. This is true even though the above three Treasury issues are
                                                    available in denominations as low as $100. Furthermore, all government securities
                                                    are only available in book entry form. That means there are no certificates issued—
                                                    records of the investor’s ownership are electronically “on the books” of the Treasury
                                                    Department.

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                         When Treasury bills are issued, they are quoted at
                                                          A. a premium over par.
                                                          B. 100% of the par value.
                                                          C. par value with interest coupons attached.
                                                          D. a discount from principal with no coupons attached.
                                                         Answer: D. Treasury bills are always issued at a discount; they pay no interest. The
                                                         investor profits by receiving back par value and makes the difference between the
                                                         discounted purchase price and the par received at maturity. All government bonds
                                                         are now book entry (electronic record); there has not been a Treasury note or bond
                                                         issued since July 1986 with interest coupons attached.

                                   Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)
                                   A special type of Treasury issue, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), helps
                                   protect investors against purchasing power risk. These notes are issued with a fixed interest
                                   rate, but the principal amount is adjusted semiannually by an amount equal to the change
                                   in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the standard measurement of inflation. They are issued
                                   with maturities of 5, 10, and 30 years and are also available in denominations of $100 like the
                                   other Treasuries we’ve covered.

                                   The interest payment the investor receives every six months is equal to the fixed interest rate
                                   times the newly adjusted principal. During times of inflation, the interest payments increase,
                                   while during times of deflation, the interest payments fall. These notes are sold at lower
                                   interest rates than conventional fixed-rate Treasury notes because of their adjustable nature.
                                   We will demonstrate the return of a TIPS bond in Unit 22.

                                   Like other Treasury securities, TIPS are exempt from state and local income taxes on the
                                                                                                                                                Unit 2
                                   interest income generated but are subject to federal taxation. However, in any year when the
                                   principal is adjusted upward for inflation, that increase is considered reportable income for
                                   that year even though the increase will not be received until the note matures.

                                             TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                             Interest payments from Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), and increases in

                                                  Answer: A. TIPS offer inflation protection and safety of principal because they are
                                                  backed by the U.S. government.


                                   GNMA Securities
                                   There is one more security guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government.
                                   The Government National Mortgage Association (Ginnie Mae or GNMA) is a wholly owned
                                   government corporation. The primary difference between GNMA securities and the agency
                                   securities that we will cover next is the backing of the federal government.

                                   Ginnie Maes are known as modified pass-through certificates. They represent an interest in
                                   pools of FHA-insured mortgages or Veterans Administration–guaranteed mortgages. The term
                                   pass-through is used because, as the homeowners make their monthly mortgage payments,
                                   those payments are collected in the pool and proportionately pass through to the investor.
                                   This payment received by the investor differs from most other securities in two respects.

                                   First, payments are received monthly, because underlying the security is a pool of home
                                   mortgages, which are paid for monthly. Second, each monthly payment the investor receives
                                   consists partly of interest and partly of principal. Because payments on home mortgages
                                   consist of interest and some principal and, because that money goes into the pool for all the
                                   investors as it is paid out monthly, some of each monthly payment to the investor represents

                                       principal, and the balance of each payment represents interest. The portion of each monthly
                                       payment representing interest is subject to state and local taxation and, of course, federal
                                       income tax as well. Ginnie Maes carry a minimum denomination of $1,000 and then in
                                       $1.00 increments.


                                       U.S. Federal Agency Securities
                                       In addition to those securities issued directly by the U.S. Treasury, the exam covers those
                                       issued by U.S. government agencies. These are known as government-sponsored enterprises
                                       (GSEs). These are quasi-governmental organizations with the power to raise funds by
                                       borrowing (which does not carry the full faith and credit of the federal government) or to
                                       guarantee the debt of others. Although there are a number of agencies authorized to issue
                                       securities, the exam is most likely to limit its coverage to those issuing mortgage-backed
                                       securities. Although the securities do not have direct Treasury backing, they are considered
                                       moral obligations of the U.S. government. As such, they are generally considered second only
                                       to government securities in terms of safety.


                                       Federal National Mortgage Association
                                       The Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) purchases and sells real estate
                                       mortgages—primarily those insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) or
                                       guaranteed by the Veterans Administration (VA). Then, Fannie Mae issues bonds backed by
                                       those mortgages. They are issued at par and pay semiannual interest. That interest is taxable at
                                       all levels: state, local, and federal. Like the other federal issues, they come out in book entry
                                       form. Stock in Fannie Mae is publicly traded.

                                       Whether a Ginnie Mae or a Fannie Mae, the debt obligation is backed by a pool of mortgages,
                                       and the interest and principal pass through to the investors. In reality, only a small percentage
                                       of mortgages last the full term. People move and sell their homes, or they may refinance the
                                       mortgages. Whatever the reason, most mortgages are paid off early. This leads to an unusual
                                       risk for those owning mortgage-backed securities—prepayment risk. Why do people refinance
                                       their mortgage? Usually, it is because interest rates have fallen, and they can get a new
                                       mortgage with a lower interest cost. In that case, the investor receives back the principal ahead
                                       of schedule and now has to reinvest at the current lower rates available. Prepayment risk is a
                                       form of reinvestment risk.


                                       Benefits and Risks of Mortgage-Backed Securities
                                       The primary advantage of investing in mortgage-backed securities is that, compared with
                                       other debt securities with similar ratings, they pay a higher rate of return.

                                       There are a number of risks faced by investors in these securities:
                                        being difficult to understand from being among the most complicated instruments;
                                        prepayment risk due to mortgages being refinanced when rates drop;
                                        default risk, particularly if the mortgages are subprime;
                                        reinvestment risk; and
                                        liquidity risk.

                                   Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA)
                                   One final agency that might be tested is the TVA. The Tennessee Valley Authority is the
                                   nation’s largest public power provider and a corporation of the U.S. government. TVA bonds
                                   are not backed by the U.S. government. Instead, they’re backed by the revenues generated
                                   by the agencies’ projects. However, credit-rating agencies perceive that there is an “implicit
                                   government guarantee of TVA bonds.” If push came to shove, it’s a good bet that Uncle Sam
                                   would make that guarantee explicit.

                                                  Answer: A. A unique feature of Ginnie Maes is that they pay interest on a monthly              Unit 2
                                                  basis, not semiannually. In addition to the interest, investors receive their share of
                                                  that portion of the mortgage payments that represented principal repayment.


                                   LO 2.g Differentiate between secured and unsecured corporate debt.

                                   Corporate debt securities, like any other loan, may be either secured or unsecured. Secured
                                   debt securities are backed by various kinds of assets of the issuing corporation, whereas
                                   unsecured debt securities are backed only by the reputation, credit record, and financial
                                   stability of the corporation. Regardless of whether secured or unsecured, the interest on debt
                                   securities is always paid before dividends on stock (preferred and common).


                                   Secured Debt
                                   Mortgage Bonds
                                   Just as the owner of a home pledges a real asset (the home and land) as collateral for the
                                   mortgage, a corporation will borrow money backed by real estate and physical assets of the
                                   corporation. Just as a home ordinarily would have a market value greater than the principal
                                   amount of its mortgage, the value of the real assets pledged by the corporation will be in
                                   excess of the amount borrowed under that bond issue. If the corporation develops financial
                                   problems and is unable to pay the interest on the bonds, those real assets pledged as collateral
                                   are generally sold to pay off the mortgage bondholders. There may be a situation where
                                   foreclosing on the property results in a sale below the outstanding mortgage balance. In that
                                   case, the mortgage holder becomes a general creditor for the unsatisfied balance.


                                   Equipment Trust Certificates
                                   Corporations, particularly railroads and airline companies, finance the acquisition of their
                                   rolling stock, locomotives, or airplanes by issuing an equipment trust certificate. The company
                                   makes a down payment, usually 20% of the cost of the rolling stock, and finances the balance
                                   over the course of time—for example, 15 years. Because the equipment does wear out, the
                                   railroad will pay off a portion of the loan on an annual basis. At no time, theoretically, is the
                                   value of the assets (the rolling stock, locomotives, or planes) worth less than the amount of
                                   the principal remaining on the loan. When the company has finished paying off the loan,
                                   it receives clear title to its equipment from the trustee. If the company does not make the

                                       payments, the lender repossesses the collateral and sells it for his benefit. If you have ever
                                       financed the purchase of a car, it is basically the same concept.


                                       Collateral Trust Bonds
                                       Sometimes a corporation wants to borrow money and has neither real estate (for a mortgage)
                                       nor equipment (for an equipment trust) to use as collateral. Instead, it deposits securities
                                       it owns into a trust to serve as collateral for the lenders. The securities it deposits can be
                                       securities in that corporation or any other securities as long as the securities are marketable—
                                       that is, readily liquidated. Obviously, the better the quality of the securities deposited as
                                       collateral, the better the quality and rating of the bond. You might see these called collateral
                                       trust certificates.


                                       Unsecured Debt
                                       Debentures
                                       A debenture is a debt obligation of the corporation backed only by its word and general
                                       creditworthiness. Debentures are written promises of the corporation to pay the principal at
                                       its due date and interest on a regular basis. Although this promise is as binding as a promise
                                       for a mortgage bond, debentures are not secured by any pledge of property. They are sold on
                                       the general credit of the company; their security depends on the assets and earnings of the
                                       corporation. Although debentures are unsecured, there are issuers whose credit standing is
                                       so good that their debentures are safer than mortgage bonds of less creditworthy companies.
                                       This is similar in concept to the extension of credit on your credit cards: the better your credit
                                       rating, the higher the limit and the lower the interest rate.


                                       Guaranteed Bonds
                                       A guaranteed bond is a bond that is guaranteed as to payment of interest, or both principal
                                       and interest, by a corporate entity other than the issuer. The value of the guarantee is only
                                       as good as the strength of the company making that guarantee. Guaranteed bonds were
                                       particularly popular in the railroad industry, when a major railroad seeking to lease trackage
                                       rights from a short line would guarantee that smaller company’s debt. A more recent example
                                       is the ExxonMobil Corporation guaranteeing the debt issues of the Exxon Pipeline Company.


                                       Subordinated
                                       The term subordinated means “belonging to a lower or inferior class or rank; secondary.” It is
                                       usually describing a debenture. A subordinated debenture has a claim that is behind (junior
                                       to) that of any other creditor. However, no matter how subordinated the debenture, it is still
                                       senior to any stockholder.

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                         A debenture is issued based on
                                                          A. the general credit of the corporation.
                                                          B. a pledge of real estate.
                                                          C. a pledge of equipment.
                                                          D. the ability to levy taxes.
                                                         Answer: A. There are no pledged assets behind a debenture, merely the credit
                                                         standing of the corporation. It is a corporate IOU.

                                                     When examining the capital structure of a corporation, it is important to know the
                                                     liquidation priority:
                                                      Secured creditors (e.g., mortgage bonds, equipment trust certificates, collateral
                                                        trust bonds)
                                                      Unsecured creditors (e.g., general creditors including debenture holders)
                                                      Subordinated debt holders
                                                      Preferred stockholders
                                                      Common stockholders


                                          Senior Security
                                          Here is an exam-relevant example of the above liquidation priority. The word senior is used to
                                          describe the relative priority of claim of a security. Every preferred stock has a senior claim to

                                                                                                                                                             Unit 2
                                          common stock. Every debt security has a senior claim to preferred stock. Secured bonds have
                                          a senior claim to unsecured debt, such as debentures. The term senior securities means bonds
                                          and preferred stock, because they have a claim senior to common stock. If an exam question
                                          described a corporation as having issued senior bonds, the answer would have to state that
                                          there were mortgage bonds and/or collateral trust bonds and/or equipment trust certificates
                                          issued by that corporation with priority claim ahead of unsecured creditors.

          LESSON 2.4: MUNICIPAL BONDS
                                       LO 2.h Recall the unique features of municipal bonds, including the
                                       calculation of tax-equivalent yield.

                                       Whenever the term municipal security is used on the exam, it is referring to a debt security
                                       issued by a state or political subdivision; for example, a city, county, or school district.
                                       Although there are short-term obligations, the exam will likely only deal with long-term
                                       debt—bonds. Among the key investment features of municipal bonds are the tax treatment
                                       (the interest is generally free from federal income tax—covered shortly) and the safety. The
                                       record of safety of principal and interest payments of municipal bonds is second only to that
                                       of government issues. There is another unique feature of these securities. You can purchase
                                       municipal bonds where the scheduled payment of interest and repayment of the principal
                                       at maturity are insured—the issuer has taken out an insurance policy from one of several
                                       consortiums that offers this kind of protection. There are two basic types of municipal bonds.


                                       Types of Municipal Bonds
                                       General Obligation Bonds (GOs)
                                       General obligation bonds are backed by a pledge of the issuer’s full faith and credit for prompt
                                       payment of principal and interest. Most city, county, and school district bonds have the
                                       further distinction of being secured by a pledge of unlimited ad valorem (property) taxes to be
                                       levied against all taxable property. Because GOs are geared to tax resources, they are normally
                                       analyzed in terms of the size of the resources being taxed. They are generally very safe.


                                       Revenue Bonds
                                       Revenue bonds are payable from the earnings of a revenue-producing enterprise, such as
                                       a water, sewer, electric, or gas system, toll bridge, airport, college dormitory, or any other
                                       income-producing facility.

                                       Authorities and agencies are created by states or their subdivisions to perform specific
                                       functions, such as the operation of water, sewer, or electric systems, bridges, tunnels, or
                                       highways, and, in some states, to construct schools or public facilities. In some cases, the
                                       authority has the right to levy fees and charges for its services. In other cases, it receives lease
                                       rentals, which may be payable from specific revenues or may be general obligations of the
                                       lessee. The yield, generally, is higher for this type of bond than for a GO (taxes are more
                                       secure than revenues).

                                   Tax Equivalent Yield (TEY)
                                   One final factor to be considered in the analysis of debt securities is taxability. When it
                                   comes to taxation, the interest on corporate bonds is taxed as ordinary income on both state
                                   and federal tax returns, while the interest on Treasury debt is only taxable at the federal
                                   level. Municipal bonds have one important characteristic that sets them apart from all other
                                   securities. In most cases, interest received from municipal bonds is free of federal income tax,
                                   and if the investor resides in the issuer’s state, it is generally free of state income tax as well.

                                   Assume an investor has $2,000 to invest. If he purchases, at par, one corporate or government
                                   bond of standard size ($1,000) with a 10% nominal (coupon) yield, he would receive $100
                                   per year paid by two semiannual interest checks of $50. For purposes of this example, assume
                                   that he is in the 28% federal income tax bracket. An individual in the 28% tax bracket pays
                                   tax on any additional income earned at a rate of 28%. Therefore, on the $100 in interest he
                                   received above, he would pay the IRS $28 (28%) and keep the other $72.

                                                                                                                                                 Unit 2
                                   The other $1,000 the investor had available to invest was used to purchase a $1,000 par-value
                                   municipal bond with a 7.5% nominal yield. He would receive $75 annually on that bond
                                   paid, by two semiannual interest checks of $37.50. The 10% bonds, on which the interest
                                   is taxable, would net $72 per year after taxes. Of the $75 interest received for the 7.5%
                                   municipal, none of it is taxed; the whole amount is kept. Therefore, a client in the 28%
                                   bracket should purchase 7.5% municipals before 10% corporates. The taxable equivalent yield
                                   of a 7.5% tax-free bond for this investor in the 28% tax bracket would be the tax-free yield
                                   divided by its complement (100% minus the tax bracket)—in this case, 7.5 ÷ (100 – 28), or
                                   .72. That equals 10.42%, so it is obvious that the 7.5% municipal bond will provide a higher
                                   after-tax return.

                                   There are two ways to work with tax equivalent yield (TEY). The first we’ve just done; that is,
                                   given the coupon on a municipal bond and the investor’s tax bracket, divide that coupon by
                                   (100 – tax bracket) to determine what a taxable security would have to pay to give the same
                                   after-tax return.

                                   Alternatively, we might know the taxable security’s coupon and the investor’s tax bracket,
                                   and we want to know what the tax-free bond must yield to give us an equivalent yield. For
                                   example, a taxable bond is paying 8% interest and the investor is in the 30% tax bracket.
                                   Therefore, the investor will pay taxes equal to 2.4% (30% of the 8%). After paying taxes, the
                                   investor will keep the other 5.6% (8% – 2.4%). So, a tax-free bond paying 5.6% will offer a
                                   tax equivalent yield equal to the 8% one.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              The tax equivalent yield for a municipal bond issued by an entity within a state with a
                                              state income tax will have a higher tax equivalent yield to a resident of that state due
                                              to the “double” tax exemption.
                                              The formula for computing tax equivalent yield (TEY) is:
                                              Municipal bond coupon divided by (100% – investor’s tax bracket).
                                              Therefore, if the coupon rate (nominal yield) of the municipal bond is 4.2% and the
                                              investor is in the 40% tax bracket, you would divide 4.2% by (100% – 40%) or 4.2% by
                                              60% and arrive at a TEY of 7%. That is, in order to receive the same after-tax benefit,
                                              this investor would have to purchase a taxable bond (corporate or government) with a
                                              coupon of 7%. This can be easily proven by taking the 7% yield and reducing it by the
                                              40% tax, which results in 7% minus 2.8% tax, or 4.2%.

          LESSON 2.5: FOREIGN DEBT SECURITIES

                                       LO 2.i Identify the advantages and disadvantages of investing in
                                       foreign debt securities.

                                       Many investors choose to diversify their portfolios by investing in bonds issued by sovereign
                                       foreign governments. Some, such as the gilts (a gilt is a UK liability issued by the British
                                       Treasury and listed on the London Stock Exchange), are extremely safe. Others, especially
                                       those issued by countries with a less-established financial structure, can be very risky and
                                       may even carry a rating equivalent to a junk bond. In addition, it is also possible to invest
                                       in corporate debt securities issued by foreign business entities. Once again, there is a great
                                       variation in risk. The advantages of investing in foreign bonds include:
                                        Potentially higher returns
                                        Diversification
                                        Hedging against a drop in value of the U.S. dollar
                                       Risks would include those found with all debt securities plus:
                                        Currency risk (if the foreign currency falls in value against the dollar)
                                        Potentially higher risk of default
                                        Generally less liquidity
                                        Generally higher trading costs

                                   In Unit 3, we will discuss how most investors use pooled investment vehicles, such as mutual
                                   funds, to invest in foreign debt securities.


                                   Eurobonds and Eurodollar Bonds
                                   A Eurobond is any long-term debt instrument issued and sold outside the country of the
                                   currency in which it is denominated. A U.S. dollar–denominated Eurobond, or Eurodollar
                                   bond, is a bond issued and sold outside the United States but for which the principal and
                                   interest are stated and paid in U.S. dollars. Foreign corporations, foreign governments,
                                   domestic corporations, and domestic governments (including municipalities) can issue
                                   Eurodollar bonds. The U.S. government does not issue Eurodollar bonds.

                                             Test questions sometimes ask you to contrast Eurobonds and Eurodollar bonds. The
                                             name of the instrument tells you how principal and interest are paid. Eurodollar bonds             Unit 2
                                             pay in U.S. dollars; Eurobonds pay in foreign currency. Note that these instruments
                                             must be issued outside of the United States.

                                             TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                             What is a Yankee bond? There are a number of cute names given to bonds in an
                                             attempt to signify where they are issued, in what currency they are denominated, and
                                             by whom they are issued. The Yankee bond is a first cousin to the Eurodollar bond
                                             discussed above.
                                             Just as a Eurodollar bond is a U.S. dollar–denominated bond issued outside the
                                             United States, a Yankee bond is a U.S. dollar–denominated bond issued by a
                                             non-U.S. entity in the U.S. market. Another example of this is the Maple bond, a
                                             Canadian dollar–denominated bond issued by a non-Canadian entity in the Canadian
                                             market. Can you guess what a Matilda bond is? (Clue—it takes its name from a song
                                             that had “waltzing” in the title.) The answer will be found later in this course.

                                   The primary reason for issuing these bonds is that they are free from the requirement to
                                   register with the SEC, resulting in lower issuance costs. However, because the liquidity is not
                                   as great as with domestic issues, and because the political and country risks tend to be higher,
                                   yields are generally higher.

                                             TAKE NOTE
                                             If you purchase a bond issued in a foreign currency, you will receive your fixed rate of
                                             interest in that currency. However, when converting to U.S. dollars, you will be subject
                                             to currency risk. The same is true at maturity. For example, if you purchase £100,000
                                             of UK gilts (the term given to their government bonds) with a 4% coupon, you would
                                             always receive £4,000 per year in interest. At the exchange rate in effect when this
                                             is being written (£1 = $1.41), the bonds would cost you $141,000 and you would be
                                             receiving the equivalent of $5,640 in interest. At maturity you would receive £100,000,
                                             but if the value of the pound had fallen, say to $1.25, then the value of the matured
                                             bonds would be only $125,000. The same would be true about your interest payments
                                             if, during the holding period, the pound changed in value. Remember, currency values
                                             can fluctuate up or down; that is the nature of currency risk.

                                                    Disadvantages of Eurodollar bonds (as with foreign bonds in general) are:
                                                     Because they are not registered with the SEC, there may be a lack of transparency.
                                                     They have political and country risks (taken into consideration by the rating
                                                       agencies).

                                                     They have currency risk (if denominated in a currency other than one’s home country).

                                       1989 to exchange defaulted commercial bank loans issued in less-developed countries, particularly
                                       in Latin America, with a security that could be carried on the bank’s books as a performing asset.
                                       The first Brady agreement was reached with Mexico, and the bonds were first issued in March
                                       1990. Partners in the program were the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank.
                                       Most Brady bonds are denominated in U.S. dollars. Maturities range from 10 to 30 years and may
                                       be interest bearing or discounted or even zero coupon. The safety of a Brady bond largely depends
                                       on the pledged collateral frequently a U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bond. The Brady bond market
                                       was the largest and most actively traded emerging market asset class, but, as most of the countries
                                       involved have matured, Brady bonds are only a small fraction today. Because of their relatively high
                                       safety, Brady bonds are generally more liquid than other debt issues from emerging markets.

                                       The Brady Plan offered several important benefits:
                                        Those countries who participated were able to reduce their overall debt levels as well as
                                          the debt servicing cost.
                                        For the bank’s portfolio, their sovereign risk was diversified.
                                        The plan encouraged emerging market countries to undertake economic reforms.
                                        With the added safety and promise of economic reforms, emerging market countries had
                                          a broader access to the financial markets.

                                                    No Brady bond carries a U.S. government guarantee.

                                                         Which of the following statements is not true?
                                                          A. A country wishing to restructure its debt using Brady bonds would do so to
                                                              save on debt servicing costs.
                                                          B. One of the benefits of holding convertible debentures is the option to convert
                                                              into the corporation’s common stock.
                                                          C. U.S. Treasury securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the United
                                                              States of America.
                                                          D. A resident of France purchasing Eurodollar bonds does not incur currency risk.

                                                                   Unit 2   Types and Characteristics of Fixed-Income (Debt) Securities   45


                                                  Answer: D. As the name implies, Eurodollar bonds are denominated in U.S. dollars.
                                                  That means that someone in France will have the risk that the euro, the home
                                                  currency in France, will rise against the dollar and, as a result, interest payments
                                                  will be worth less, as will the ultimate payback at maturity. Only U.S. residents
                                                  have no currency risk with Eurodollar bonds. One of the benefits of Brady bonds
                                                  is the ability of the sovereign government to borrow at a lower cost because of the
                                                  collateral behind the bond. At least for exam purposes, there are no securities with a
                                                  stronger guarantee of timely payment of interest and principal than those issued by
                                                  the U.S. Treasury. Convertible debentures are convertible into the issuer’s common
                                                  stock, which is a benefit if the stock rises in price.

                                             1.   Advantages of Brady bonds to an American investor include all of the following except
                                                   A. tax-free interest.
                                                   B. greater liquidity than found in most emerging market securities.

                                                                                                                                                Unit 2
                                                   C. greater safety than most emerging market debt because of the collateral.
                                                   D. higher yields than on U.S. Treasury securities.
                                             2.   All of the following are advantages of Eurodollar bonds except
                                                   A. because they are U.S. dollar denominated, they bear no currency risk to
                                                         U.S. investors.
                                                   B. greater transparency.
                                                   C. they are rated by U.S. rating agencies, so the risk is clear.
                                                   D. they may offer higher yields than domestic bonds from the same issuer.


             LESSON 2.6: PAYING OFF THE DEBT

                                   LO 2.j Recall the methods of repayment of principal.

                                   As stated in the beginning of this unit, in addition to receiving regular income from the
                                   investment, the investor expects to receive a return of the loan principal. Normally, one
                                   expects to be paid off when the debt matures. However, there are cases when the issuer pays
                                   off the debt prior to maturity.


                                   Zero-Coupon Bonds
                                   The nominal (coupon) rate on a zero-coupon bond is zero. Zero-coupon bonds are issued at a
                                   substantial discount from par. They pay no interest, but the difference between the discounted
                                   price paid and the par value received at maturity makes up for the lack of a current interest
                                   coupon. For example, if an investor were to purchase a new zero-coupon bond for $500 that
                                   matured at par in 10 years, he would receive a profit of $500 in 10 years, or an average of $50
                                   per year on an out-of-pocket expenditure of $500. Here are the key things to remember about
                                   zero-coupon bonds:
                                    They are always issued at a discount.
                                    There is no reinvestment risk because there are no interest payments to worry about
                                      reinvesting.
                                    They are more volatile than other bonds of similar quality.
                                    Even though no periodic interest payments are received, the IRS requires the issuer to
                                      send a Form 1099-OID indicating the taxable interest to be reported each year. This is
                                      generally referred to as phantom income because you don’t “see” it, but you pay tax on it.

                                        This investment is particularly useful when there is a target goal, such as a college
                                          education or a qualified retirement plan. This is particularly true because of the tax
                                          treatment mentioned above. Unless it is a large quantity, the child generally incurs little, if
                                          any, tax liability, and the earnings in the retirement plan are tax deferred.

                                       In the case of zero-coupon corporate or municipal securities, there is a somewhat higher level
                                       of credit risk. (On a 20-year bond, the investor receives nothing until the maturity date, and
                                       if the issuer is insolvent at that time, the investor has received nothing during the entire 20
                                       years.) However, no credit risk exists in the case of zero-coupon treasuries (known as STRIPS
                                       for Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities) because the risk of
                                       default on a U.S. government security (at least for purposes of this exam) is nonexistent.

                                       The major attraction of this type of investment is that it allows an investor to lock in a yield (or rate
                                       of return) for a predetermined, investor-selected time with no reinvestment risk. Because all zeroes
                                       are sold at a discount and have no current return, there is a great deal of price volatility. This point
                                       will be reviewed again later in Unit 20 in the discussion on duration.


                                       Callable Bonds
                                       Most of the questions on the exam dealing with early payback of principal are about callable
                                       bonds. Bonds can be either callable or noncallable. The call feature permits the issuer to
                                       redeem its bonds (pay off the principal) before maturity if it so desires. The call feature is most
                                       often exercised when interest rates (borrowing costs) have declined. In this case, the issuer
                                       could take advantage of the lower cost of borrowing by issuing new bonds at the lower rate
                                       prevailing in the market and using those proceeds to call in the old bonds with their higher
                                       coupons. This is similar to refinancing a home mortgage, but in this business we use the term
                                       refunding. In most cases, especially when the call takes place many years before the maturity
                                       date, the call price is at a premium to par. An issuer would not be interested in redeeming its
                                       bonds when interest rates have gone up and the bond prices have gone down; the cheapest
                                       way for the issuer to retire its debt is to buy it in the open market.

                                       Much of what we covered in LO 1.c dealing with callable preferred stock applies here. Unless the
                                       call date is far in the future, the call price is usually at a premium to par. If the bond is called, the
                                       issuer announces the final date to tender (turn in) the bond. After that date, the bond no longer
                                       earns interest and any special rights, such as the ability to convert (next topic), are gone.


                                       Call Protection
                                       Before purchasing a bond, determine the extent of its call protection. Call protection is the
                                       number of years into the issue before the issuer may exercise the call provision. The best call
                                       protection a bond may have is if a bond is noncallable; in other words, the issuer cannot call it
                                       early, and the investor has the best protection against a call.

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                         A bond issue that may be retired in advance of maturity at the option of the issuer is
                                                         said to have
                                                          A. a callable feature.

                                                          C. a conversion feature.
                                                          D. a cumulative feature.

                                                  Answer: A. A bond that is callable has a provision that the issuer, at its option, may
                                                  redeem that bond at a specified price known as the call or redemption price. As
                                                  we will see below, the conversion feature may be exercised by the investor, not the
                                                  issuer.


                                   Convertible Debt
                                   As covered in LO 2.d, the exam also deals with debt securities paid off before maturity when
                                   investors exercise the convertible feature. Although the term convertible bonds is often used,
                                   in reality most are debentures rather than secured debt. For exam purposes, the distinction
                                   is not important. In addition to being able to understand and compute the parity price of a
                                   convertible security, the exam deals with suitability of this type of investment for advisory
                                   clients. It is important to view this as a sort of hybrid security. On the one hand, there is
                                   the fixed-income security—the convertible. At the same time, there is the connection to the
                                   issuer’s common stock. That is, once that stock’s market price increases above the conversion
                                   price, the investor has the opportunity to sell the debt security for a premium over the par                  Unit 2
                                   value. It is this duality that causes some who practice asset allocation (covered in Unit 21) to
                                   consider this an equity investment rather than fixed income.


                                   Advantages to Investors
                                   Downside protection. The investor is a creditor. If the company’s business does not prosper
                                   and the stock does not go up, or declines in value, the investor becomes, as a debenture
                                   holder, a creditor. Interest must be paid semiannually, and the principal must be repaid
                                   at maturity. The investor has assured income as long as the company is solvent, and has a
                                   bondholder’s claim in the event of financial difficulty. Convertibles carry a lower interest rate
                                   than nonconvertibles because of the added bonus of the convertibility factor. If the underlying
                                   common stock declines to a point where the convertibility factor is worth nothing, then the
                                   debenture will sell on the basis of its yield alone, like any other debt security. That is why the
                                   market price of convertibles tends to be less volatile than the underlying common stock.

                                   Upside potential. If the company’s business prospers, the underlying stock will increase in
                                   market value. Because the bondholder can convert to stock, the market price of the bond
                                   will go up parallel to the increase in the common stock price. That can have the effect of
                                   mitigating the interest rate risk found in virtually all fixed-income investments.

                                   A convertible bondholder, therefore, has all the upside potential of the common stockholder
                                   with less downside risk.


                                   Disadvantages to Investors
                                   Among the disadvantages to investors in convertible bonds are that they receive a lower
                                   interest rate than a nonconvertible debt and, of course, the possibility that the convertible
                                   bond may be called away before one is ready to convert.


                                   Antidilutive Protection
                                   One of the concerns of any holder of a convertible security (bond or preferred stock) is
                                   protection against the potential dilution resulting from a stock split or a stock dividend. For
                                   example, if you owned a bond convertible into 20 shares and the issuer declared a 2-for-1
                                   stock split, in order for you to have the same conversion powers, you would need to be able

                                       to convert into 40 shares. If the conversion privilege were expressed as a conversion price,
                                       the new price would now be half the former one, allowing you to convert into twice as many
                                       “new” shares.

          LESSON 2.7: MONEY MARKETS AND BANK ACCOUNTS

                                       LO 2.k Identify the special characteristics of money market
                                       instruments and the risks and benefits of adding them to a client’s
                                       portfolio.

                                       As we will learn when discussing asset allocation programs later in this course, one important
                                       asset is cash. Now, we don’t mean greenbacks buried in the mattress or the backyard; we’re
                                       referring to places to keep funds that are in the bank or in securities that are considered to be
                                       the same as cash. When it comes to cash equivalents, the exam will include money market
                                       instruments with a maturity of up to one year.


                                       Money Markets
                                       The money market may be defined as the market for buying and selling short-term loanable
                                       funds in the form of securities and loans. It is called the money market because that is what is
                                       traded there: money, not cash. The buyer of a money market instrument is the lender of the
                                       money; the seller of a money market instrument is the entity borrowing the money.

                                       Although there are many different kinds of money market instruments, there are several
                                       common factors. For example, they all have a maturity date of one year or less. In fact, the
                                       majority of money market instruments mature in less than six months. Another factor that
                                       many (but not all) money market instruments share is that they are issued at a discount; they
                                       do not pay interest because debt securities generally pay interest semiannually and, because
                                       most money market instruments have a maturity of six months or less, the administrative
                                       costs of paying out interest would be very high. Therefore, the solution is to issue the security
                                       at a discount with the investor being paid back par at maturity. The difference between the
                                       two is that the investor’s income paid for the use of her money. Money market instruments are
                                       safe. Although some are not quite as safe as others (e.g., commercial paper is not as safe as a
                                       Treasury bill), they are all considered to be low-risk securities.

                                   Treasury Securities
                                   Because there is so much Treasury debt outstanding, the level of activity in Treasury bills
                                   and other short-term government issues is by far the highest and most carefully watched.
                                   Governments with short terms also refer to U.S. Treasury notes or U.S. Treasury bonds that
                                   are in their last year before maturity because, at that time, they would trade like any other
                                   security with one year or less to maturity.


                                   Negotiable Certificates of Deposit (CDs)
                                   These CDs are unsecured time deposits (no asset of the bank is pledged as collateral), and the
                                   money is being loaned to the bank for a specified period of time. A negotiable CD allows the
                                   initial investor, or any subsequent owner of the CD, to sell the CD in the open market prior
                                   to maturity date. The bank that issues the CD redeems the CD at face value plus interest
                                   on maturity date. CDs are the only money market instrument that pays periodic interest,

                                                                                                                                               Unit 2
                                   usually semiannually. To be considered a negotiable CD, such CDs must have a face value of
                                   $100,000 or more, with $1 million or more being most common. Although maturities can
                                   run as long as 10 years, it is those with a maturity of 1 year or less that are considered money
                                   market instruments.

                                             TAKE NOTE
                                             In the industry (and sometimes on the exam), negotiable CDs are referred to as jumbo
                                             CDs. Although covered by FDIC insurance, these are not the CDs that you purchase at
                                             your local bank branch. We’ll discuss them shortly.

                                             TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              Negotiable CDs do not have a prepayment penalty.
                                              FDIC insurance applies up to $250,000.

                                   Commercial Paper
                                   Another money market instrument is commercial paper. This is short-term unsecured paper
                                   issued by corporations (especially finance companies) primarily to raise working capital—in
                                   other words, for current rather than long-term needs. As you saw when we covered securities
                                   exemptions in Part 1, commercial paper is exempt from registration on both the federal and
                                   state levels as long as the maximum maturity is 270 days.

                                   While negotiable CDs are interest bearing and issued at face amount, commercial paper is
                                   generally issued at a discount—instead of receiving interest, the investor receives the face
                                   amount at maturity.


                                   Eurodollars and Foreign Currency Markets
                                   As described in the previous LO, the cost of raising money and doing business is not restricted
                                   by national boundaries. International monetary factors, such as changes in foreign currency
                                   exchange rates, Eurodollars, or other Eurosecurities, can also affect U.S. money markets and
                                   businesses.

                                                    EXAMPLE
                                                    Euroyen are Japanese yen deposited in banks outside Japan. In other words, when
                                                    a currency is preceded by the prefix Euro, it refers to a bank deposit outside of the
                                                    currency’s home country.
                                                    Eurodollar time deposits tend to be short term, ranging from overnight to 180
                                                    days. European banks lend Eurodollars to other banks in much the same way that
                                                    U.S. banks lend federal funds. The interest rate is usually based on the London
                                                    Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR).


                                       London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR)
                                       LIBOR, sometimes referred to as the ICE-LIBOR, is derived from a survey of banks
                                       conducted each day in London, UK, on behalf of the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).
                                       Lenders are asked how much it would cost them to borrow from each other for 15 different
                                       periods, from overnight to one year, in currencies including dollars, euros, yen, and Swiss
                                       francs. Rates are based on actual transactions for which records are kept. After a set number of
                                       quotes are excluded, those remaining are averaged and published for each currency by the ICE

                                                    The exam may expect you to know that the LIBOR rate is the world’s most widely used
                                                    benchmark for short-term interest rates.


                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    Scandals in London have raised doubts about the future use of the LIBOR. Alternative
                                                    measurements have been proposed, and it is likely by late 2022 or so that there will be
                                                    a new tool. It appears that the final date for the LIBOR will be June 30, 2023. When that
                                                    happens and the LIBOR is no longer the answer to the questions, our QBank will be
                                                    updated and the new information will be posted to the Content Updates.
                                                    At this time, one of the leading replacement candidates is the SOFR. The Secured
                                                    Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash
                                                    overnight collateralized by Treasury securities. If you should see this on your exam,

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  A company realizes money from the sale of surplus equipment. It would like to invest
                                                  this money but will need it in 4–6 months and must take that into consideration
                                                  when selecting an investment. You would recommend
                                                    A. preferred stock.
                                                   B. Treasury bills.
                                                   C. AAA rated bonds with long-term maturities.
                                                   D. common stock.
                                                  Answer: B. For this client, the appropriate investment is a money market instrument,
                                                  and nothing is safer than a T-bill.

                                   In summation, why would you place money market securities in a client’s portfolio?
                                    Highly liquid
                                    Very safe
                                    The best place to store money that will be needed soon                                                     Unit 2
                                   In doing so, the client would be incurring the following risks:
                                    Because of their many advantages, the rate of return is quite low, so these are not suitable
                                      for long-term investors.
                                    Fluctuating income—due to short-term maturities, principal is potentially being
                                      reinvested at a different rate each time the instrument matures.


                                   Bank Accounts
                                   As mentioned, when referring to cash as part of one’s asset allocation, in addition to cash
                                   equivalents in the form of money market instruments, one might keep the proverbial “cash in
                                   the bank.” The term insured will frequently be used on the exam because, at least up to the
                                   legal limits, the funds involved are insured by the FDIC. There are several ways this may be
                                   done.


                                   Demand Deposit
                                   This is the legal term for a checking account. It is the favorite repository for funds that will be
                                   needed in the very near term.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              What we normally refer to as cash in the bank is, in banking terms, known as a
                                              demand deposit. To bankers, the term demand deposit refers to a type of account
                                              (usually just shown by the initials DDA) held at banks and financial institutions that
                                              may be withdrawn at any time by the customer. Historically, the term referred only
                                              to checking accounts, but it now commonly includes savings accounts and money
                                              market accounts (not money market mutual funds—those are not banking products).
                                              When analyzing a client’s financial profile, it should be understood that these are
                                              considered short-term funds (readily available) and provide safe but low returns.


                                   Certificates of Deposit (CDs) (Time Deposit)
                                   In the money market segment a few pages ago, we introduced you to the jumbo (negotiable)
                                   CD. Here, we’re referring to the nonnegotiable (you can’t sell it to anyone, you can only

                                       redeem it at the bank) certificate of deposit available at your local branch (or online). These
                                       are typically available with a minimum deposit of as little as $500 and maturities of anywhere
                                       from three months to five years. In most cases, withdrawal prior to the maturity date will
                                       result in a penalty. Here are some key facts to remember for the exam:
                                        If capital preservation is the goal with no risk, the answer is an insured bank CD.
                                        Insured bank CDs have no interest rate risk (they don’t fluctuate in value as interest rates
                                          change).
                                        Even with the potential early withdrawal penalty, these are considered liquid assets, but
                                          certainly not as liquid as a DDA.

                                       There are risks, however:
                                        As fixed-income investments, they bear purchasing power (inflation) risk.
                                        Yields tend to be quite low, so they should not be a major portion of a long-term
                                          investment.

             INTRODUCTION
                                   In addition to equity and debt, other investments related to stocks and bonds are available
                                   to investors. Such investment products include packaged products such as mutual funds,
                                   exchange-traded funds (ETFs), variable contracts of insurance companies (variable annuities and
                                   variable life insurance), and real estate investment trusts (REITs). These packaged products are
                                   generally referred to as pooled investments because they represent a pool of funds contributed
                                   by a number of investors.

          LESSON 3.1: INVESTMENT COMPANIES
                                      LO 3.a Identify the legal requirements of investment companies.

                                      The first of the pooled investment vehicles we’ll cover are investment companies. An
                                      investment company is a corporation or a trust through which investors may acquire an
                                      interest in large, diversified portfolios of securities by pooling their funds with other investors’
                                      funds. People often invest in investment companies because they believe a professional money
                                      manager should be able to outperform the average investor in the market.

                                      As with all investments, there are benefits and risks. This unit will close with a discussion
                                      of the benefits and risks for most of the pooled investments covered. Investment companies
                                      raise capital by selling shares to the public. Investment companies must abide by similar
                                      registration and prospectus requirements imposed by the Securities Act of 1933 on most other
                                      issuers.

                                      Investment companies are also subject to regulations regarding how their shares are sold
                                      to the public. The Investment Company Act of 1940 provides for Securities and Exchange
                                      Commission (SEC) regulation of investment companies and their activities.


                                      Types of Investment Companies
                                      The Investment Company Act of 1940 classifies investment companies into three broad types:
                                      face-amount certificate companies (FACC), management investment companies, and unit
                                      investment trusts (UITs), which will be covered a bit later in LO 3.f.


                                      Face-Amount Certificate Companies (FACC)
                                      A face-amount certificate (FAC) is a contract between an investor and an issuer in which
                                      the issuer guarantees payment of a stated (or fixed) sum to the investor at some set date in the
                                      future. In return for this future payment, the investor agrees to pay the issuer a set amount of
                                      money either as a lump sum or in periodic installments.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   The only fact you need to know about this security is that it is one of the three types of
                                                   investment companies listed in the Investment Company Act of 1940.


                                      Management Investment Companies
                                      The most familiar type of investment company is the management investment company,
                                      which actively manages a securities portfolio to achieve a stated investment objective. A
                                      management investment company is either closed-end or open end. Mutual funds are
                                      open-end investment companies. Initially, both closed-end and open-end companies sell
                                      shares to the public; the difference between them lies in the way they raise capital and how
                                      investors buy and sell their shares—in the primary or secondary market.

                                             TAKE NOTE
                                             Open-end and closed-end investment companies have far more similarities than
                                             differences. One of these is the term net asset value per share, generally shown as NAV.
                                             This value is the result of the fund valuing all of its assets (the largest of which is the
                                             portfolio), subtracting its liabilities and then dividing that by the number of shares
                                             outstanding. This NAV per share computation is critical to the purchase and sale of
                                             open-end companies, and, as we’ll soon see, has little relationship to the buying and
                                             selling price of closed-end funds.


                                             TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                             It is important for you to know that the definition of investment company does not
                                             include holding companies.


                                   Board of Directors
                                   In general, management investment companies (open-end and closed-end) cannot have a
                                   board of directors that consists of more than 60% of persons who meet the definition of
                                   interested persons of the investment company.

                                             TAKE NOTE
                                             Another way of stating that no more than 60% of the directors may be interested
                                             persons is to say that at least 40% must be noninterested—that is, “outside” directors.
                                             These are individuals who have no connection to the fund other than a position on
                                             the board (and maybe owning some shares of the fund as would any other investor).
                                             Typically, outside directors are academics or prominent community members.                         Unit 3

                                   Prohibited Activities
                                   Open-end investment companies are prohibited from engaging in several activities. Mutual
                                   funds may not:
                                    purchase any security on margin;
                                    participate on a joint basis in any trading account in securities (i.e., an investment
                                      company cannot have a joint account with someone else);
                                    sell any security short; or
                                    acquire more than 3% of the outstanding voting securities of another investment
                                      company.

                                             PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  The Investment Company Act of 1940 prohibits registered open-end investment
                                                  companies from engaging in any of the following practices except
                                                   A. issuing common stock.
                                                   B. selling short or purchasing securities for the company’s portfolio on margin.
                                                   C. owning more than 3% of the outstanding voting securities of another
                                                        investment company.
                                                   D. opening a joint account with another investment company.
                                                  Answer: A. The one thing that all open-end investment companies must do is
                                                  issue common stock. That is the form of ownership. All of the other activities are
                                                  prohibited.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   Do not confuse the Investment Company Act prohibition against an investment
                                                   company using margin for portfolio transactions with the Securities and Exchange Act
                                                   of 1934 Section 11(d)(1). That section (number not tested) states that it is unlawful for
                                                   a broker-dealer to effect any transaction in connection where, directly or indirectly, he
                                                   extends or maintains or arranges for the extension or maintenance of credit to or for
                                                   a customer on any security that was a part of a new issue in the distribution of which
                                                   he participated. Because mutual funds are a continuous new issue, they cannot be
                                                   purchased on margin. However, there is a special exemption for certain investment
                                                   company securities held by broker-dealers as collateral in margin accounts. Any
                                                   securities issued by a registered open-end investment company or unit investment
                                                   trust shall be exempt from the provisions of Section 11(d)(1) when the broker-dealer
                                                   extends credit on that security, provided the security has been owned by the person to
                                                   whom credit would be provided for more than 30 days (more on this in Unit 23).


                                      Changes in Investment Policy
                                      In order for an investment company’s board to make fundamental investment policy changes,
                                      a majority vote of the outstanding voting stock is required. Examples of fundamental changes
                                      would include:
                                       a change in subclassification, such as from an open-end to a closed-end company or from
                                         a diversified to a nondiversified company;
                                       deviation from any fundamental policy in its registration statement, including a change in
                                         investment objective; and
                                       changing the nature of its business so as to cease to be an investment company.
                                      In other words, because the investment company is supposed to function for the benefit of the
                                      shareholders, any of these changes would require the vote of a majority of the shareholders.


                                      Size of Investment Companies
                                      No registered investment company is permitted to make a public offering of securities unless
                                      it has a net worth of at least $100,000.


                                      Investment Advisory and Underwriter Contracts
                                      A majority vote of the shareholders is required to approve the contract between the investment
                                      company and its investment adviser and the contract with its principal underwriter. These
                                      contracts must be in writing and provide that the contract:
                                       precisely describes all compensation to be paid;
                                       will be approved at least annually by the board of directors or by majority vote of the
                                         shareholders if it is to be renewed after the first two years; and
                                       may be terminated at any time, without penalty, by the board of directors or by majority
                                         vote of the shareholders on not more than 60 days’ written notice to the investment adviser.

                                      In addition, it is unlawful for any registered investment company to enter into or renew any
                                      contract with an investment adviser or principal underwriter unless the terms have been
                                      approved by majority vote of directors who are not parties to such contract as affiliated
                                      persons (i.e., directors who are not affiliated with the adviser or the underwriter, and who in
                                      the aggregate must comprise at least 40% of the directors).

                                             TAKE NOTE
                                             The effect of this final paragraph is that no advisory contract, whether initial or
                                             renewal, may take effect without approval of the noninterested members of the board.


                                   Transactions of Certain Affiliated Persons and Underwriters
                                   Those individuals who are affiliated with the investment company or its underwriter have
                                   certain restrictions when it comes to dealing with the fund. These individuals cannot
                                    sell any personally owned security to the fund except redeeming personally owned shares
                                      of the fund (like any other investor);
                                    borrow money from the fund; or
                                    purchase from that investment company any security other than the fund’s shares.

                                             TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                             An affiliated person is defined as any person directly or indirectly owning,
                                             controlling, or holding, with power to vote, 5% or more of the outstanding shares of
                                             the investment company. An affiliated person also includes any person directly or
                                             indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the investment
                                             company or any officer, director, partner, or employee of the investment company.
                                             However, while technically considered an affiliated person, no person is deemed to be
                                             an “interested person” for purposes of the maximum percentage of interested persons
                                             on the board solely by reason of being a member of the fund’s board of directors or
                                             an owner of its securities. A person is deemed to be a control person when owning or
                                             controlling more than 25% of the outstanding shares.
                                                                                                                                          Unit 3
                                   Custodian
                                   Every registered investment company is required to keep its assets with a custodian. In the
                                   majority of cases, that custodian is a bank; hence the common use of the term custodian bank.
                                   Although the act specifies certain financial requirements for that bank, it does not require that
                                   the bank have FDIC coverage. Alternatively, the investment company may use a broker-dealer
                                   that is a member firm of a national securities exchange.


                                   Redemption of Shares of Mutual Funds
                                   Upon request of the investor, the Investment Company Act of 1940 requires that the proceeds
                                   be sent in no more than seven days. The investor receives the next computed NAV per share
                                   using the forward pricing principle (described at LO 3.c).


                                   Periodic and Other Reports
                                   All investment companies must file annual financial reports with the SEC. These reports
                                   contain an audited balance sheet and income statement. In addition, shareholders must be
                                   sent financial information semiannually.

                                   Knowing what is prohibited and what is required is often tested on the exam. Here is an
                                   example expressing ideas that are likely to be tested:

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                        ABC is an FINRA member broker-dealer. Among other functions, it serves as the
                                                        principal underwriter of the XYZ Mutual Fund. Which of the following transactions of
                                                        ABC would be prohibited?
                                                         A. ABC tenders, from its investment account, 500 shares of the XYZ Mutual Fund
                                                              for redemption.
                                                         B. ABC purchases, for its investment account, 500 shares of XYZ Mutual Fund.
                                                         C. ABC purchases some securities directly from XYZ’s portfolio.
                                                         D. All of these.
                                                        Answer: C. It would be a violation of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for any
                                                        affiliated person, such as the principal underwriter, to purchase any security from
                                                        an investment company other than shares of the fund itself. Investing in the fund’s
                                                        shares would be permitted, not prohibited.


                                                   KNOWLEDGE CHECK 3.1
                                                   1.   Which of the following statements correctly expresses requirements under the
                                                        Investment Company Act of 1940?
                                                           I. A registered open-end investment company using a bank as custodian must
                                                              choose one that has FDIC coverage.
                                                          II. If an affiliated person of a registered investment company wishes to borrow
                                                              money from the fund, there must be at least 300% asset coverage.
                                                         III. No investment advisory contract may be entered into that does not provide for
                                                              termination with no more than 60 days’ notice in writing.

          LESSON 3.2: PRICING OF FUND SHARES

                                      LO 3.b Compare the method of capitalization and pricing of open-end
                                      investment companies and closed-end investment companies.


                                      Open-End Investment Companies—Initial Capitalization
                                      An open-end investment company or mutual fund does not specify the exact number of
                                      shares it intends to issue. It registers an open offering with the SEC. The open-end investment
                                      company can raise an unlimited amount of investment capital by continuously issuing new
                                      shares. As a consequence, investors in mutual funds are always purchasing a new issue: a




03_0-2532_LEM_65E_Unit03.indd 60                                                                                                               28/10/22 12:31 PM

                                   primary offering with the money going to the issuer (the mutual fund). One other point
                                   is that open-end companies can only issue common stock. The money raised from the
                                   issuance of that common stock is then used by the portfolio manager(s) to invest in securities
                                   meeting that fund’s objectives. For example, a mutual fund seeking income would likely
                                   invest a substantial portion of its capital into bonds and/or preferred stock. Don’t confuse the
                                   limitation on only issuing common stock to raise capital with what it can invest with that
                                   capital—bond funds will use the proceeds from the sale of the common shares issued to buy
                                   bonds.

                                             PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  An investor is always purchasing newly issued shares of common stock when
                                                  investing in
                                                    A. a closed-end investment company.
                                                    B. an open-end investment company (mutual fund).
                                                    C. a unit investment trust (UIT).
                                                    D. a holding company.
                                                  Answer: B. A unique characteristic of mutual funds is that they are capitalized by a
                                                  continuous offering of new shares. Whenever an investor adds to her portfolio, she
                                                  is buying new shares of common stock issued by that fund. In a UIT, the investor is
                                                  purchasing units, not shares.


                                             TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                             Because mutual funds are a continuous new offering, the prospectus must be
                                             distributed to a prospective investor before or during any solicitation for sale.
                                                                                                                                              Unit 3
                                   Closed-End Investment Companies—Initial Capitalization
                                   As we stated, the primary difference between the two categories of management companies
                                   (closed-end and open-end) is the way in which they raise capital and subsequently trade. To
                                   raise capital, a closed-end investment company conducts a common stock offering. For the
                                   initial offering, the company registers a fixed number of shares with the SEC and offers them
                                   to the public for a limited time through an underwriting group in a manner the same as any
                                   corporate stock offering. The fund’s capitalization is fixed unless an additional public offering
                                   is made at a later time. Closed-end investment companies can also issue bonds and preferred
                                   stock. Therefore, the capital structure of a closed-end company can resemble that of any other
                                   corporation—common stock, preferred stock, and bonds.


                                   Pricing of Closed-End Investment Company Shares
                                   Closed-end investment companies are commonly known as publicly traded funds. After
                                   the stock is distributed, anyone can buy or sell shares in the secondary market, either on an
                                   exchange or over the counter (OTC). Supply and demand determine the bid price (price at
                                   which an investor can sell) and the ask price (price at which an investor can buy). Closed-end
                                   fund shares usually trade at a premium or discount to the shares’ net asset value (NAV).

                                                   Please remember the following points:
                                                    Closed-end investment companies trade based upon supply and demand for
                                                      their shares. As a result, their buying and selling price does not have a direct
                                                      relationship to the NAV of the shares. Put another way, the market price of a
                                                      closed-end fund is independent of the fund’s NAV.
                                                    Country funds are funds that concentrate their investments in the securities of
                                                      companies domiciled in foreign countries. Well-known examples are the Korea
                                                      Fund, the New Germany Fund, and the Mexico Fund. These country funds are
                                                      generally organized as closed-end (rather than open-end) companies because
                                                      it is often difficult to liquidate foreign securities to get their value into the United
                                                      States.


                                      Pricing of Open-End Investment Company Shares
                                      When it comes to open-end investment companies (mutual funds), any person who wants
                                      to invest in the company buys shares directly from the company or its underwriters (or a
                                      broker-dealer with a selling agreement) at the public offering price (POP). A mutual fund’s
                                      POP is the net asset value per share (NAV) plus any applicable sales charges. A mutual fund’s
                                      net assets are calculated daily by deducting the fund’s liabilities from its total assets. NAV per
                                      share is calculated by dividing the fund’s net assets by the number of shares outstanding.

                                      An open-end investment company sells redeemable securities. When an investor sells shares,
                                      the company redeems them at their NAV. For each share an investor redeems, the company
                                      sends the investor money for the investor’s proportionate share of the company’s net assets.
                                      Therefore, a mutual fund’s capital shrinks when investors redeem shares.

                                      Each investor’s share in the fund’s performance is based on the number of shares owned.
                                      Mutual fund shares may be purchased in either full or fractional units, unlike stock, which
                                      may be purchased in full units only. Because mutual fund shares can be fractional, the investor
                                      can think in terms of dollars rather than number of shares owned. Because closed-end funds
                                      trade like any other corporate stock, fractional shares are not available.

                                             We said earlier that closed-end funds also compute NAV; however, because their price
                                             is determined by supply and demand and, as a consequence, may be more than, the
                                             same as, or less than the NAV, the NAV does not have the relevance that it does with
                                             open-end funds. Therefore, instead of daily computation, it is generally only done
                                             once per week.


                                   Forward Pricing
                                   Open-end investment companies (mutual funds) must compute their net asset value (NAV)
                                   per share at least once per day (very few compute more than that) as of the close of the
                                   markets (generally 4:00 pm ET). Price determination for purchases and sales is based on the
                                   forward pricing principle. That is, whenever an order, whether to purchase or redeem shares,
                                   is received, the price is based on the next computed NAV per share. For example, any order
                                   received (and time stamped) prior to 4:00 pm ET will be executed at the price computed as of
                                   that day’s market close. If the order is received at 4:00 pm (or later), it will be executed based
                                   on the NAV computed as of 4:00 pm the next business day.

                                             EXAMPLE
                                             If NavCo Mutual Fund shares are $15 per share, a $100 investment buys 6.667 shares
                                             ($100 ¸ $15 = 6.667).

                                   An investment company’s portfolio is elastic. Money is simultaneously invested into the fund
                                   and paid out when shares are redeemed. The mutual fund portfolio’s value and holdings
                                                                                                                                               Unit 3
                                   fluctuate as money is invested or shares are redeemed and as the value of the securities held by
                                   the portfolio rises and falls. The investor’s account value fluctuates proportionately with the
                                   mutual fund portfolio’s value.

                                             PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  Daniella has a number of investment company products within her retirement
                                                  portfolio. One of these investments trades on an exchange and may trade at a
                                                  premium or discount to its net asset value. These features are most likely found in
                                                  what type of investment?
                                                   A. Closed-end investment company

                                                   D. Face-amount certificate company
                                                  Answer: A. A closed-end investment company (closed-end fund, or CEF) is a type
                                                  of investment company whose shares trade in the secondary market. It is critical to
                                                  remember for the exam that the price of the shares of a closed-end company is based
                                                  on supply and demand and, therefore, can sell at, above, or below the fund’s net
                                                  asset value.

                                      LO 3.c Contrast the mutual fund share classes and relate them to the
                                      different types of loads charged to fund investors.


                                      Open-End Funds
                                      FINRA prohibits its members who underwrite fund shares from assessing sales charges in
                                      excess of 8.5% of the POP on the purchase of open-end investment company shares. The actual
                                      schedule of sales charges is specified in the prospectus. Sales loads, management fees, and
                                      operating expenses reduce an investor’s returns because they diminish the amount of money
                                      invested in a fund. Historically, mutual funds have charged front-end loads of up to 8.5% of
                                      the money invested (public offering price).

                                      Alternatively, funds may charge a back-end load when funds are withdrawn. Some funds
                                      charge ongoing fees under Section 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940. These
                                      funds deduct annual fees to pay for marketing and distribution costs.

                                      A fund’s expense ratio expresses the management fees and operating expenses as a percentage
                                      of the fund’s net assets. All mutual funds, load and no-load, have expense ratios. The expense
                                      ratio is calculated by dividing annual operating expenses by the average dollar value of
                                      the fund’s assets under management. The sales charge is not considered an expense when
                                      calculating a fund’s expense ratio.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   An expense ratio of 1.72% means that the fund spends $1.72 per year for every $100 of
                                                   invested assets.

                                      Typically, more aggressive funds have higher expense ratios.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   An aggressive growth fund’s expense ratio is usually higher than that of a fund invested
                                                   in AAA rated bonds because more trading occurs in the growth fund’s portfolio.

                                      All sales commissions are paid from the sales charges collected. Sales charges include
                                      commissions for the managing underwriter and broker-dealers and their agents who sell the
                                      fund, as well as all expenses incurred in communications with the public. The sales charge of a
                                      mutual fund is stated as a percentage of the public offering price (POP) per share.

                                      Mutual fund distributors use three different methods to collect the fees for the sale of shares:
                                       Front-end loads (difference between POP and net NAV)
                                       Back-end loads (contingent deferred sales loads)
                                       12b-1 fees (asset-based fees—technically not a sales charge, but may be referred to as an
                                         asset-based sales charge on the exam)


                                      Sales Loads
                                      Front-End Loads. Front-end sales loads are reflected in a fund’s public offering price. The
                                      charges are added to the NAV at the time an investor buys shares. They are frequently referred
                                      to as Class A shares and have lower operating expense ratios than other classes.

                                   Back-End Loads. A back-end sales load, also called a contingent deferred sales charge or load
                                   (CDSC), is charged at the time an investor redeems mutual fund shares. The sales load, a
                                   declining percentage charge that is reduced annually (for instance, 8% the first year, 7% the
                                   second, 6% the third, and so forth), is applied to the proceeds of any shares sold in that year.
                                   The back-end load is usually structured so that it drops to zero after six to eight years, at
                                   which time the shares are converted to Class A with their lower operating expense ratios. They
                                   are frequently referred to as Class B shares.

                                   12b-1 Asset-Based Fees. Mutual funds cannot act as distributors for their own fund shares
                                   except under Section 12b-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940. This provision permits
                                   a mutual fund to collect a fee for promotion or sales-related activities in connection with the
                                   distribution of its shares. The fee is determined as a percentage of the fund’s average net assets
                                   during the year. The fee is disclosed in the fund’s prospectus.

                                   The percentage of net assets charged must be reasonable (typically 0.5% of net assets—this
                                   annual fee cannot exceed 0.75% of net assets), and the fee must reflect the anticipated level
                                   of distribution services. If the fee exceeds 0.25%, the fund cannot use the term no-load (no
                                   front-end or back-end load).

                                   In order to charge a 12b-1 fee, there are several specific requirements in the law. There must
                                   be a written plan, and this written plan must meet the following requirements:
                                    The plan has been approved initially by a vote of at least a majority of the outstanding
                                      voting securities of the investment company.
                                    The plan, together with any related agreements, has been approved initially and
                                      reapproved at least annually by a vote of the board of directors of the company, and of the
                                      directors who are not interested persons of the company (the outside directors).
                                    The plan may be terminated at any time by a vote of the majority of the members of the               Unit 3
                                      board of directors of the company who are not interested persons of the company, or by a
                                      vote of the majority of the shareholders of the company.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              The 12b-1 fee is used for marketing and distribution purposes only. None of that
                                              money is used to pay the for the fund’s portfolio management.


                                   Classes of Fund Shares
                                   Mutual funds may offer several classes of shares to allow investors to select how they pay the
                                   sales charges. The following is a typical method by which firms may classify fund shares by fee
                                   type: Class A, B, and C shares.
                                    Class A shares (front-end load): investors pay the charge at the time of purchase.
                                    Class B shares (back-end load): declines over time so investors pay the charge at
                                      redemption.
                                    Class C shares (level load): no sales charge to purchase; generally a 1% CDSC for one
                                      year, with a continuous 12b-1 charge.

                                   The class of shares determines the type of sales charge as well as operating expenses, with Class
                                   A having lower costs (usually a low or no 12b-1 fee) than Class B and Class C shares. All
                                   other rights associated with mutual fund ownership remain the same across each class.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   The authors of test questions are generally slow to react to industry developments.
                                                   For example, this is what FINRA says about Class C shares: “Class C shares typically
                                                   impose higher asset-based sales charges than Class A shares, and because their
                                                   shares generally do not convert into Class A shares, their asset-based sales charge
                                                   will not be reduced over time.” Those asset-based sales charges are the 12b-1 fees.
                                                   In recent years, there has been a growing trend for mutual fund sponsors to provide
                                                   for conversion of C shares to A shares in a manner similar to B shares. The difference
                                                   is that the time for conversion is generally eight to ten years rather than the six to
                                                   eight years for Class B conversion to Class A shares. Until this becomes the industry
                                                   standard, for test purposes, Class C shares do not convert to Class A shares.


                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   In recent years, a number of other share classes have emerged, covering virtually the
                                                   entire alphabet. As of the printing of this text, the only ones we are aware of possibly
                                                   appearing on the exam are:
                                                    Class I shares, which would be sold only to institutional investors (hence the
                                                      letter I), and usually have lower fees and expenses.
                                                    Class R shares, which would be sold only to participants in retirement plans, such
                                                      as a 401(k), and have no front-end or back-end load, but may have a 12b-1 fee
                                                      that is lower than Class B and Class C shares, but higher than Class A shares.


                                      Reductions in Sales Charges
                                      There are two ways that an investor can take advantage of reduced sales charges available on
                                      Class A shares for larger purchases.
                                       Breakpoints—a scale of declining sales charges based on the amount invested
                                       Rights of accumulation—permits an investor to aggregate shares owned in related
                                         accounts in some or all funds in the fund family to reach a breakpoint discount with no
                                         time limit.


                                      Breakpoints
                                      The schedule of discounts a mutual fund offers is called the fund’s breakpoints. Breakpoints
                                      are available to any person. For a breakpoint qualification, the term any person includes
                                      married couples, parents and their minor children, and corporations. Investment clubs or
                                      associations formed for the purpose of investing do not qualify for breakpoints.

                                   Breakpoint Sales
                                   Both state and federal regulators prohibit registered personnel from making higher
                                   commissions by selling investment company shares in a dollar amount just below the point
                                   at which the sales charge is reduced. This is known as a breakpoint sale, and this practice is
                                   considered contrary to just and equitable principles of trade. For example, using the above
                                   chart, if an order for $24,000 was taken without indicating to the investor that an additional
                                   $1,000 would save $250 in sales charges (1% reduction on $25,000), it would likely be
                                   considered a violation.

                                             TAKE NOTE
                                             Although not specifically listed as a violation, regulators scrutinize large purchases of
                                             Class B shares. A purchase large enough to reach a significant Class A share breakpoint
                                             results in a low enough sales charge that, in just a few years, the lower operating
                                             expenses of the Class A shares will more than make up the difference in front-end cost.
                                             In practice, very few firms will accept an order for Class B shares in excess of $100,000,
                                             particularly if the investor intends to maintain the position for a number of years.


                                   Letter of Intent (LOI)
                                   A person who plans to invest more money with the same mutual fund company may decrease
                                   overall sales charges by signing a letter of intent (LOI). In the LOI, the investor informs the
                                   investment company that he intends to invest the additional funds necessary to reach the
                                   breakpoint within 13 months.

                                   The LOI is a one-sided contract binding on the fund only. The customer must complete the
                                   intended investment to qualify for the reduced sales charge. The fund holds the extra shares              Unit 3
                                   purchased as a result of the reduced sales charge in escrow. If the customer deposits sufficient
                                   money to complete the LOI, he receives the escrowed shares. Appreciation and reinvested
                                   dividends do not count toward the LOI.

                                             EXAMPLE
                                             Using the sample breakpoint schedule displayed above, a customer investing $20,000
                                             is under the $25,000 breakpoint. The customer might sign a letter of intent promising
                                             an amount that will qualify for the breakpoint within 13 months from the date of
                                             the letter. An additional $5,000 invested in the fund within 13 months qualifies the
                                             customer for the reduced sales charge. Each deposit is charged the reduced sales
                                             charge at the time of purchase.

                                   If the customer has not completed the investment within 13 months, he will be given the
                                   choice of sending a check for the difference in sales charges or cashing in escrowed shares to
                                   pay the difference.

                                   A fund often permits a customer to sign an LOI as late as 90 days after an initial purchase.
                                   The LOI may be backdated by up to 90 days to include prior purchases but may not cover
                                   more than 13 months in total. This means that if the customer signs the LOI after 60 days, he
                                   has 11 months to complete the letter.

                                      Rights of Accumulation
                                      Rights of accumulation allow an investor to combine previous investments in the fund with
                                      today’s investment to determine today’s sales charge.

                                      The primary ways in which rights of accumulation differ from a letter of intent are they:
                                       are available for subsequent investments (the reduced sales charges will not apply to initial
                                         transactions);
                                       do not require making a specific commitment for future investment;
                                       allow the investor to use prior share appreciation to qualify for breakpoints; and
                                       do not impose time limits.
                                      The customer may qualify for reduced charges when the total value of shares previously
                                      purchased and shares currently being purchased exceed a specific breakpoint amount. For
                                      the purpose of qualifying customers for rights of accumulation, the mutual fund bases the
                                      quantity of securities owned on the higher of current NAV or the total of purchases made
                                      to date. Referring back to the sample breakpoint schedule, once an investor accumulates
                                      $100,000 in the fund by the greater of dollar amount of purchases or current value at NAV,
                                      each additional investment, no matter how small and with no time limit, qualifies for the
                                      breakpoint sales charge—in this case, 3%.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   When discussing investment companies, the term sales load most commonly refers to
                                                   A. the fund’s sales charge, expressed as a percentage of the NAV.
                                                   B. the fund’s sales charge, expressed as a percentage of the public offering price.
                                                   C. the commission earned by the broker-dealer making the sale.
                                                   D. the 12b-1 fee.
                                                   Answer: B. Class A shares of an open-end investment company (mutual fund) have a
                                                   “front-end” sales charge, or sales load, which is computed as a percentage of the public
                                                   offering price. That is, if the fund’s POP is $10 and the NAV is $9.50, the 50-cent sales
                                                   charge is 5% of the $10 offering price. In general, the majority of the sales load is paid to
                                                   the broker-dealer making the sale as compensation. The 12b-1 fee is never referred to as a
                                                   sales load because it is not related to the sale of shares. However, you will see the phrase
                                                   asset-based sales charge.


                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                       Barbara wishes to invest in the KAPCO Growth Fund, an open-end investment
                                                       company. She expects to hold the shares for at least 10 years. If she purchases
                                                       KAPCO’s Class A shares, each of these would be a way for her to receive a reduction
                                                       on the sales charge except
                                                        A. a single investment that reaches a breakpoint.
                                                        B. joining together with her sister to make a purchase at a breakpoint level.
                                                        C. signing a letter of intent.
                                                        D. benefiting from the right of accumulation.
                                                       Answer: B. Reaching a breakpoint is the way in which investors can receive a “break”
                                                       on the sales load charged when purchasing Class A shares. Purchases may be
                                                       combined with spouses and dependent children, but not other family members, such
                                                       as siblings, making the exception here. The three ways to reach a breakpoint are:

                                                        a lump-sum purchase;
                                                        using a letter of intent granting 13 months to reach the breakpoint; or
                                                        taking advantage of rights of accumulation (no time limit).

                                                  executed at a public offering price of $10 per share. From this information, you know
                                                  that the sales charge is

             LESSON 3.3: PRIVATE FUNDS

                                   LO 3.d Identify the characteristics of private funds and venture
                                   capital funds.

                                   Private funds, generally referred to as private equity funds, limit their ownership so as not
                                   to be considered investment companies. As long as there are no more than 100 investors,
                                   the law does not consider these investment companies requiring registration—that is the                    Unit 3
                                   3(c)(1) fund exemption. There is another exemption without a limit on the number of
                                   investors. However, for this exemption, the 3(c)(7) exemption, all investors must be qualified
                                   purchasers. Qualified purchasers are individuals with at least $5 million in investments, or
                                   business entities with at least $25 million in investments. Most private funds are organized
                                   as partnerships rather than corporations. One special kind of private fund is the hedge fund,
                                   which will be covered shortly. One difference between hedge funds and other private funds
                                   is the anticipated holding period of the investments. Hedge funds tend to take a more active
                                   trading role where their positions are traded actively over a short time period. Conversely,
                                   private funds generally hold their investments for the long run.

                                   Private funds can be separated into two different categories: those that make direct
                                   investments and those that make portfolio investments. What is the difference? In the first
                                   case, the funds have a 10% or greater voting interest in an operating company (one that is
                                   actually in operation) with the goal of influencing management and operations. In the latter
                                   case, the fund does not acquire a control position and builds a portfolio that may be stocks,
                                   bonds, derivatives, or any combination of these.

                                   One specific type of private fund that is becoming increasingly more popular is the private
                                   liquidity fund. Private liquidity funds are defined by the SEC as “any private fund that seeks
                                   to generate income by investing in a portfolio of short-term obligations in order to maintain
                                   a stable net asset value (NAV) per unit or minimize principal volatility for investors.” If
                                   that sounds like a money market mutual fund (MMF), it should. In 2014, a number of
                                   restrictions, such as requiring a floating NAV (probably not tested), were placed on certain
                                   money market funds. In order to avoid those, the industry developed these private funds,
                                   which, being exempt from SEC registration, are also exempt from those restrictions. Because

                                      they are unregistered, less information is publicly available about these funds compared to a
                                      traditional MMF that reports its holdings on a monthly basis.

                                      Venture capital (VC) funds are also generally organized as limited partnerships where the
                                      investment decisions are made by the general partner with the capital coming from the
                                      limited partners. Those LPs can be wealthy individuals, pension and endowment funds, and
                                      even hedge funds. VC funds look for young, up-and-coming companies with an expectation
                                      of high returns in exchange for the high risk. Unlike private equity funds, it is more typical
                                      that venture capital fund investments are made in businesses that are not yet fully operational.
                                      The funding (and sometimes management guidance) provided has the goal of developing an
                                      exit strategy in 10 years or less.

                                      One common characteristic of private equity and venture capital funds is the compensation
                                      to the fund manager. Typically, the annual management fee is 2% of committed capital plus
                                      20% of the profits when the business is sold. This is usually referred to as the carried interest.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                     One of your friends is an entrepreneur who is looking for a way to raise capital for her
                                                     fledgling business. Because the enterprise has no operating history, it is most likely
                                                     that her best bet would be to approach
                                                       A. a hedge fund.
                                                       B. a mutual fund.
                                                       C. a private equity fund.
                                                       D. a venture capital fund.
                                                     Answer: D. When a business is in the pre-operating stage, it is of most interest to
                                                     venture capitalists. Private equity funds, including hedge funds, invariably invest in
                                                     going concerns, and mutual funds are almost always limited to purchasing securities
                                                     that are marketable.



                                      LO 3.e Identify the structure, compensation arrangements, and
                                      suitability requirements of a hedge fund.


                                      Hedge Funds
                                      Hedge funds are a form of fund generally organized as a limited partnership with no more
                                      than 100 investors that does not have to register with the SEC, although the portfolio
                                      managers generally are required to register as investment advisers. Because there is no
                                      registration requirement, one of the differences between a mutual fund and a hedge fund is
                                      the hedge fund’s lack of transparency; a mutual fund is offered via a prospectus filed with
                                      the SEC, while a hedge fund’s prospectus is generally referred to as a private placement
                                      memorandum, containing significantly less information.

                                      Hedge funds are free to adopt far riskier investment policies than those permitted to open-end
                                      and closed-end funds, such as arbitrage strategies and massive short positions during bearish
                                      markets. In addition, they may use leverage (borrowed money) and derivatives such as options
                                      and futures. Even though these risky techniques are employed, the primary aim of most hedge
                                      funds is to reduce volatility and risk while attempting to preserve capital and deliver positive
                                      returns under all market conditions.

                                                                                                      Unit 3   Pooled Investments      71


                                   Another important factor is that management fees tend to be much, much higher than with
                                   other investments. Almost all hedge funds charge performance-based fees. The typical fee
                                   structure is known by the vernacular “2 and 20”—most funds take a 2% management fee and
                                   20% of any profits. Fund compensation agreements may also contain a hurdle rate, where the
                                   incentive fee will only be paid if the fund return exceeds a set threshold return (e.g., 4%).

                                   Many hedge funds also require that investors maintain the investment for a minimum length
                                   of time (e.g., one year) and, to that extent, they can be considered illiquid. These requirements
                                   are known as lock-up provisions. This provision provides that, during a certain initial period,
                                   an investor may not make a withdrawal from the fund—the investor’s capital is locked up.
                                   Generally recognized as one way the manager of the hedge fund portfolio can have capital
                                   retained in the fund, it is also seen to be another factor adding to the unique risk of hedge
                                   funds—in this case, shares being illiquid for that specified length of time.

                                   Therefore, because of the higher risk, investment in these vehicles is limited to institutional
                                   clients and wealthy individuals known as accredited investors (defined in Unit 8).

                                             TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                             Hedge funds have very high initial investment minimums. Although there are some
                                             that will accept as little as $25,000 and more that will take $100,000, the general
                                             minimum ranges from $500,000 to $1 million. We’ve seen some with a minimum of
                                             $25 million. The exam will want you to know that the high minimum is a reason why
                                             these funds are suitable for only a small percentage of investors.

                                             Most hedge funds are organized as limited partnerships with the portfolio managers               Unit 3
                                             investing along with the investors. As they say in the industry, they have “skin in the
                                             game,” so they have a greater motivation to succeed. The partnership is the issuer of
                                             the ownership units.


                                             PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  Which type of investment company is most often organized as a limited partnership?
                                                   A. Face-amount certificate company

                                                   D. Unit investment trust
                                                  Answer: C. For various legal reasons, mostly related to the need to avoid registration
                                                  with the SEC, hedge funds are generally structured as limited partnership entities,
                                                  with the organizers invariably sinking their own funds into a few units.


                                   Fund of Hedge Funds
                                   With minimum purchase requirements as low as $2,500, hedge funds are indirectly available
                                   to ordinary investors through funds of hedge funds. This offers the investor diversification
                                   because the fund of funds (FOF) will contain several different hedge funds. Because
                                   hedge funds themselves have limited liquidity, purchasing a FOF does not add significant
                                   liquidity for the investor; the seven-day redemption requirement is waived for these funds.
                                   Furthermore, in addition to the fees charged by the hedge funds in the portfolio, the FOF has
                                   expenses as well.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                        You may be required to know what hedge funds and mutual funds have in common.
                                                        Which of the following would you choose?
                                                         A. A high degree of transparency
                                                         B. Relatively low management costs
                                                         C. A pooled investment with other investors
                                                         D. High liquidity
                                                        Answer: C. From what we’ve covered, you should have seen that hedge funds do
                                                        not offer the transparency of mutual funds. The key to getting that point is that they
                                                        are not registered with the SEC, so the disclosures that must be made are limited.
                                                        The management fees for hedge funds are much higher than mutual funds and,
                                                        due to the lock-up period, their liquidity is questionable. However, the common
                                                        characteristic is that they are pooled investments.

                                                        rather than actual operating results?

                                                         A. a closed-end investment management company.
                                                         B. a corporation.
                                                         C. an open-end investment management company.
                                                         D. a partnership.

                                      The third of the entities meeting the definition of an investment company under the
                                      Investment Company Act is the unit investment trust. A unit investment trust (UIT) is an
                                      unmanaged investment company organized under a trust indenture. UITs:
                                       do not have boards of directors;
                                       do not employ an investment adviser; and
                                       do not actively manage their own portfolios (trade securities).
                                      A unit investment trust issues only redeemable securities, known as units or shares of
                                      beneficial interest, each of which represents an undivided interest in a portfolio of specified
                                      securities. The trustees use the investor’s money to purchase securities designed to meet the
                                      UIT’s stated objective. Without an investment adviser (management), once compiled, the
                                      portfolio remains fixed. An example of a UIT is one solely invested in municipal bonds where
                                      the trust liquidates after the final bond in the portfolio matures. There are also equity trusts
                                      where, because stock doesn’t mature, the portfolio is liquidated at a predetermined date and
                                      the proceeds distributed to unit holders or reinvested into a new trust at the investor’s option.

                                   Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the trustees must maintain secondary markets
                                   in the units, thus allowing unit holders the ability to redeem their units at net asset value
                                   (NAV). Some exchange-traded funds (ETFs—covered later in this unit) are organized as UITs
                                   and trade, as the name implies, on exchanges or Nasdaq.

                                             TAKE NOTE
                                             Know the following features of UITs.
                                              UITs are not actively managed; there is no board of directors (BOD) or investment
                                                adviser.
                                              UIT shares (units) must be redeemed by the trust.
                                              UITs are investment companies as defined under the Investment Company Act
                                                of 1940.


                                             PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                 Louis owns an investment that is an unmanaged portfolio in which the money
                                                 manager initially selects the securities to be included in the portfolio, and then
                                                 holds those securities until they mature or the investment portfolio terminates. This
                                                 statement best describes which type of investment?
                                                   A. Closed-end investment company
                                                   B. Face-amount certificate company
                                                   C. Open-end investment company
                                                  D. Unit investment trust
                                                 Answer: D. A unit investment trust (UIT) is a type of investment company which is
                                                 generally unmanaged as the money manager initially selects the securities to be
                                                 included in the portfolio and then holds those securities until they mature or the UIT     Unit 3
                                                 terminates.


                                   LO 3.g Identify the distinguishing characteristics of exchange-traded
                                   funds (ETFs).

                                   An exchange-traded fund (ETF) registers with the SEC under the Investment Company
                                   Act of 1940 either as a unit investment trust (a UIT ETF) or as an open-end management
                                   company (an open-end ETF).

                                   This type of fund generally invests in a specific index, such as the S&P 500. Any class of
                                   assets that has a published index around it and is liquid can be made into an ETF so that
                                   there are ETFs for real estate and commodities as well as stocks and bonds. In this way, an
                                   ETF is similar to an index mutual fund. The difference is that the ETF trades like a stock on
                                   an exchange or Nasdaq and, in this way, is similar to a closed-end investment company. The
                                   investor can take advantage of price changes that are due to the market rather than just the
                                   underlying value of the stocks in the portfolio.

          74         Unit 3   Pooled Investments



                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   Although, as stated, most ETFs are passive in that they are based on some index,
                                                   in recent years, there has been a growth in actively managed ETFs where, instead
                                                   of attempting to mirror an index, the managers select individual assets based on
                                                   expected performance. This concept will make more sense after you read Unit 21,
                                                   which explains passive and active portfolio management styles.

                                      ETFs can be purchased on margin and sold short (covered in Unit 23) just like any other listed
                                      stock. This is another difference between ETFs and mutual funds. ETF expenses tend to be lower
                                      than those of mutual funds as well, because all the adviser has to do is match up to the specified
                                      index, so the fees are minimal. In addition, there can be tax advantages to owning ETFs.

                                      However, because there are brokerage commissions on each trade (in and out), ETFs are
                                      generally not competitive with a no-load index fund for the small investor making regular
                                      periodic investments, such as in a dollar cost averaging plan (described in Unit 21).

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   There are now some U.S.-listed ETFs available for commission-free trading on certain
                                                   select platforms (these are typically proprietary funds). These products can be
                                                   bought and sold without traditional brokerage commissions for investors with certain
                                                   accounts and are subject to certain restrictions. Obviously, if there are no trading
                                                   costs, the objection to using them in dollar cost averaging programs is eliminated. For
                                                   exam purposes, these are the exceptions rather than the rule.

                                      Most ETFs are legally classified as open-end companies (although those cannot be referred to
                                      as mutual funds because shares are not redeemable), with the rest as unit investment trusts.

                                      Unlike the CEF (closed-end fund), where the market price will generally vary quite a bit from
                                      the NAV because those prices are determined by supply and demand, there are occasions
                                      where persistent small premiums and discounts arise in ETFs, but that is due to a structural
                                      inconsistency. Under normal circumstances, the premium and discount that arises between an
                                      ETF’s NAV and its trading price at the end of the day is the result of late-in-the-day market
                                      activity and will narrow at the opening on the following trading day.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                       Which of the following is not touted as an advantage to purchasing ETFs instead of
                                                       index mutual funds?
                                                         A. Intra-day trading
                                                         B. Typically lower expense ratios
                                                         C. Better general performance than the underlying index
                                                         D. Can be purchased on margin
                                                       Answer: C. One thing that neither of these products can claim is performance
                                                       better than the underlying index. Think about it: the index has no management
                                                       fees. Even though the management fees on index funds are very low and those on
                                                       ETFs generally lower than that, there are still expenses making it unlikely that their
                                                       performance can beat that of the index. The fact that an investor can trade the ETF
                                                       during the day instead of accepting whatever the next computed price is can be a
                                                       benefit for those who are trying to time the market. And for those who wish to add
                                                       the leverage of margin trading (explained more fully in Unit 23), that can only be done
                                                       with ETFs, not index mutual funds.

                                   LO 3.h Identify the unique features of real estate investment trusts
                                   (REITs).

                                   A real estate investment trust (REIT, pronounced “reet”) is a company that manages
                                   a portfolio of real estate investments to earn profits and/or income for its shareholders.
                                   Like many other pooled investment vehicles, REITs offer professional management and
                                   diversification. REITs are normally publicly traded and serve as a source of long-term
                                   financing for real estate projects. A REIT pools capital in a manner similar to an investment
                                   company. Shareholders receive dividends from investment income or capital gains
                                   distributions. In most cases, those dividends are taxed at ordinary income rates rather than as
                                   qualified dividends. Capital gains distributions are generally taxed at the favorable long-term
                                   capital gains rate. Please note that with the advent of the TCJA of 2017 (the Tax Cuts and
                                   Jobs Act), there are some complex tax issues with REITs, and those are not likely to be tested.
                                   REITs normally:
                                    own commercial property (equity REITs);
                                    own mortgages on commercial property (mortgage REITs); or
                                    do both (hybrid REITs).
                                   REITs are organized as trusts in which investors buy and sell shares either on stock exchanges
                                   or in the over-the-counter market; they are not redeemable as is the case with mutual funds or
                                   UITs.

                                   REITs enjoy a unique hybrid status for federal income tax purposes. A REIT shareholder
                                   generally is taxed only on dividends paid by the REIT and on gains upon the disposition
                                   of REIT shares. A REIT is a corporation for U.S. tax purposes, but because it receives a                  Unit 3
                                   dividends paid deduction, the REIT generally is not subject to corporate tax if it distributes to
                                   its shareholders substantially all of its taxable income for each year.

                                   How much is “substantially all”? Under the guidelines of Subchapter M of the Internal
                                   Revenue Code, a REIT can avoid being taxed as a corporation by receiving 75% or more
                                   of its income from real estate and distributing 90% or more of its taxable income to its
                                   shareholders.

                                             TAKE NOTE
                                             There are three numbers relating to REITs that might be tested. The REIT must:
                                              Invest at least 75% of its total assets in real estate assets and cash;

                                                   In recent years, there has been substantial growth in the number of “nontraded” REITs
                                                   (limited liquidity). However, for exam purposes, assume the REIT is publicly traded
                                                   unless the question states otherwise.

                                                        would like to utilize leverage and do this purchase in a margin account. Additionally,

          LESSON 3.5: BENEFITS AND RISKS OF POOLED INVESTMENTS

                                      LO 3.i Explain the benefits and risks of pooled investments in client
                                      portfolios.

                                      As you have seen, there are many different types of pooled investment vehicles. In general,
                                      they all share several important characteristics:
                                       Diversification: By pooling assets with many others, investors have the opportunity to
                                         own an interest in a far greater number and range of securities than available to almost
                                         any individual investor.
                                       Professional management: In almost all cases, someone with expertise (we hope) is
                                         “minding the store.” Even in the case of a UIT, where there is no ongoing management,
                                         the initial portfolio is constructed by experts.

                                      The exam tends to focus on the most popular investments, such as mutual funds, so we will
                                      start with those.

                                                                                                    Unit 3   Pooled Investments    77


                                   Mutual Funds
                                   What are the benefits of including mutual funds in a client’s portfolio?
                                    Diversification: The old saying “don’t put all of your eggs in one basket” certainly applies
                                      to the benefits of diversifying one’s portfolio assets. Mutual funds are probably the easiest
                                      way to accomplish this. Although diversification may help to reduce risk, it will never
                                      completely eliminate it. It is possible to lose all or part of your investment.
                                    Professional management: Those individuals in charge of managing a mutual fund’s
                                      portfolio must be registered as investment advisers with the SEC. The Investment
                                      Company Act of 1940 requires that they follow the stated objectives set forth in the
                                      prospectus. Taking into consideration prevailing market conditions and other factors, the
                                      mutual fund manager will decide when to buy or sell securities. Rare is the individual
                                      who has the time, knowledge, or resources to compete with these professionals.
                                    Choice of objectives: Whatever an investor’s investment objectives are, there are mutual
                                      funds available to match. There are many shades of growth funds, from highly aggressive
                                      to very conservative, but all with the goal of growing the investment. The same is true
                                      with income funds where the goal is to generate current income with varying degrees of
                                      risk from government bonds to high-yield bonds. If the objective is capital preservation,
                                      money market funds fit the bill, and then there are funds that combine objectives, such as
                                      growth and income funds. There are even specialized funds (sector funds) that concentrate
                                      at least 25% of their portfolio into specific industries or geographic areas, such as a
                                      biotech fund or a Southeast Asia fund.
                                    Convenience: With most mutual funds, buying and liquidating shares, changing
                                      reinvestment options, and getting information can be accomplished conveniently by

                                                                                                                                          Unit 3
                                      going online at the fund’s website, by calling a toll-free phone number, or by mail.
                                       –– Although a fund’s shareholder is relieved of the day-to-day tasks involved in
                                          researching, buying, and selling securities, an investor will still need to evaluate
                                          a mutual fund on the basis of investment goals and risk tolerance before making
                                          a purchase decision. Investors should always read the prospectus carefully before
                                          investing in any mutual fund.
                                    Liquidity: The Investment Company Act of 1940 requires that an open-end investment
                                      company stand ready to redeem shares at the next computed NAV per share. Payment
                                      must be made within seven days of the redemption request.
                                    Minimum initial investment: As mentioned previously, it doesn’t take a great deal of
                                      wealth to get started investing in funds and, generally, once you are a shareholder, most
                                      funds permit additional investments of $100 or even less.
                                    Convenient tax information: Tax liabilities for an investor are simplified because each year
                                      the fund distributes a 1099 form explaining taxability of distributions.
                                    Combination privilege: A mutual fund company frequently offers more than one fund
                                      and refers to these multiple offerings as its family of funds. An investor seeking a reduced
                                      sales charge may be allowed to combine separate investments in two or more funds within
                                      the same family to reach a breakpoint.

                                             EXAMPLE
                                             Joe Smith has invested $15,000 in the ACE Growth Fund for retirement and $10,000
                                             in the ACE Income Fund for his children’s education. The sponsor may view the two
                                             separate expenditures as one investment totaling $25,000 when calculating the sales
                                             charge. This combined dollar amount will generally reach a breakpoint.

                                       Exchanges within a family of funds: Many investment companies offer an exchange
                                        or conversion privilege within their families of funds. This feature allows an investor
                                        to convert an investment in one fund for an equal investment in another fund in the
                                        same family at net asset value without incurring an additional sales charge. For example,
                                        someone who started investing when in their 30s or 40s by placing their money into an
                                        aggressive growth fund might consider moving into something more conservative when
                                        they reached their 50s. Once they hit their 60s and 70s, they would want to have a greater
                                        percentage of their money in income funds. By staying in the same family of funds and
                                        using the exchange or conversion privilege, all of these changes could be made free of sales
                                        loads.

                                                     TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                     Any exchange of funds is considered a sale for tax purposes. Any gains or losses are
                                                     fully reportable at the time of the exchange.


                                                     TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                     It is generally agreed that the number one advantage to investing in mutual funds is
                                                     the diversification offered.

                                      By including mutual funds in a client’s portfolio, the client would be incurring the following
                                      risks:

                                       Even with the benefits offered by diversification and professional management, market
                                        prices do fluctuate. Equity funds have market risk, whereas bond funds may be subject to
                                        interest rate risk. Unlike an individual bond that ultimately repays principal at maturity,
                                        a bond fund doesn’t have a maturity date. The only mutual fund that generally does not
                                        fluctuate in price is the money market fund, but there is a trade-off in lack of growth and
                                        low income. Not only that, but the income of a money market fund will vary, unlike that
                                        of a bank CD, which is fixed and insured by the FDIC.
                                       Fees and expenses: One must carefully analyze all of the costs involved. These include:
                                        – Sales charges, 12b-1 fees, and possible redemption fees.
                                           –       Management fees (probably the largest expense on an ongoing basis).
                                           –       The investor has no control over the manager’s timing of purchases and sales, so tax
                                                   efficiency could become an issue.

                                      Prospectuses will not contain all the costs that affect the net return on the fund. This is why it
                                      is important to compare net returns after all expenses, including taxes to the investor.

                                       Other factors: When comparing funds with similar objectives, the investor should review
                                        information regarding funds’
                                           –       services offered;
                                           –       costs;

                                    Net redemptions: It can sometimes happen, particularly during declining markets, that
                                      there is an excess of shareholder redemptions over new share purchases. This is known as
                                      net redemptions. When that occurs, the portfolio manager is put in the difficult position
                                      of having to decide which assets to liquidate when prices are falling. A fund suffering with
                                      net redemptions is probably not going to deliver your clients the performance they are
                                      seeking.


                                   Private Funds
                                   What are the benefits of including private funds in a client’s portfolio?
                                    By investing before the company matures enough for a public offering, there is an
                                      opportunity for very large profits.
                                    Many private funds are structured so as to give the investors a say in the management and
                                      development of the company.
                                    Added diversification, because these usually have a low correlation to the overall market.
                                   In doing so, the client would be incurring the following risks:
                                    Business risk—A high percentage of start-ups do not succeed, and the investors lose most
                                      or all of their investment
                                    Liquidity risk—There is rarely an opportunity to find a secondary market, and even when
                                      the company has a public offering, these investors’ shares are likely to be restricted
                                    Lack of transparency—Being unregistered securities, no regulatory body has reviewed the
                                      offering documents
                                                                                                                                          Unit 3

                                   What are the benefits of including hedge funds in a client’s portfolio?
                                    The designed strategy of many hedge funds is to generate positive returns in both rising
                                      and falling markets.
                                    With a large variety of available investment styles, investors have a plethora of choices to
                                      assist them in meeting their objectives.
                                    As part of an asset allocation class, hedge funds may reduce overall portfolio risk and
                                      volatility and increase returns.
                                    A proper selection of hedge funds can create uncorrelated returns, adding a level of
                                      diversification.

                                   In doing so, the client would be incurring the following risks:
                                    Expenses can be quite high.
                                    The risky strategies could backfire, leading to significant loss of capital.
                                    Liquidity risk: during the lock-up period, the investor is locked in to the investment.
                                      Furthermore, even after that period, there is no active secondary market for these
                                      unregistered securities; they are not listed on any exchanges.
                                    Finally, as is generally the case with limited partnership investments, the sale of
                                      partnership interests may require approval of the general partner.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                     Julia, an analyst for a large investment advisory firm, is analyzing various policies
                                                     utilized by hedge funds recommended by her firm. Julia has summarized the policies
                                                     as follows:
                                                     Policy 1: During the fundraising period, each new investor must contribute a
                                                     minimum of $500,000 to the fund.
                                                     Policy 2: The hedge fund manager will return incentive fees to investors in the event
                                                     that the minimum required return is not met.
                                                     Policy 3: Investors must provide redemption requests to the hedge fund manager at
                                                     least 60 days before the funds are to be withdrawn.
                                                     Policy 4: New investors may not withdraw funds during the first 6 months that the
                                                     funds are invested with the hedge fund manager.
                                                     Which of the policies identified by Julia specifies a lock-up period?
                                                      A. Policy 1
                                                      B. Policy 2
                                                      C. Policy 3
                                                      D. Policy 4
                                                     Answer: D. A lock-up period refers to a set period of time, such as 6 months, that an
                                                     investor’s funds must remain invested in the hedge fund. During that time period,
                                                     withdrawal requests are not permitted.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                     One of your clients wishes to invest in a hedge fund. You should explain which of the
                                                     following points?
                                                       A. Shares of these funds are easy to redeem.
                                                       B. The fund can be expected to generate a profit whether the markets trend up or
                                                           trend down.
                                                       C. These funds purchase a large amount of preferred stock.
                                                       D. Expenses for these funds tend to be higher than those for traditional mutual
                                                           funds.
                                                     Answer: D. Hedge funds typically use risky strategies to generate profit regardless
                                                     of market direction, but there is no assurance that the objective will be realized.
                                                     Redemption may be difficult with these funds, and higher management fees make for
                                                     higher expenses than traditional mutual funds.


                                      REITs
                                      What are the benefits of including REITs in a client’s portfolio?
                                       The opportunity to invest in real estate without the degree of liquidity risk found in direct
                                         ownership
                                       Properties selected by professionals with greater negotiating power than an individual
                                       A negative correlation to the general stock market because real estate prices and the stock
                                         market frequently move in opposite directions
                                       Reasonable income and/or potential capital appreciation
                                      By placing REITs in a client’s portfolio, the client would be incurring the following risks:
                                       Lower control, because much of the risk in investing in REITs lies with the quality of the
                                         management.

                                    REITs generally have greater price volatility than direct ownership of real estate because
                                      they are influenced by stock market conditions.
                                    Dividends are not considered qualified for purposes of the 15% maximum tax rate and
                                      are taxed at full ordinary income rates.
                                    If a REIT is not publicly traded, liquidity is very limited. While a portion of total shares
                                      outstanding may be redeemable each year, subject to limitations, redemption offers may
                                      be priced below the purchase price or current price. As a result, there is the need for more
                                      stringent suitability standards, and the regulators give greater scrutiny to trades in unlisted
                                      REITs.
                                    Failure to meet the distribution rules could cause a REIT to be taxed (review LO 3.h).
                                    Problem loans in the portfolio could cause income and/or capital to decrease.

                                             PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  In order for a REIT to avoid being taxed like a corporation, it must distribute at least
                                                    A. 75% of its taxable income.
                                                    B. 90% of its taxable income.
                                                    C. 95% of its taxable income.
                                                    D. 100% of its taxable income.
                                                  Answer: B. In order to qualify under IRS regulations, REITs must distribute at least
                                                  90% of their taxable income in the form of dividends to shareholders. At least 75% of
                                                  a REIT’s income must come from real estate investments.

                                                    A. better performance than investing in individual securities.
                                                   B. tax advantages not available to the individual investor.
                                                   C. diversification and professional management.
                                                   D. lower expenses than “do-it-yourself” investing.
                                             2.   A REIT can avoid being taxed as a corporation by
                                                   A. receiving 75% or more of its income from real estate and distributing 90% or
                                                       more of its net investment income to its investors.
                                                   B. receiving 100% of its income from real estate and distributing 90% or more of
                                                       its net investment income to its investors.
                                                   C. receiving less than 75% of its income from real estate and distributing 100% of

                  costs than an individual investor, the other
                  expenses, especially the management fee, can
                  make investing in mutual funds more expensive
                  than selecting securities on your own.

             INTRODUCTION
                                   This unit discusses both securities and nonsecurities derivatives. The term derivative is used to
                                   describe investment vehicles that derive their value from an underlying asset, whether that asset
                                   be a security, such as a stock, or a physical commodity, such as wheat.


             LESSON 4.1: WHAT ARE DERIVATIVES?
                                   LO 4.a Recognize the common characteristics of all derivatives.

                                   Options are derivative securities. That means they derive their value from an underlying
                                   instrument, such as a stock, stock index, interest rate, or foreign currency. Option contracts
                                   offer investors a means to hedge, or protect, an investment’s value or speculate on the price
                                   movement of individual securities, markets, foreign currencies, and other instruments.

                                       An option is a contract that establishes a price and time frame for the purchase or sale of a
                                       particular underlying instrument. Two parties are involved in the contract: one party receives
                                       the right to exercise the contract to buy or sell the underlying asset; the other is obligated to
                                       fulfill the terms of the contract.

                                       In theory, options can be created on any item with a fluctuating market value. The most
                                       familiar options are those issued on common stocks; they are called equity options.

                                       The exam is going to deal solely with standardized options traded on an exchange, such as
                                       the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), or Nasdaq. These options are issued and
                                       guaranteed by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC). They are called standardized
                                       options because each option contract has three standardized terms:
                                        The underlying asset—That is, all options on XYZ stock are for 100 shares of the XYZ
                                          common stock
                                        The expiration date—All options that expire in June (or July or whatever month) have the
                                          same date and time of expiry
                                        The exercise or strike price—Strike prices are set at standardized intervals
                                       It is this standardization that makes secondary trading in options possible.

                                                          contract is for 100 shares. Therefore, the exercise of 10 calls (or puts, for that matter)
                                                          will involve 10 × 100 or 1,000 shares.

                                       Later in this unit, we will discuss nonsecurities derivatives—forwards and futures contracts.
                                       These derive their value from an asset that is not a security, most commonly a commodity.
                                       The concept is the same: there are two parties (a buyer and a seller), and they can be used by
                                       speculators or those who wish to protect (hedge) their investment.

                                       The two most important factors influencing the price of a derivative are the price movement
                                       of the underlying asset and the length of time until the contract expires (the longer the time,
                                       the greater the time value).

                                                     KNOWLEDGE CHECK 4.1
                                                     1.   The value of a derivative is based on
                                                           A. the value of the underlying asset.
                                                           B. the value set by the CBOE.
                                                           C. the face amount of the derivative.
                                                           D. the time until the underlying asset expires.
                                                     2.   All of the following are standardized for equity options except
                                                           A. the size of the contract.
                                                           B. the expiration date.
                                                           C. the maximum profit.
                                                           D. the exercise or strike price.

             LESSON 4.2: EQUITY DERIVATIVES

                                   LO 4.b Identify the difference between a put option and a call option
                                   and their strategies.


                                   Calls and Puts
                                   There are two types of option contracts: calls and puts.
                                    A call option gives its holder the right to buy a stock for a specific price within a specified
                                      time frame. A call buyer buys the right to buy a specific stock, and a call seller takes on the
                                      obligation to sell the stock.
                                    A put option gives its holder the right to sell a stock for a specific price within a specified
                                      time frame. A put buyer buys the right to sell a specific stock, and a put seller takes on the
                                      obligation to buy the stock.

                                   Each stock option contract covers 100 shares (a round lot) of stock. An option’s cost is its
                                   premium. Premiums are quoted in dollars per share. Because a contract covers 100 shares, a
                                   premium of $3 means $3 for each share times 100 shares, which equals $300.

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  Which of the following statements regarding derivative securities is not true?
                                                   A. Derivatives can be sold on securities and nonsecurities.
                                                   B. An option contract is a derivative security because it has no value independent
                                                       of the value of an underlying security.
                                                   C. An option contract’s price fluctuates in relationship to the time remaining to
                                                       expiration as well as with the price movement of the underlying security.
                                                   D. An owner of a put has the obligation to purchase securities at a designated
                                                       price (the strike price) before a specified date (the expiration date).
                                                  Answer: D. Although equity options are the most common derivative on the exam,
                                                  derivatives can be sold on any asset. For example, there are options on foreign
                                                  currency and commodity futures where the underlying asset is not a security. For this
                                                  question, an owner of a put has the right, not the obligation, to sell, not purchase, a
                                                  security at a designated price (the strike price) before a specified date (the expiration
                                                  date). That makes choice D the untrue statement. It is only the seller of an option             Unit 4
                                                  who has an obligation.

                                   Here is another way that question might be asked:

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  A customer has the right to sell 100 shares of MNO at 60 any time between July and
                                                  October. Which term best describes this situation?
                                                   A. Long call
                                                   B. Long put
                                                   C. Short call
                                                   D. Short put
                                                  Answer: B. The put buyer (long position) has the right to sell stock to a put writer
                                                  who is obligated to buy that stock.

          88         Unit 4   Types and Characteristics of Derivative Securities



                                       Option Transactions
                                       Because two types of options (calls and puts) and two types of transactions (buying and
                                       selling) exist, four basic transactions are available to an option investor:
                                        Buy calls
                                        Sell calls
                                        Buy puts
                                        Sell puts
                                       Option buyers are long the positions; option sellers are short the positions.

                                       An option conveys rights and obligations for a limited time. Therefore, each transaction has
                                       a beginning and an end—an open and a close. For instance, an option position opened by
                                       an investor buying a call is closed when the call is exercised, is sold, or expires. An option
                                       position opened by an investor selling a call is closed when the call is exercised, is bought, or
                                       expires.

                                       The owner (long position) of a put or call option contract has three ways to close a position:
                                        sell the option contract before the expiration date;
                                        exercise the option to buy or sell the security specified in the contract; or
                                        let the option expire.
                                       The simplest and most common way to close an option position is entering the transaction
                                       opposite of the opening transaction. The following table summarizes potential opening and
                                       closing positions.

                                           To Open         To Close
                                            Buy call        Sell call
                                            Sell call       Buy call
                                            Buy put         Sell put
                                            Sell put        Buy put



                                       Exercising an Option
                                       In some cases, the holder of the option (only owners can exercise—it is one of their “rights”)
                                       will decide to exercise the option. Exercising a call means purchasing the underlying stock
                                       at the strike price; exercising a put means selling the underlying stock at the strike price. For
                                       example, if you were long an ABC 50 call and the current market price of ABC is 60, you
                                       would be able to exercise and purchase stock worth $60 per share at the exercise price of $50.
                                       Or, if you were long an XYZ $45 put and the current market price of XYZ is $35, you might
                                       wish to purchase 100 shares of XYZ at $35 per share and then exercise your option to “put”
                                       the stock at $45. The test may ask you the difference between American- and European-style
                                       exercises. American style means the option can be exercised at any time the holder wishes, up
                                       to the expiration date. European-style options may only be exercised on the last trading day
                                       before the expiration date.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              A tool for remembering the difference between American and European exercises is to
                                              look at the first letter.
                                              A for American means Anytime

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              Now that you have become so focused on the exercise date differences between
                                              American and European styles, be prepared for a question stem like ”A European
                                              option is a derivative because,” and the first answer choice will probably be “it can
                                              only be exercised on the expiration date.” Although that is true about exercise, it has
                                              nothing to do with why options are derivatives. Please select an answer choice similar
                                              to “its value is based on some underlying asset.”


                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              Perhaps you noticed an inconsistency. First, we told you that European style means
                                              the option can only be exercised on the day prior to its expiration date. Then, we told
                                              you it is only exercised on its expiration date. In the industry, there seems to be much
                                              confusion about this, and for exam purposes, either statement is correct (and you
                                              won’t have to choose between them).


                                   Length of an Option Contract
                                   Options are available that are issued with an expiration date of as short as one week to as long
                                   as three years. The short-term ones are called weeklys, and the long-term ones are known as
                                   LEAPS (Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities). Most standard options are issued with an
                                   expiration length of a maximum of nine months.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              You must remember that all options, regardless of their length, are derivative
                                              securities.

                                   Many of our students tell us that when it comes to understanding options, “it is all Greek to
                                   me.” Maybe that is why options strategists use a number of Greek letters to describe various
                                   properties of an option. There are four commonly used Greeks: Delta, Gamma, Theta, and
                                   Vega. It is highly unlikely that you will have to know anything about them, but we’ve given a
                                   short definition of each in the glossary.


                                   Options Strategies
                                   Options strategies are either bullish or bearish positions on the underlying stock. Bulls
                                   believe the price of a security will go up, and bears believe the price of a security will go down.
                                   The primary reasons for buying or selling options are to profit from or hedge (protect) against
                                   price movement in the underlying security.

                                       A bullish investor may buy calls seeking profit if the price of the underlying stock rises.
                                       A bearish investor buys puts seeking profit if the price of the underlying stock declines.
                                       Likewise, a bullish investor may write (sell) puts, which will make money if the stock price is
                                       stable or rises; and a bearish investor may write (sell) calls, which will make money if the stock
                                       price is stable or declines.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     A phrase that is invaluable for figuring out options questions is “call up and put down.”
                                                     That is, you would buy a call because you are hoping (or are afraid) the price of the
                                                     stock will go up, and you would buy a put because you are hoping (or are afraid) the
                                                     price of the stock will go down.


                                       Buying Calls
                                       Investors expecting a stock to increase in value speculate on that price increase by buying calls
                                       on the stock.

                                       By buying a call, an investor can profit from the increase in the stock’s price while investing
                                       a relatively small amount of money. The most a call buyer can lose is the money paid for the
                                       option. The most a call buyer can gain is unlimited because there is no limit to how high
                                       the stock price can go. Owners of options (puts or calls) do not receive dividends on the
                                       underlying stock.

                                       As we will show you in Unit 21, buying calls is also a hedging (protection) strategy when the
                                       investor is afraid the stock price will rise.

                                                     TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                     Remember those employee stock options we discussed in Unit 1? No, they are not
                                                     at all like these puts and calls, but the employer (the company issuing the stock)
                                                     might want to use call options to protect against market risk. You see, when granting
                                                     employees the option (the right) to buy shares at a set price, the company is obligated
                                                     to deliver the shares at that agreed-upon price. What happens if the company’s stock
                                                     price soars, the employees exercise their options, and the company has to go out into
                                                     the stock markets and buy stock at a price far in excess of what they’re going to be
                                                     selling it for? That hurts. One way to protect the company is to buy call options on the
                                                     stock so that if this were to happen, they could use their options to buy the stock at
                                                     whatever exercise price was part of the contract.

                                   Writing Calls
                                   A neutral or bearish investor can write (sell) a call and collect the premium. An investor who
                                   believes a stock’s price will stay the same or decline can write a call and can:
                                    generate income from the option premium; and
                                    partially protect (hedge) a long stock position by offsetting any loss on the sale of the
                                      stock by the premium amount; or receive an exercise notice if the stock price increases.

                                   A call option will generally be exercised anytime the underlying stock’s price is above the
                                   strike price at expiration date. In addition to the premium received when the option was sold,
                                   the writer will be paid the strike price for the stock. If the option writer owns the stock on
                                   which the call is being written, it is known as a covered call and the risk is limited because no
                                   matter how high the stock price rises (meaning the call will certainly be exercised), the writer
                                   merely uses the stock already owned (which has been deposited with the broker-dealer) to
                                   make delivery. However, if the writer does not own the stock, the option is uncovered (usually
                                   referred to as naked in the industry). That’s when the risk is unlimited, because the writer
                                   must pay the going market price (and there is theoretically no limit as to how high a stock’s
                                   price can go) to acquire the stock needed to fulfill the obligation to deliver. That is why naked
                                   call writing is the most risky options strategy.


                                   Buying Puts
                                   A bearish investor—one who believes a stock will decline in price—can speculate on
                                   the price decline by buying puts. A put buyer acquires the right to sell 100 shares of the
                                   underlying stock at the strike price before the expiration date.

                                             EXAMPLE
                                             Here is how that might work. An investor following ABCD common stock believes that
                                             it is grossly overpriced at $75 per share and when the next earnings report is released,
                                             the stock will drop at least 10 points. If the investor were to purchase an ABCD 75 put
                                             for a premium of $3 and was correct, once the stock was at $65 (the 10-point drop),
                                             a purchase could be made at that price for $65 per share and then the put could be
                                             exercised at the $75 per share strike price. This would give the investor a profit of $7
                                             per share (the $10 difference between the cost of $65 and the sale at $75, minus the
                                             $3 premium paid). A $700 profit on a $300 investment is a very handsome percentage
                                             return on investment.                                                                               Unit 4

                                   As we will show you in Unit 21, buying puts is also a hedging (protection) strategy when the
                                   investor is afraid the stock price will fall.


                                   Writing Puts
                                   Generally, investors who write puts believe that the stock’s price will rise or remain stable.
                                   A put writer (seller) is obligated to buy stock at the exercise price if the put buyer puts it to
                                   the put writer. If a stock’s price is above the put strike price at expiration, the put expires
                                   unexercised, allowing the put writer to keep the premium. Just as with writing calls, receiving
                                   that premium is a source of income. Put writers will lose if the stock price falls (the buyer
                                   “wins”), but the loss is limited because the stock price can never fall below zero.

                                       Straddles
                                       When an investor is not sure which direction the market will move but has a strong opinion
                                       that there will be dynamic movement, a strategy that might be employed is the purchase of
                                       a straddle. This is the combining of a put and a call on the same stock with the same exercise
                                       price and expiration date. If the stock moves up, a profit is made on the call; if it moves down,
                                       a profit is made on the put.

                                                     TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                     Those who buy a straddle will profit from volatility, while those who sell a straddle will
                                                     profit if the market is stable because the options will expire unexercised.



                                       LO 4.c Contrast calls, rights, and warrants.

                                       Although generally treated as equity securities, in truth, rights and warrants are derivatives
                                       because their value is derived from the common stock, which they may acquire by exercising
                                       that right or warrant. Because rights and warrants give the holder the option (but not the
                                       obligation) to buy a stock at a specific price during a specific time period, they can be
                                       compared in most respects to a call option. There are some differences, however. Let’s start
                                       with rights.


                                       Rights
                                       A stock right, sometimes referred to as a preemptive right, is a privilege extended to existing
                                       holders of a company’s common stock. When the company is going to issue additional shares
                                       of common stock, in order to prevent dilution of ownership by the current owners, they are
                                       given the right to preempt (come ahead of ) any members of the general public and have the
                                       first shot at the new stock. The right permits them to purchase enough shares to keep their
                                       proportionate interest in the company. Here is a very simple example:

                                       Steve has 100 shares of DEF Corporation common stock. DEF has 10,000 shares of stock
                                       outstanding, so it is clear that Steve owns 1% of the company (100/10,000) = .01). DEF
                                       wishes to raise additional capital by issuing 5,000 new shares of stock. Steve will receive rights
                                       to purchase how many of those 5,000 shares?

                                       In order to keep his 1% ownership, Steve will receive stock rights to purchase 50 shares of
                                       the new issue. As an incentive, rights offerings always have an exercise price slightly below
                                       the current market price of the existing stock. Also, because the company needs to raise the
                                       money, they limit the time in which you have to decide to exercise your right, usually no more
                                       than 45–60 days. If Steve decided he did not want to exercise his rights, he could sell them,
                                       and because the exercise price is below the market price, they would have a value.

                                       The key points to remember about rights are:
                                        They are given (not sold) to existing holders of the common stock.
                                        They are exercisable at a price below the current market.
                                        They have a short lifespan—they will expire in no more than 45–60 days, sometimes less.
                                        They can be sold and then the buyer can exercise them.
                                        Although generally unwise to do, they can be left to expire.

                                   Warrants
                                   Unlike rights, warrants have an exercise price above the current market price, and, unlike
                                   rights, they have no relationship to an existing stockholder’s proportionate interest. Another
                                   difference is that warrants have a long expiration period, sometimes as much as 10 years.
                                   They are usually attached to a bond issue (their attractiveness sweetens the issue, frequently
                                   allowing for a lower interest rate on the bond) or are attached to a new stock offering where
                                   the package is considered a unit, such as 1 share of stock with a warrant to purchase another
                                   share. In most cases, warrants can be detached and sold separately.

                                   The key points to remember about warrants are:
                                    They are exercisable at a price above the current market. Why would anyone be interested
                                      in that? Because you might have a five-year expiration period and have the right to buy
                                      the stock at $45 when it is selling at $40 today. If you think there is a chance that the
                                      stock’s price will move more than 5 points in five years, you can make money—sometimes
                                      lots of money because of the leverage.
                                    Their “life” is considerably longer than rights and longer than call options as well.
                                    When detached, they can be traded like any other security (they are usually traded on the
                                      same exchange as the company’s common stock).
                                    Most securities professionals view warrants as call options with a very long time to
                                      expiration.
                                    Warrants do not have voting rights, nor do they receive dividends—the same as any other
                                      derivative.

                                   One major difference between call options and rights/warrants is that options originate on
                                   the exchange on which they are traded, whereas rights and warrants originate with the issuer
                                   of the stock. The effect of this is that new shares are issued when a warrant is exercised, while
                                   exercise of a call option requires the assigned seller to deliver existing shares.

                                             PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  GEMCO Manufacturing Company, traded on the NYSE, has announced that it will be
                                                  issuing 10 million new shares of common stock to raise new capital for the purchase
                                                  of new equipment. Your client, owning 1,000 shares of GEMCO common stock, would
                                                  probably receive
                                                    A. an advance invitation to purchase some of the new shares.
                                                    B. options to purchase some of the new shares.                                                Unit 4
                                                    C. preemptive rights to purchase some of the new shares.
                                                    D. warrants to purchase some of the new shares.
                                                  Answer: C. Commonly, when a publicly traded company issues new shares of
                                                  common stock, existing shareholders receive rights, sometimes called stock rights,
                                                  enabling them to purchase shares in proportion to their current ownership, usually
                                                  at a reduced price. These rights rarely last longer than 45 days and must be exercised
                                                  or sold within that time or they’ll just expire worthless. Warrants are not sent to
                                                  shareholders; they are either purchased in the open market or come attached to a
                                                  new issue of securities as a “sweetener.”

                                                           A. One call option is an option to buy 100 shares of a particular common stock at
                                                               a specified price.
                                                           B. A put option permits investors to speculate on a rise in the price of an

                                                               allows investors to speculate on a decline in the stock price without short
                                                               selling the common stock any time prior to a specified expiration date.
                                                           C. One put option gives the buyer the right to sell 100 shares of a particular

                                                           D. Options may be used as a hedge against a portfolio position by establishing an
                                                               opposite position in the option contracts.
                                                     2.   All of the following statements describe preemptive rights except
                                                           A. they are most commonly offered with debentures to make the offering more

                                                           B. they are short-term instruments that become worthless after the expiration date.
                                                           C. they are issued by a corporation.
                                                           D. they are traded in the secondary market.



          LESSON 4.3: FUTURES AND FORWARDS

                                       LO 4.d Describe the difference between futures and forward
                                       contracts.


                                       Forward Contracts
                                       Forward contracts were developed as a means for commodity users and producers to arrange
                                       for the exchange of the commodity at a time agreeable to both. Used in Europe as early as the
                                       Middle Ages, typically for agricultural items (grains and so forth), forward contracts evolved
                                       to eliminate the problem of finding a buyer or seller for an upcoming cash market transaction.
                                       They also reduce the price risk inherent in changing supply and demand relationships. How
                                       so? Because the seller knows exactly how much he will receive for his product. Of course, he
                                       may wind up contracting to sell too cheaply if market prices at delivery are much higher, but
                                       he is protected against receiving too little if the “harvest” is plentiful and prices plunge.

                                       A forward contract is a direct commitment between one buyer and one seller. If the position
                                       is held until the closing date, the forward seller is obligated to make delivery; the forward
                                       buyer is obligated to take delivery. A forward contract is nonstandardized. Its unique terms
                                       are defined solely by the contract parties without third-party intervention. This arrangement
                                       ensures a ready market or supply source because it presumes delivery.

                                       Because forward contracts are direct obligations between a specific buyer and seller (the
                                       user and producer), they are not easily transferred and are considered illiquid (there is
                                       no secondary market for forward contracts). Further, each party risks the credit and
                                       trustworthiness of the other. This is known as counterparty risk.

                                       The five components of a typical forward contract are:
                                        quantity of the commodity;
                                        quality of the commodity;




04_0-2532_LEM_65E_Unit04.indd 94                                                                                                                 28/10/22 12:41 PM
                                                                             Unit 4   Types and Characteristics of Derivative Securities   95


                                    time of delivery;
                                    place for delivery; and
                                    price to be paid at delivery.


                                   Futures
                                   In contrast to forward contracts, futures contracts are exchange-traded obligations. The buyer
                                   or seller is contingently responsible for the full value of the contract. That is, unlike with
                                   forwards, obligations are created only when the contract is exercised. A buyer goes long, or
                                   establishes a long position, and if the decision is made to exercise, is obligated to take delivery
                                   of the commodity on the future date specified. A seller goes short, or establishes a short
                                   position, and if an exercise notice is tendered, is obligated to deliver the commodity on the
                                   specified future date. If the seller does not own the commodity, his potential loss is unlimited
                                   because he has promised delivery and must pay any price to acquire the commodity to deliver.
                                   This is the same concept as writing an uncovered call.

                                   As prices change, gains or losses are computed daily for all open futures positions on the basis
                                   of each day’s settlement price. Gains are credited and losses are debited for each open position,
                                   long or short. All accounts for firms and traders must be settled before the opening of trading
                                   on the next trading day.

                                   Buyers and sellers benefit from organizations that act as clearinghouses for the contracts.
                                   Clearinghouses enable futures positions to be offset easily prior to delivery. To offset, close, or
                                   liquidate a futures position before delivery, an investor must complete a transaction opposite
                                   to the trade that initiated (opened) the futures position. The offsetting transaction must occur
                                   in the same commodity, for the same delivery month, and on the same exchange. About 98%
                                   of futures contracts are offset before delivery. Futures may be highly leveraged.

                                   If, at expiration, the settlement price is higher than the delivery price, a long position results
                                   in a profit while a short position loses. Conversely, if the settlement price is lower than the
                                   delivery price, shorts profit and longs lose.
                                   Typically, there are five standardized parts to an exchange-traded futures contract:
                                    Quantity of the commodity (e.g., 5,000 bushels of corn or 100 ounces of gold)
                                    Quality of the commodity (specific grade or range of grades may be acceptable for
                                                                                                                                                  Unit 4
                                      delivery, including price adjustments for different deliverable grades)
                                    Delivery price (similar to exercise or strike price with options)
                                    Time for delivery (e.g., December wheat to be delivered)
                                    Location (approved for delivery)

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              Futures are most commonly used by speculators, while forwards are used by
                                              producers. That explains why such a small percentage of futures contracts ever end
                                              with delivery.

                                                     PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                          Forwards are commonly used by producers (farmers) to hedge the risk of the price
                                                          of the commodity falling before it is able to be harvested and sold. For example, if a
                                                          farmer has planted soybeans and wishes to hedge against a possible decline in the
                                                          spot or cash price at delivery, the farmer could
                                                            A. buy forward contracts in a size equal to the amount of the soybeans expected
                                                                to be harvested.
                                                            B. buy futures contracts in a size equal to the amount of the soybeans expected
                                                                to be harvested.
                                                            C. sell forward or futures contracts in a size equal to the amount of the soybeans
                                                                expected to be harvested.
                                                            D. sell the soybeans for cash today.
                                                          Answer: C. Hedging a commodity yet to be harvested is done by selling a forward
                                                          or a futures contract on that commodity. Invariably, producers will use forward
                                                          contracts but could also use a futures contract. In that way, the price is guaranteed in
                                                          the event of a market decline. However, the producer is giving up any potential gain
                                                          in the event the prices rise above the futures/forward agreed-upon one.


                                         Regulation of Futures and Forwards
                                         Because these are not securities, futures and forwards do not come under the jurisdiction of
                                         the SEC. The self-regulatory organization (SRO) that is in charge of regulating these markets
                                         and their participants is the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

                                                     As is the case, a clearing firm is the counterparty and guarantor of exchange-traded
                                                     activity, acting as the buyer to all sellers and seller to all buyers. This eliminates
                                                     counterparty risk when investing in futures contracts.

                                             1.   An investor takes a long position in a commodity forward contract at a forward price
                                                  of $105 when the spot price (current market price) is $102. One month later, the spot
                                                  price has increased to $110. At that time, the forward price of the contract is
                                                   A. less than $105.
                                                   B. $105.
                                                   C. between $105 and $110.
                                                   D. greater than $110.
                                             2.   A commodities speculator purchases a 1,000-bushel wheat futures contract for 80
                                                  cents per bushel. At expiration, the settlement price is 70 cents per bushel. This

                                                    A. has a $100 gain.
                                                    B. has a $100 loss.
                                                    C. must make delivery of the wheat.
                                                    D. effectively hedged the long wheat position.



             LESSON 4.4: BENEFITS AND RISKS OF DERIVATIVES

                                   LO 4.e Identify the costs, benefits, and risks of derivative securities.

                                   Using derivatives can be a useful strategy for investors if the circumstances warrant it. There
                                   is no cost, per se, to open an options account, although, as we will learn in Unit 16, the
                                   account opening procedure is somewhat more involved than opening a regular account at a
                                   broker-dealer.

                                   For those who buy options (long position), the only cost is the premium to purchase the
                                   option plus whatever the brokerage firm charges in commissions. With a very limited, and
                                   probably not tested, exception, options cannot be purchased on margin (covered in Unit 23)
                                   so, without any borrowed money, there is no interest charged.
                                   Selling options (short position) brings in money from the sale, and the seller receives all of
                                   that premium, less the brokerage charges. If the call or put being written (sold) is uncovered,
                                   there is a margin requirement, but that is beyond the scope of the exam.

                                   The costs to carry forwards and futures are much more complicated, and we are not aware of
                                   the topic ever being tested.                                                                                   Unit 4

                                   As with any investment, there are benefits and there are risks. We’ll look at those most likely
                                   to be on your exam.


                                   Leverage
                                   One of the key benefits to using derivatives is that of leveraging your investment. Because an
                                   option’s cost is normally much less than the underlying stock’s cost, option contracts provide
                                   investors with leverage: relatively little money allows an investor to control an investment that
                                   would otherwise require a much larger capital outlay. And, if you purchase a call and “guess
                                   right,” the potential profit is unlimited (theoretically, there is no limit as to how high the
                                   stock’s price can go).

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     An investor can buy the common stock of RST Corporation for $58 per share, investing
                                                     $5,800, or buy an RST 55 call for $6, an investment of $600. If RST’s price increases to
                                                     $70, the stock investor will see a 20.7% profit ($12 profit ÷ $58 investment), whereas
                                                     the option investor, with the call worth a minimum of $15 ($70 – $55), will have more
                                                     than doubled the investment ($9 profit ÷ $6 investment = 150%). The opposite is also
                                                     true; if RST trades below $55, say at $48, when the option expires, the stock investor
                                                     has a modest loss, but the option investor loses the entire investment. (What is the
                                                     value of an option to buy stock at $55 per share when it is currently available to
                                                     anyone at $48? Nothing.)

                                       As you can see from the example, leverage works both ways—great when the stock is going
                                       your way, and a possible loss of everything when it doesn’t. Of course, if, in the example
                                       below, RST had gone bankrupt, leaving the stock worthless, the investor holding 100 shares
                                       would have lost the entire $5,800, while the option investor’s loss would have been limited to
                                       the $600 premium paid.


                                       Less Risk
                                       When used properly, options can actually lower an investor’s risk. The classic example is the
                                       covered call where the investor owns the stock and then writes a call option on it. Realize that
                                       there are only three things that can happen after you purchase a stock:

                                       1. The stock can increase in price;
                                       2. The stock can remain stable; or
                                       3. The stock can decline in price.

                                       If you think about it, two of those possibilities are unfavorable. Certainly, you don’t want the
                                       stock to fall in price. Even if the stock remains level, you’ve suffered from opportunity cost
                                       (you could have put it in the bank with no market risk and earned interest). Only if the stock
                                       increases by more than the risk-free rate do you emerge a winner.

                                       However, if you write a call on that stock, you wind up better for sure in cases 2 and 3 and
                                       perhaps even in case 1. Let’s look at an example:

                                       Meredith purchases 100 shares of ABC at $50 per share. She then writes (sells) an ABC 50
                                       call for a premium of 4 ($400). If the stock goes down to $47 by expiration date, the option
                                       she wrote will expire (who is going to call on her to sell stock at $50 when it is available for
                                       $47 in the marketplace?). In reality, though, she hasn’t lost $300 because she received $400
                                       when she sold the option—she is still $100 ahead of the game, even though the stock dropped
                                       in price. It isn’t until the stock falls below $46 that she begins to lose money, but, no matter
                                       how far it falls, she will still be $400 ahead of having just bought the stock without selling
                                       the option. If the stock price remains the same, the option will expire and she will still own
                                       the shares, but she will have $400 in her account from the sale of the option. Only in the first
                                       choice is it possible for her to be a “loser,” but even that wouldn’t happen until the stock rose
                                       above $54 per share. How is that? If the stock is $53, yes, her option will be exercised, and she
                                       will have to sell her stock at the strike price of $50. She paid $50 for it but also received the
                                       $4 premium, so the total received on the sale of the stock plus the option is $54. Now, if the
                                       stock goes to $60, she would have been better off never writing the option. That is a risk you

                                   Alternative to Selling Short
                                   As we will learn in Unit 23, one way to make money when an investor is of the belief that
                                   a stock’s price will decline is to sell that stock short. At this juncture, to keep things simple,
                                   selling stock short involves putting up a deposit in a margin account and borrowing stock to
                                   sell, and carries with it the possibility of an unlimited loss. When you buy a put, you benefit
                                   when the stock’s price declines, but all you pay is the premium and, if you guess wrong, that is
                                   all you can lose.

                                   Having just mentioned the possibility of an unlimited loss when an investor sells a stock
                                   short, we would be remiss if we didn’t discuss the parallel situation with options. When an
                                   investor writes an uncovered (naked) call option, the potential loss is unlimited. Here is how
                                   that works:

                                   With the market price of ABC at $50 per share, Manny writes a 50 call option for a premium
                                   of 3. Manny does not own any ABC but, as the seller of the call option, is obligated to deliver
                                   100 shares of the ABC stock and receive $5,000 if the option is exercised. We use the phrase
                                   “call-up” to help us remember our objective when we buy a call. If the price of ABC should go
                                   up, the option will be exercised, and Manny will have to buy it at its current market price and
                                   then deliver it. The question is, how high can it go? Theoretically (and that’s the exam view),
                                   there is no limit—it can rise to infinity. That leaves Manny having to pay an infinite amount
                                   to buy stock for which he receives only the $5,000 strike price plus the $300 premium. Just in
                                   case you want to say, “But, because he receives $5,300, his loss can’t be unlimited,” remember,
                                   infinity minus any other number is still infinity. We know this is just theoretical, but if you’ve
                                   watched some of the better-known companies over the past few years, some of the price
                                   increases have been astronomical.


                                   Hedging
                                   In the example of writing the covered call, we showed one example of hedging (protecting)
                                   a position. In that case, the first 4 points of a market decline were absorbed by the premium
                                   received from the sale of the call. There is more to discuss on using options to hedge, and
                                   we’re going to cover that in Unit 21.


                                   Time Decay
                                                                                                                                                 Unit 4
                                   Have you ever heard an investor say, “I’m going to hold this stock until it gets back to what
                                   I paid for it”? We’re not going to debate the logic of that statement other than to say, that
                                   doesn’t work with options. They ultimately expire and, if the stock hasn’t moved in the
                                   direction you’re hoping for, you will run out of time. Time decay is the concept that as the
                                   time to expiration gets closer, the value of the option decreases.


                                   Taxation
                                   In most cases, any profits realized from buying or selling options is considered a short-term
                                   capital gain. As we will learn in Unit 15, short-term gains are taxed as ordinary income, a
                                   much higher rate than long-term gains.

                                   Much of what we’ve shown you here applies to forwards and futures as well, but other than
                                   some very basic questions, we don’t expect the kind of detail we’ve presented here for options.

                                                     PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                          Here is the type of question that is basically easy, but, if you don’t read
                                                          carefully, you will waste time trying to figure it out.
                                                          Among the purposes of purchasing derivatives would be all of the following except
                                                           A. hedging.
                                                           B. income.
                                                           C. profits.
                                                           D. speculation.
                                                          Answer: B. Purchase of a derivative, whether an option, a forward, or a futures
                                                          contract, never generates income. Selling one does, but the question refers to a
                                                          purchaser, and that is why the correct answer is choice B.

             INTRODUCTION
                                    In the 1990s financial advisers began introducing their wealthy clients to alternative
                                    investments, now generally referred to as alts. These included, among other products, ETNs,
                                    leveraged ETFs, and new, highly sophisticated financial derivatives. One thing that all of these
                                    had in common was that they were complex and not easy to understand for either the investor
                                    or the person recommending the investment.

                                    Although investing can be complex, standard investments are fairly easy to comprehend. Even
                                    new investors understand that stocks have more risk but hold out the chance of superior returns,
                                    while bonds generally have less risk with correspondingly lower returns. All investors dream of
                                    scoring a touchdown and not getting tackled for a loss. Alternative investments try to do just
                                    that. Some are successful, but many are not. Suitability determinations need to be made on a
                                    case-by-case basis, considering each customer’s objectives, circumstances, and sophistication.

                                       Securities professionals must take special care in recommending these complex products to the
                                       sophisticated customer and even more so to one with less financial acumen.

                                       In addition to alternative investments, the exam will test your knowledge on other, more
                                       traditional assets, such as investment real estate and commodities, including precious metals.


          LESSON 5.1: DIRECT PARTICIPATION PROGRAMS (DPPS)
                                       LO 5.a Identify the concept of flow-through of passive income and
                                       loss as it applies to DPPs.

                                       Direct participation programs (DPPs) are one class of alternative investment. DPPs,
                                       many of which are limited partnerships, allow the economic consequences of a business to
                                       flow-through to investors. Any income or loss to the investor is considered passive because
                                       the investor does not take an active role in the management of the business; that is the role of
                                       the general partner, as you will learn shortly. Unlike corporations, limited partnerships pay no
                                       dividends. Rather, they pass income, gains, losses, deductions, and credits directly to investors.
                                       Limited partnerships offer investors limited liability. Similar to a stockholder in a corporation,
                                       creditors cannot generally come directly to limited partners to collect on defaulted debt. In
                                       general, the maximum potential loss to a limited partner is the amount already invested plus
                                       any funds committed for which have not yet been submitted.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    In Unit 15, the topic of partnership taxation will be covered in greater detail, but at
                                                    this point, we want you to know that any income received by a partner is considered
                                                    passive, and the same is true for losses. The effect of this is that any passive losses can
                                                    only be deducted as losses against passive income.


                                       LO 5.b Differentiate between the roles of the general partner(s) and
                                       the limited partner(s) in a DPP.


                                       Investors in a Limited Partnership
                                       It is important to understand that a direct participation program (DPP) is just a different
                                       way to invest in a business rather than buying the company’s stock. There are certain tax
                                       advantages to being structured as a partnership with the flow-through of income or loss being
                                       one of them. That aside, this is merely an investment in a business, whether it be a RELP (real
                                       estate limited partnership), an oil and gas drilling program, or a movie production company.

                                       Just like any other business, there are those who run the enterprise (management) and those
                                       who contribute the capital (investors). For DPPs, those roles are assumed by the general
                                       partner(s), usually referred to as GPs, and the limited partner(s), the LPs. From a legal
                                       standpoint, there must be at least one GP and one LP.

                                       Investing in a DPP requires analyzing the program just as one would analyze a stock or bond
                                       investment, just with a few different parameters.

                                                                                     Unit 5   Alternative Investments and Other Assets   105


                                    An investor should choose to invest in a specific limited partnership because:
                                     it is economically viable;
                                     the investor can make use of the potential tax benefits;
                                     the GP(s) has (have) demonstrated management ability and expertise in running similar
                                       programs;
                                     the program’s objectives match the investor’s objectives and do so within a time frame that
                                       meets the investor’s needs; and
                                     the start-up costs and projected revenues are in line with the start-up costs and revenues
                                       of similar ventures.

                                    Promoters structure DPPs to meet various objectives. When a promoter’s tax stance is too
                                    aggressive or is without economic purpose in the view of the IRS, the program is considered
                                    an abusive tax shelter. If the IRS judges the program to be abusive, it disallows deductions;
                                    assesses back taxes, interest, and penalties; and, in some cases, charges the promoter with
                                    criminal intent to defraud.

                                    Investors should try to match their current and future objectives with a program’s stated
                                    objectives.

                                               EXAMPLE
                                               A person seeking current taxable passive income should not invest in an oil and gas
                                               exploratory drilling program. Why not? Because these programs drill where oil (or gas)
                                               has never been found before (exploratory) and have a low success rate. Even when
                                               they do “hit,” it may take years before any income is generated.

                                               TAKE NOTE
                                               Because the majority of these are privately placed, DPPs are considered illiquid,
                                               and investors must commit money for a long period of time. Even those that are
                                               publicly traded do not have the liquidity of other investments, frequently requiring
                                               authorization from the GP in order to be able to sell your unit(s).


                                    General Partner (GP)
                                    The GPs are the active investors in a limited partnership and assume responsibility for all
                                    aspects of the partnership’s operations. A general partner:
                                     makes decisions that bind the partnership;
                                     buys and sells property for the partnership;
                                     manages the partnership property and money;
                                     supervises all aspects of the partnership’s business; and
                                     maintains a minimum 1% financial interest in the partnership.
                                    Unlike limited partners, who have limited liability, general partners assume unlimited liability
                                    and are therefore personally liable for all partnership business losses and debts. A partnership’s
                                    creditors may seek repayment from the GPs and may go after their personal assets.                           Unit 5

                                    A general partner has a fiduciary relationship to the LPs in that the GP has been entrusted
                                    with the LPs’ capital and is legally bound to use that capital in the investors’ best interests. The

                                       GP must manage the business in the partnership’s best interest and avoid the appearance of
                                       improper use of assets and conflicts of interest. The GP cannot borrow from the partnership,
                                       compete with the partnership, or commingle personal funds with partnership funds. Finally,
                                       GPs do not generally receive any distributions from profits until after a payment has been
                                       made to the LPs.


                                       Limited Partner (LP)
                                       LPs are passive investors with no management or day-to-day decision-making responsibilities;
                                       therefore, they usually are not held personally responsible for the partnership’s indebtedness.
                                       In fact, if an LP does take an active role, she faces the danger of losing the limitation on
                                       liability. LPs may receive cash distributions and capital gains from partnerships. The total
                                       yield of a partnership investment takes into account all potential rewards: tax deductions, cash
                                       distributions, and capital gains. Units of ownership in a partnership are called interests, rather
                                       than shares.

                                                         In a direct participation program, liability for the debts of the business falls upon the
                                                           A. general partner(s).
                                                           B. limited partner(s).
                                                           C. shareholder(s).
                                                           D. agent(s) selling the program.
                                                         Answer: A. DPPs consist of at least one GP and one LP. The liability of the limited
                                                         partners is limited to their investment, including commitments made but not yet
                                                         fulfilled. On the other hand, the general partners bear the liability for the debts of the
                                                         entity.

                                       DPPs may be offered either as private placements, qualifying for an exemption from
                                       registration under state and federal law (as will be described in Unit 8), or publicly registered
                                       either with the SEC, the state(s), or both. In either case, specialized documentation known as
                                       a subscription agreement is required from investors.

                                       An investor who buys a limited partnership unit must complete and sign a subscription
                                       agreement, which includes a statement of the investor’s net worth and annual income and
                                       a power of attorney form appointing the GP as the agent of the partnership. The agent is
                                       responsible for making certain that the information the potential investor provides in the
                                       subscription agreement is complete and accurate.

                                                           B. the REIT passes through at least 90% of its taxable income, while the DPP
                                                               retains the income.
                                                           C. the DPP is a pass-through vehicle for both income and loss, while the REIT
                                                               does not pass through losses.
                                                           D. DPPs generally have greater liquidity than REITs.

             LESSON 5.2: ALTERNATIVE POOLED INVESTMENTS

                                    vehicles that are considered alternative investments.

                                    The category of alts also includes a number of pooled investment vehicles. Probably the best
                                    known is the hedge fund (covered in Unit 3), but there are a number of others. The following
                                    is a description of the pooled investment vehicles considered alternative investments that are
                                    most likely to appear on the exam.


                                    Exchange-Traded Notes (ETNs)
                                    Although similar in some regards, don’t confuse ETFs with ETNs. It could be said that
                                    ETNs are cousins of ETFs. That said, just as with family members, there are some important
                                    differences. Most obvious is the difference in their basic structure. While ETNs register
                                    under the Securities Act of 1933, ETFs register under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
                                    Basically, this means that ETNs are made as debt instruments, while ETFs are looked at as
                                    investment companies. ETNs are a type of exchange-traded debt security offering a return
                                    linked to a market index or other benchmark rather than periodic interest payments as is the
                                    case with traditional debt securities. These are sometimes referred to as equity-linked notes
                                    (ELNs), which is a real misnomer because they are debt securities.

                                    Issuers of ETNs issue and redeem notes as a means to keep the ETN’s price in line with a
                                    calculated value, called the indicative value or closing indicative value for ETNs. This value is
                                    calculated and published at the end of each day by the ETN issuer. When an ETN is trading
                                    at a premium above the indicative value, issuing more notes to the market can bring the price
                                    down. Similarly, if an ETN is trading at a discount, redemption of notes by the issuer reduces
                                    the number of notes available in the market, which tends to raise the price. ETN issuers have
                                    primary control over the issuance and redemption processes, which can become a conflict of
                                    interest.

                                    Unlike ETFs, they do not buy or hold the assets replicating the performance of the underlying
                                    index. Some of the indexes and investment strategies used by ETNs can be sophisticated and
                                    very complex, carrying many different risks. They should be offered only to people who are

                                                                                                                                                 Unit 5
                                    knowledgeable and comfortable with the risks. Those risks, in part, include:
                                     credit risk (ETNs are senior unsecured debt obligations);
                                     market risk;
                                     liquidity risk (although exchange traded, a trading market may not develop);

                                        call, early redemption, and acceleration risk (ETNs may be called at the issuer’s
                                          discretion); and
                                        conflicts of interest (the issuer may engage in trading activities that are at odds with note
                                          holders [shorting, for instance]).


                                       Leveraged ETFs
                                       These funds attempt to deliver a multiple of the return of the benchmark index they are
                                       designated to track. For instance, a 2× leveraged fund would try to deliver two times the
                                       return of whatever index it is tracking. With leveraged funds, there are no limits by rule or
                                       regulation as to the amount of leverage that could be applied to a portfolio. Currently there
                                       are numerous 2× and 3× leveraged funds available to investors. The risk associated with
                                       leverage is that it is always a double-edged sword; volatility is magnified. Therefore, the risk
                                       to be recognized regarding this fund strategy is that if the benchmark index is falling, then
                                       the fund’s returns will be, in theory, the designated leverage amount (perhaps 2 or 3) times
                                       the loss. In addition, most of these funds use derivative products such as options, futures, and
                                       swaps to enable them to achieve the stated goal. Because these derivative products are not
                                       suitable for all investors, so too can it be said of the leverage fund portfolio containing them.
                                       Ultimately, as always, suitability becomes an issue when recommending these products.


                                       Inverse (Short or Bear) Funds
                                       Inverse funds, sometimes referred to as bear or short funds, attempt to deliver returns that
                                       are the opposite of the benchmark index they are tracking. For example, if the benchmark
                                       is down 2%, the fund’s goal is to be up 2%. In addition, inverse funds can also be leveraged
                                       funds or, said another way, 2 or 3 times the opposite of the indices’ return. You won’t find
                                       investors looking for a bull inverse fund. That would be one where if the index goes up, the
                                       value of your investment goes down; not an attractive strategy.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    Leveraged and inverse ETFs use options and other derivatives to achieve their goals.

                                                    EXAMPLE
                                                    A simple example of this would be an inverse fund tracking the S&P 500. If the index
                                                    were to drop by 1%, the value of the inverse fund would rise by 1%. If this were a 3×
                                                    inverse fund, then the fund’s value would rise by 3%. Of course, if the index were to
                                                    rise, the performance of the inverse fund would suffer, especially if it was leveraged.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    FINRA warns investors that most leveraged and inverse ETFs “reset” daily, meaning that
                                                    they are designed to achieve their stated objectives on a daily basis. Their performance
                                                    over longer periods of time—over weeks or months or years—can differ significantly from
                                                    the performance (or inverse of the performance) of their underlying index or benchmark
                                                    during the same period of time. Therefore, in most cases, these would not be suitable
                                                    investments for buy and hold investors or those with other than a very short time horizon.
                                                    For the TVIX (Velocity Shares Daily 2× VIX ST ETN), one of the risk disclosures (page 28,
                                                    PS-28) reads like this (bold theirs, not ours):
                                                    The long-term expected value of your ETNs is zero. If you hold your ETNs as a
                                                    long-term investment, it is likely that you will lose all or a substantial portion
                                                    of your investment.

                                              Both leveraged and inverse index funds (leveraged or not) can be traded on an
                                              exchange. When they are, they are known as exchange-traded funds (ETFs). If
                                              the shares are exchange traded, they are priced by supply and demand, can be
                                              purchased on margin, and are bought and sold throughout the trading day, like
                                              all exchange-traded products. For those that are not exchange traded (e.g., inverse
                                              mutual funds), they would be priced, purchased, and redeemed like all investment
                                              company shares. Neither of these fund types carry any guarantee that they will
                                              achieve the stated goals or objectives.


                                    Structured Products
                                    When you need something that doesn’t yet exist, what do you do? You build it. That is
                                    the concept behind structured products: they are built (structured) to meet specific needs.
                                    In many cases, they involve structuring a debt issue in such a fashion as to provide lower
                                    borrowing costs to the issuer while increasing potential returns to the lender. The goal is to
                                    give investors more reasons to accept a lower interest rate on debt in exchange for certain
                                    features.

                                    In other examples, options and other derivatives are used to provide possible principal
                                    protection or other goals. Needless to say, for the most part these are highly complex products
                                    and should be limited to those investors who have the necessary financial sophistication to
                                    be able to understand the potential risks. When used properly, they can be useful tools to
                                    increase portfolio diversification.


                                    Structured Notes with Principal Protection
                                    FINRA defines the term “structured note with principal protection” as any structured
                                    product that combines a bond with a derivative component and offers a full or partial return
                                    of principal at maturity. Structured notes with principal protection typically reflect the
                                    combination of a zero-coupon bond, which pays no interest until the bond matures, with an
                                    option or other derivative product whose payoff is linked to an underlying asset, index, or
                                    benchmark. These notes are promises to pay made by the product issuers. That is why any
                                    guarantee that the principal will be protected, whether in whole or in part, is only as good as
                                    the financial strength of the company that makes that promise. For those who can remember,
                                    this is what happened to investors who purchased structured notes with principal protection
                                    issued by Lehman Brothers Holdings, which declared bankruptcy in September 2008.

          LESSON 5.3: OTHER ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS
                                       LO 5.d Compare viaticals and life settlement policies.

                                       The terms viatical and life settlement are often used interchangeably, but they are technically
                                       not quite the same. The most significant (and testable) difference is that viaticals apply to
                                       those with a terminal illness and a life expectancy of 24 months or less regardless of their
                                       age, while life settlements apply to those who, although generally at least 65 years old, are in
                                       decent health with a life expectancy of at least 2 years that can run 10 years or longer. Health
                                       and life expectancy aside, the concepts are the same for both. In general, almost any kind
                                       of life insurance policy can be sold, although most companies will not purchase a straight
                                       (nonconvertible) term life policy.

                                       Viatical settlements emerged in the early 1990s in response to the AIDS crisis to create
                                       opportunities for terminally ill patients to receive money by selling their life insurance death
                                       benefits for much more than the cash surrender value available (but less than the death
                                       benefit) from insurance companies. The idea is that the money the person gets from the
                                       settlement is to go toward paying for medical expenses during this two-year period. Interests
                                       in the settled insurance policies are then sold to investors, with the promise of returns in the
                                       form of the death benefit (an amount higher than the purchase price) to be paid upon the
                                       death of the insured. As the market has expanded, viatical settlement providers have turned to
                                       new classes of viators, those selling their life insurance policies, including the elderly and the
                                       chronically ill.

                                       Selling a life insurance policy (or the right to receive the death benefit) to any person other
                                       than the insurance company that issued the policy is a transaction known as a viatical or
                                       life settlement. NASAA concludes that these settlements, regardless of the health status or
                                       age of the insured, are securities. All persons involved in the offer and/or sale of viatical or
                                       life settlements should be aware of the nature and extent of the registration and antifraud
                                       provisions of state securities laws, as well as the applicability of these provisions to every offer
                                       and/or sale of a security. Because licensing is done on a state-by-state basis, there is little
                                       uniformity. Some states require just a life insurance license, some require both a life insurance
                                       and a life settlement license, and some require either or both of these and being licensed
                                       as a securities agent. As with so much else, the regulators are concerned about suitability
                                       and disclosure. When a life insurance policy is sold to an investor, the buyer is acquiring a
                                       financial interest in the insured’s death. In addition to paying a lump sum, the purchaser
                                       agrees to pay any premiums that are necessary to support the cost of the policy for as long
                                       as the insured lives. In exchange, the buyer will receive the death benefit upon death of the
                                       insured. It is important to be aware of the risks involved in this activity:
                                        Because there is no active secondary market for these policies, it is difficult to arrive at a
                                          fair evaluation, and the investor may wind up paying too much for the policy;
                                        The chance that the insured will live longer than anticipated—the more the insured’s life
                                          exceeds the projected expectancy, the lower the return to the investor;
                                        The possibility, remote as it is, that the insurance company will not be financially able to
                                          honor the claim; and
                                        The intangible moral issue of the investor knowing that the sooner the insured dies, the
                                          greater the return.

                                    LO 5.e Contrast passive and active real estate investing.

                                    We have already discussed two methods of passive real estate investing—that is, investing in
                                    real estate where all of the work is done for the investor. That is the case with the REIT and
                                    the real estate limited partnership investment (DPP). Investing in real estate, whether it be
                                    single-family homes to flip or to rent or commercial property, involves work on the part of
                                    the investor. Whether it is collection of rents, finding tenants, or doing repairs, the investor is
                                    responsible for doing the work (or hiring someone to do it).

                                    One of the other differences is taxation. As a passive investor, the income to an owner of a
                                    real estate limited partnership (DPP) is considered passive income (taxed as ordinary income)
                                    while losses are passive losses and can be deducted, but only from passive income. For active
                                    investors, it can get quite complicated (and beyond the scope of the exam). However, you
                                    should know that there are cases where the activity level is such that the investor is deemed to
                                    be buying and selling real estate (such a flipping homes) as a business, not as an investment.
                                    That could lead to losses being deducted from regular income, rather than passive income, as
                                    ordinary loss.


                                    LO 5.f Identify the different types of commodities and precious
                                    metals that are popular investments.

                                    In the previous unit, we discussed futures. They are one of the methods by which individual
                                    investors can invest directly in commodities (forwards are used primarily by producers
                                    and industrial consumers). One can also invest indirectly through ETPs (exchange-traded
                                    products, such as ETFs, that follow a commodity index) or mutual funds that invest in
                                    commodity-related businesses. For instance, an oil and gas fund would own stocks issued by
                                    companies involved in energy exploration, refining, storage, and distribution.

                                    Historically, most commodity trading was of agricultural products (we were an agrarian
                                    society), and these commodities, such as corn, wheat, oats and soybeans, are still actively
                                    traded. There are also animal-based commodities, such as beef, pork, and eggs. Today, the
                                    most commonly traded commodity is crude oil, with coffee often claimed to be in second
                                    place. And, of course, for all of you Eddie Murphy fans (remember the movie Trading Places),
                                    there are frozen orange juice futures.

                                    Active trading also takes place in industrial metals, such as aluminum, nickel, copper, and
                                    lead. These are not considered precious metals. Speaking of metals, it is hard to turn on the TV
                                    today without seeing a commercial for gold or silver investments. Whether you agree or not
                                    with the ads, for millennia, individuals and governments have stored their wealth in precious
                                    metals.

          LESSON 5.4: BENEFITS AND RISKS OF ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS
                                       LO 5.g Describe the benefits and risks of alternative investments in
                                       client portfolios.

                                       Most alternative investments share similar benefits and risks. Usually, these investments offer
                                       low or even negative correlation to the stock market, resulting in greater diversification of the
                                       portfolio. This can lead to greater overall long-term returns with reduced risk. In some cases,
                                       there are opportunities for abnormal returns, high and low.

                                       As was done with pooled investment vehicles in Unit 3, we’ll take these one at a time.


                                       DPPs
                                       The DPP investor enjoys several advantages, including:
                                        an investment managed by others;
                                        flow-through of income and certain expenses; and
                                        limited liability—the most the investors can lose is the amount of their investment plus
                                          any funds committed for, but not yet remitted.

                                       The exam will probably give more attention to the following disadvantages.
                                        Liquidity Risk. The greatest disadvantage is lack of liquidity. Because the secondary
                                          market for DPPs is limited, investors who want to sell their interests frequently cannot
                                          locate buyers.
                                        Legislative Risk. When Congress changes tax laws, new rules can cause substantial
                                          damage to LPs, who may be locked into illiquid investments that lose previously assumed
                                          tax advantages.
                                        Risk of Audit. Statistics from the IRS indicate that reporting ownership of a DPP results
                                          in a significantly higher percentage of returns selected for audit.
                                        Depreciation Recapture. One of the tax benefits is the ability to depreciate most fixed
                                          assets, especially when that depreciation can be accelerated. The effect of the depreciation
                                          deduction is to lower the tax basis of the asset. If that asset is then sold for more than that
                                          basis, the excess is “recaptured” and subject to tax, possibly at ordinary income tax rates.
                                          You won’t need to know anything more than the concept.

                                               PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   Benefits of investing in a DPP would include
                                                      I. high liquidity.
                                                     II. flow-through of operating losses.
                                                    III. limited liability.
                                                    IV. immunization against tax audit.
                                                     A. I and II
                                                     B. I and IV
                                                     C. II and III
                                                     D. III and IV
                                                   Answer: C. DPPs are structured as flow-through entities, giving their investors
                                                   opportunity to receive income without the partnership being taxed first. In addition,
                                                   if there are losses, they get the opportunity to write off those losses against passive
                                                   income from other DPPs. As limited partnership vehicles, they offer their investors
                                                   liability limited to their investment. They generally have very low liquidity, and,
                                                   instead of reducing the tax audit risk, they actually increase it.


                                    Real Estate
                                    Real estate investing offers several benefits.
                                     Historically, real estate has been a hedge against inflation.
                                     It provides rental income (cash flow), a portion of which may be tax advantaged due to
                                       depreciation and interest deductions.
                                     It offers high leverage. Real estate loans generally require a relatively small down payment.
                                     Investment real estate is not generally correlated with stock market returns.
                                    Investors should also be aware of some of the risks.
                                     In general, a lack of liquidity (certainly when compared to stocks, bonds, or mutual
                                       funds) is a risk.
                                     If purchased for rental, each month that the property is not rented is money lost.
                                     High leverage can work against the investor in a down market.
                                     The individual just might not have the skills necessary to manage the property, and hiring
                                       someone else could eliminate or greatly reduce the profits.

                                    Any good asset allocation program should have real estate, but other than owning your own
                                    home, at least for most investors, REITs are probably the preferred option.

                                               PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   Among the reasons for investors to consider investing in real estate would be all of
                                                   the following except
                                                     A. the ability to increase returns through leverage.
                                                    B. a high correlation with stock market returns.

                                                   Answer: B. One of the investment advantages of real estate is that returns are
                                                   generally negatively correlated with those of the stock market.

                                       Risks of Structured Products
                                       There are several risks involved with structured products. First, because of the customized
                                       nature of these products, there is little or no liquidity. Second, in most cases, these are
                                       structured so that the returns are not fully realized until maturity. As a result, these should
                                       appeal to buy and hold investors rather than short-term traders. There is also the matter of
                                       credit risk, so it is important to know the strength of the financial institution who is the
                                       issuer. Finally, as with most alternative investments, there is a lack of efficient pricing. That is,
                                       the actual market price does not necessarily reflect the real value. This can lead to abnormal
                                       returns, good and bad.

          LESSON 6.1: ECONOMIC THEORIES
                                      LO 6.a Analyze the four stages of the business cycle.


                                      Business Cycles
                                      Business cycles reflect fluctuations in economic activity as measured by the level of activity in
                                      such variables as the rate of unemployment and the GDP. Periods of economic expansion have
                                      been followed by periods of contraction in a pattern called the business cycle. Business cycles
                                      go through four stages:
                                       Expansion
                                       Peak
                                       Contraction
                                       Trough
                                      Definition: gross domestic product (GDP). GDP is the market value of all final goods and
                                      services produced within a country in a given period of time. To account for inflation, GDP
                                      in the United States is based on a constant dollar, currently the value in 2012.

                                      Expansion, or recovery, is characterized by increasing business activity—in sales,
                                      manufacturing, and wages—throughout the economy. When GDP increases rapidly and
                                      businesses reach their productive capacity, the nation’s economy cannot expand further. At
                                      this point, the economy is said to have reached its peak. When business activity declines from
                                      its peak, the economy is contracting.

                                      Economists call mild short-term contractions recessions. Longer, more severe contractions are
                                      depressions. When business activity stops declining and levels off, the cycle makes a trough.

                                      According to the U.S. Department of Commerce, the economy is in a recession when
                                      a decline in real output of goods and services—the GDP—continues for two or more
                                      consecutive quarters. It defines a depression as a decrease in GDP for six consecutive quarters.

                                    The Four Stages of the Business Cycle
                                    To determine the economy’s overall direction, economists consider many trends in business activity.

                                    Expansions are characterized by increasing consumer demand for goods and services, possibly
                                                                                                                                           Unit 6
                                    leading to:
                                     an increasing rate of inflation; and
                                     increasing industrial production, generally leading to
                                        –– a decreasing unemployment rate as hiring accelerates,
                                        –– falling inventories,
                                        –– rising stock markets,
                                        –– rising property values, and
                                        –– increasing GDP.

                                    Peaks are characterized by:
                                     a decrease to the GDP growth rate;
                                     a decrease to the unemployment rate, but a slowdown in hiring;
                                     a slower rate of growth in consumer spending and business investment; and
                                     an increase to the inflation rate.
                                    Contractions/recessions in the business cycle tend to be characterized by:
                                     rising numbers of bankruptcies and bond defaults;
                                     decreasing working hours and increasing unemployment rate;
                                     decreasing consumer spending, home construction, and business investment;
                                     falling stock markets;
                                     a decrease to the inflation rate;
                                     rising inventories (a sign of slackening consumer demand); and
                                     a negative growth rate for the GDP.
                                    Troughs tend to be characterized by:
                                     a change from negative to positive GDP growth rate;
                                     a high unemployment rate and increasing use of overtime and temporary workers;
                                     a possible increase in spending on consumer durable goods and housing; and
                                     a moderate or decreasing inflation rate.

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   If the Consumer Price Index (CPI) is down but consumer demand is up, the economy

                                                     D. Contraction to trough
                                                   Answer: A. As prices trend downward and consumer demand increases, the

                                                   continues to increase, assuming supply remains constant, upward pressure will be
                                                   put on prices through the expansion to the peak.

                                      Analysts will frequently make investment decisions based upon where we are in the business
                                      cycle. Certain industries outperform while others underperform at different points in the
                                      cycle. Following are several examples.


                                      Cyclical Industries
                                      Cyclical industries are highly sensitive to business cycles and inflation trends. Most cyclical
                                      industries produce durable goods, such as heavy machinery and automobiles, as well as raw
                                      materials, such as steel.

                                      During recessions, the demand for durable goods declines as manufacturers postpone
                                      investments in new capital goods and consumers postpone purchases of automobiles. On the
                                      other hand, countercyclical industries tend to turn down as the economy heats up and to rise
                                      when the economy turns down. Gold mining has historically been a countercyclical industry.


                                      Growth Industries
                                      Most industries pass through four phases during their existence: introduction, growth,
                                      maturity, and decline. An industry is considered in its growth phase if the industry is growing
                                      faster than the economy as a whole because of technological changes, new products, or
                                      changing consumer tastes. Social media and bioengineering are examples of current growth
                                      industries. Because many growth companies retain nearly all of their earnings to finance their
                                      business expansion, growth stocks usually pay little or no dividends.


                                      Defensive Industries
                                      Defensive industries are least affected by normal business cycles. Companies in defensive
                                      industries generally produce nondurable consumer goods, such as food, pharmaceuticals, tobacco,
                                      and energy. Public consumption of such goods remains fairly steady throughout the business cycle.

                                      During recessions and bear markets, stocks in defensive industries generally decline less than
                                      stocks in other industries. During expansions and bull markets, defensive stocks may advance
                                      less. Investments in defensive industries tend to involve less risk and, consequently, lower
                                      investment returns. Those using sector rotation will “rotate” into defensive issues when it
                                      appears the business cycle is headed into the contraction phase.

                                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                        Let’s make sure you understand these terms:
                                                        An investor fears a coming recession. She would probably invest in
                                                         A. biotech.
                                                         B. steel producers.
                                                         C. drug companies.
                                                         D. home builders.
                                                        Answer: C. In a recessionary period, business activity slows, so one should take a
                                                        defensive position. Drug companies (pharmaceuticals) tend to have steady earnings,
                                                        even in bad economic times. After all, those taking needed prescription drugs will
                                                        not stop. Even OTC drugs like headache remedies and antacids will continue to be
                                                        sold (some say even more in a downturn). People generally don’t buy a new home
                                                        when things slow down, nor do they buy new cars (much of the steel produced
                                                        goes into the manufacturing of autos). Biotech companies will find that funding for
                                                        experimental treatments dries up.

                                               PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   When the business cycle is in the recovery stage, what type of industry tends to
                                                   perform the best?
                                                    A. Countercyclical

                                                                                                                                              Unit 6

                                                    D. Growth
                                                   Answer: B. In general cyclical industries, those that follow the cycle tend to be
                                                   the best performers during expansion (recovery). Countercyclical industries would
                                                   tend to go in the opposite direction, and defensive industries are billed as such
                                                   because they tend to be stable regardless of where we are in the business cycle. Most
                                                   economists would agree that growth industries react later as the recovery gets closer
                                                   to the peak.



                                    LO 6.b Identify the three types of yield curves and how they reflect
                                    interest rates.

                                    Although interest rates in general reflect investor expectations about inflation, short-term rates
                                    reflect the policy decisions of the Federal Reserve Board (FRB) as it implements the nation’s
                                    monetary policy.


                                    Interest Rates
                                    An interest rate is the cost of borrowing money. The rate a borrower pays for funds is
                                    determined by the supply and demand for loanable funds, the credit quality of the borrower,
                                    and the length of time for which money is borrowed. In addition, the cost of funds is
                                    influenced by factors not related to the borrower, such as current and expected inflation.

                                    When a company borrows money by issuing bonds, the bonds have a fixed interest rate, or
                                    coupon payment. As interest rates fluctuate, the price of the bonds in the secondary market
                                    also fluctuates. When interest rates increase, bond prices decrease; when interest rates decrease,
                                    bond prices increase. Thus, there is an inverse relationship between interest rates and bond
                                    prices.


                                    Nominal Interest Rates
                                    The nominal rate of interest is the actual rate of interest a borrower pays on the borrowed
                                    money. If inflation is expected, it is likely that interest rates are going to increase. That
                                    means that new loans (e.g., bonds) will carry a nominal rate higher than the bonds currently
                                    available. As a result, as interest rates rise, market forces will lead the price of those older,
                                    lower-interest-rate bonds to decline. That is because an investor’s rate of return needs to be
                                    equivalent to current market conditions.

                                                        EXAMPLE
                                                        Although covered in Unit 2, here is a refresher. A bond has a nominal yield of 5%. That
                                                        means it is paying 5% interest annually on the loan, or $50 on each $1,000 bond. If
                                                        interest rates rise to 7%, where a newly issued bond is paying $70 per year, would
                                                        you pay $1,000 to buy the bond paying $50 per year? Probably not. To make the “old”
                                                        bond attractive to investors, the price will have to decline. In this case, it might sell
                                                        for approximately $700. Why? Because receiving $50 per year (the loan rate is a fixed
                                                        percentage of the $1,000 loan) on an investment of $700 give you a return of just a bit
                                                        over 7% (50 / 700 = 7.14%).


                                      Yield Curve Analysis
                                      An important tool in gauging investor sentiment toward future interest rates is analyzing the
                                      yield curve.

                                      Plotted on a graph, the difference between short- and long-term interest rates normally reflects
                                      an upward sloping line known as the yield curve. When it is an upward sloping curve, it is a
                                      positive, or normal, yield curve. Long-term interest rates are normally higher than short-term
                                      rates for a number of reasons. Lenders must be compensated for the:
                                       time value of money;
                                       reduced buying power of money resulting from inflation;
                                       increased risk of default over long periods; and
                                       loss of liquidity associated with long-term investments.
                                      The yield curve is also a reflection of investor expectations about inflation. If investors expect
                                      high inflation rates, they will require higher rates of return to compensate for the reduction in
                                      purchasing power over time.

                                                        TAKE NOTE
                                                        When the yield curve is normal, long-term interest rates are higher than short-term
                                                        interest rates. On a graph, the normal yield curve is upward sloping.

                                    In unusual circumstances, the yield curve can be inverted, or downward sloping. An inverted
                                    or negative yield curve can be the result of high current demand for money relative to the
                                    available supply. Short-term interest rates tend to be more sensitive to Fed policy than
                                    long-term rates. An inverted yield curve may occur because of a sharp increase in short-term
                                    rates. Therefore, when you notice a negative yield curve, you can expect that interest rates
                                    have rapidly risen and, according to most analysts, they will soon retreat.                                        Unit 6

                                    When short-term and long-term rates are the same, it is called a flat yield curve.

                                                      You will need to be able to recognize the different yield curves from their shape. A
                                                      normal (positive) curve slopes upward. An inverted (negative) curve slopes downward.
                                                      And there is such a thing as a flat yield curve, which, as the name implies, is level
                                                      throughout all of the maturities.

                                                      TAKE NOTE
                                                      The shape of the yield curve varies with changes in the economic cycle.
                                                       A normal, or ascending, yield curve occurs during periods of economic

                                                       A flat yield curve occurs when no change in interest rates is expected.

                                                         has tightened credit in an overheating economy; it predicts that rates will fall in
                                                         the future.
                                                       Yield curves for issuers with different risk levels can be compared to make
                                                         economic predictions.


                                    Yield Spread (Credit Spread)
                                    It should be obvious that the greater the risk, the higher the yield on the bond. Many analysts
                                    compare the difference between yields on bonds with the same maturity but different quality
                                    (ratings) to get a sense of the market sentiment. One common measurement is the difference
                                    in yields between Treasuries and corporate bonds. This difference is called the yield spread and
                                    tends to widen when economic conditions sour and narrow when they get better.

                                      Yield spread can also be used between issues of the same issuer. For example, one of the most
                                      popular measurements of attitudes regarding future economic conditions is the yield spread
                                      between the 2-year Treasury note and the 10-year Treasury note. When investors are feeling
                                      optimistic about the economy, the yield spread narrows; when pessimistic, the yield spread
                                      widens.

                                                  EXAMPLE
                                                  How is the yield spread predictive?

                                                     a recession is expected. Investors have chosen the safety of government bonds
                                                     over higher corporate yields, which occurs when the economy slows down.

                                                     an economic expansion is expected, and so investors are willing to take risks.
                                                     They will sell government bonds to buy higher-yielding corporates.

                                                  When constructing a yield curve, the method is to use bonds of a single issuer over
                                                  varying maturities. Specifically, most rely on the curve drawn when plotting yields on
                                                  U.S. Treasury securities, starting with the 91-day T-bill and ending with anything from
                                                  the 10-year note to the 30-year bond.

                                                        A bond analyst is plotting a yield curve and notices that short-term maturities have
                                                        higher yields than intermediate and long-term maturities. This is an example of

                                                         D. an algorithmic yield curve.
                                                        Answer: A. An inverted, or negative, yield curve is one that results when debts with
                                                        short-term maturities has higher yields than those with maturities that are longer. A
                                                        positive, or normal, yield curve results when the yields increase as maturities do.

                                    The economic climate has an enormous effect on the conditions of individual companies and,
                                    therefore, the securities markets. In addition to a company’s earnings and business prospects,
                                    any changes in government policy, business cycles, money supply, and Federal Reserve Board
                                    (FRB) actions affect securities prices and trading and the markets at large. In today’s global
                                    economy, economic conditions abroad can influence the conditions domestically and in turn
                                    will also impact our securities markets. This unit will explore some of these factors.

                                    Fiscal policy refers to a government’s use of spending and taxation to influence economic
                                    activity. The budget is said to be balanced when tax revenues equal government expenditures.
                                    A budget surplus occurs when government tax revenues exceed expenditures, and a budget
                                    deficit occurs when government expenditures exceed tax revenues.

                                    Monetary policy refers to the central bank’s actions that affect the quantity of money and
                                    credit in an economy in order to influence economic activity. Monetary policy is said to be
                                    expansionary (or accommodative or easy) when the central bank increases the quantity of
                                    money and credit in an economy. Conversely, when the central bank is reducing the quantity
                                    of money and credit in an economy, the monetary policy is said to be contractionary
                                    (or restrictive or tight). Monetary policy is under the control of the Federal Reserve Board
                                    (the Fed).

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              It is important for you to know that the fiscal policy of the United States is determined
                                              by the president and Congress through the process of budgeting and taxation. The
                                              budget is presented by the president and, usually after some negotiation, approved
                                              by Congress. The final step is the signature of the president. Monetary policy is
                                              determined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Unlike
                                              monetary policy, the Federal Reserve has nothing to do with fiscal policy.


                                    Major Schools of Economics
                                    Keynesian Economics
                                    Named after the economist John Maynard Keynes (pronounced “Canes”), Keynesian
                                    economists recognize the importance of government intervention. In 1936, Keynes published
                                    The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, in which he revolutionized the way
                                    economists think about macroeconomics. He laid out how and why recessions happen and
                                    what must be done to recover from them. His strategy for recovery from a recession was
                                    for governments to run deficits to stimulate demand and employment. In other words, he
                                    suggested lower levels of taxation and more government spending.


                                    Classical and Supply-Side Economics
                                    Classical economists favor a school of thought referred to as supply-side economics. The
                                    most notable feature of this idea is the belief that lower taxes and less government regulation
                                    benefits consumers through a greater supply of goods and services at lower costs. Supply-side
                                    economics holds that supply creates demand by providing jobs and wages. The prices of
                                    goods of which there is excess supply will fall, and the prices of goods in demand will rise.

                                      Monetarist Theory
                                      Monetarists, such as the late Milton Friedman, believe that the quantity of money, or money
                                      supply, determines overall price levels and economic activity. Too many dollars chasing too
                                      few goods leads to inflation, and too few dollars chasing too many goods leads to deflation.
                                      One of the principal roles of the Federal Reserve Board is monitoring the money supply and
                                      making adjustments when necessary.


                                      Tools of the Federal Reserve Board
                                      Because the Federal Reserve Board (the Fed) determines how much money is available for
                                      businesses and consumers to spend, its decisions are critical to the U.S. economy. There are
                                      three primary tools employed to affect the money supply.
                                       Changes in reserve requirements. By raising the amount of funds commercial banks
                                         must leave on deposit with the Fed, the amount of money available for these banks to
                                         lend out is decreased. This shrinkage of the money supply generally translates into higher
                                         interest rates. The reverse is true when reserve requirements are eased.
                                       Changes in the discount rate. This is the rate the Fed charges member banks when
                                         lending them money. Higher rates discourage borrowing, reducing the money supply,
                                         with lower rates having an opposite effect.
                                       Open-market operations. The Fed buys and sells U.S. Treasury securities in the open
                                         market under the direction of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). When
                                         Treasuries are purchased, it adds to the money supply. This is because the FOMC is
                                         purchasing these securities from commercial banks, causing the banks to have greater
                                         reserves. When the FOMC sells Treasuries, the money supply is reduced because funds are
                                         pulled out of the bank’s reserves to pay for those securities. This is the most actively used
                                         Fed tool.

                                      There is a fourth item that, although not set by the Fed, is highly influenced by their actions.
                                      That item is the federal funds rate. The federal funds rate is the rate banks that are members
                                      of the Federal Reserve System charge each other for overnight loans of $1 million or more.
                                      The rate is considered a barometer of the direction of short-term interest rates. The federal
                                      funds rate is listed in daily newspapers and is the most volatile rate; it can fluctuate drastically
                                      under certain market conditions.

                                                  TAKE NOTE
                                                  The Federal Reserve Board establishes the discount rate. The discount rate, unlike
                                                  the federal funds rate, is a managed rate. It is one of the tools of monetary policy. In
                                                  contrast, the federal funds rate is a market rate determined by the demand for bank
                                                  reserves on the part of deposit-based financial institutions.

                                      One final rate to discuss is the prime rate. The prime rate is the most preferential interest
                                      rate on corporate loans at large U.S. money center commercial banks. Each bank sets its own
                                      prime rate, with larger banks generally setting the rate that other banks follow. Banks lower
                                      their prime rates when the Fed eases the money supply and raise rates when the Fed contracts
                                      the money supply.

                                                  U.S. economy is not true?
                                                   A. The federal funds rate is the rate the Federal Reserve charges for overnight

                                                                                                                                                 Unit 6
                                                        loans to member commercial banks.
                                                   B. The prime rate is the interest rate that large U.S. money center commercial
                                                        banks charge their most creditworthy corporate borrowers.
                                                   C. The discount rate is the rate the New York Federal Reserve Bank charges for
                                                        short-term loans to member banks.
                                                   D. The most active tool used by the Fed is the buying and selling of Treasury
                                                        securities by the FOMC.
                                                  Answer: A. The federal funds rate is the rate that member banks charge each other
                                                  for overnight loans of $1 million or more; it is not the rate that the Federal Reserve
                                                  charges member banks for overnight loans.

                                              Although the Fed’s actions certainly impact all interest rates, you’ll need to know that
                                              the Fed does not set the prime rate—that is done by the major commercial banks.

                                    Definition: balance of payments. The balance of payments measures all the nation’s import
                                    and export transactions with those of other countries for the year. The balance of payments
                                    account contains all payments and liabilities to foreigners (debits) and all payments and
                                    obligations (credits) received from foreigners.

                                                  If the U.S. dollar weakens, meaning it buys less of a foreign currency such as Japanese
                                                  yen, it makes U.S. exports more competitive in foreign markets. Conversely, if the
                                                  U.S. dollar strengthens and buys more yen per dollar, it makes U.S. exports less
                                                  competitive in foreign markets.

                                                  TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                  One way an investor can protect against a weakening U.S. dollar is to invest in foreign
                                                  securities. In Unit 1, we discussed the American depositary receipt (ADR), the simplest
                                                  way to invest in individual foreign securities.


                                      Balance of Trade
                                      The largest component of a country’s balance of payments is usually its balance of trade—that
                                      is, comparing the country’s exports to its imports.


                                      Trade Deficit
                                      A trade deficit is an excess of one country’s imports over its exports and is reported as part
                                      of the balance of payments figures. Over time, an excessive trade deficit can lead to the
                                      devaluation of a country’s currency because the country will be converting, or selling, its
                                      currency to obtain foreign currency to pay for its increasing imports.


                                      Trade Surplus
                                      The opposite of a trade deficit, a trade surplus is an excess of one country’s exports over its
                                      imports and is reported as part of the balance of payments figures. Over time, an excessive
                                      trade surplus can lead to the strengthening of a country’s currency.

                                                  EXAMPLE
                                                  On the U.S. credit side are sales of American products to foreign countries. On the
                                                  debit side are American purchases of foreign goods that cause American dollars
                                                  to flow out of the country. When debits exceed credits, a deficit in the balance of
                                                  payments occurs; when credits exceed debits, a surplus exists.

                                                  EXAMPLE
                                                  If the dollar value of French perfume imported into the U.S. is greater than the dollar
                                                  value of Kentucky bourbon exported to France, the difference results in a negative
                                                  trade balance, creating a debit to the U.S. trade account and a credit to France’s.

                                           Analytical Methodology
                                           There are two popular methods used by analysts to help them determine where the best
                                           investment opportunities lie.


                                           Top-Down Analysis
                                           If we were to draw a picture of top-down analysis, it would look like an inverted isosceles
                                           triangle: broad on top and narrow on the bottom. The analyst starts with the broadest
                                           measure of the overall economy and then successively narrows it down to finally select the
                                           company or companies that best fit the objectives.


                                           Bottom-Up Analysis
                                           This is the direct opposite of top down. In this case, we merely start at the bottom (the point)
                                           of the triangle with the specific company and work our way up through the industry and then
                                           the economy. This analyst starts with the narrowest indicator and then steadily broadens the
                                           search.


                                           LO 6.d Differentiate between inflation and deflation and how they
                                           are affected by the major economic indicators.


                                           Inflation
                                           Inflation is a general increase in prices as measured by an index such as the Consumer Price
                                           Index (CPI), described in detail shortly. Mild inflation can encourage economic growth
                                           because gradually increasing prices tend to stimulate business investments. High inflation
                                           reduces a dollar’s buying power, which can reduce demand for goods and services. A term that
                                           may appear on your exam is “inflation inertia.” This is the concept that the rate of inflation
                                           does not immediately react to unexpected changes in economic conditions; rather, it lags
                                           behind, sometimes for several quarters, before there is an effect.

                                           Sometimes the term inertial rate of inflation or inertial inflation is used. This is the persistent
                                           rate of inflation that continues at the same rate until an economic shock leads to a change.
                                           One of the results of this is that prices rarely go down. After all, what company wants to lower
                                           the prices of its goods or services, and how many workers are willing to accept wage cuts? So,
                                           prices generally continue to advance, hopefully at a slow rate.

                                                  TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                  Because inflation is a global issue, not just confined to the United States and our
                                                  dollar, a universal definition would be “a decrease in the value of the monetary unit.”

                                      Inflation is caused by excessive demand and monetary expansion. Excessive demand occurs when
                                      aggregate demand exceeds the aggregate supply and prices rise. Monetary expansion is a
                                      rapid increase in a nation’s money stock in excess of the nation’s growth rate.

                                      Increased inflation drives interest rates higher and drives bond prices lower. Decreases in the
                                      inflation rate have the opposite effect: bond yields decline and bond prices rise, as you will
                                      learn shortly.

                                                  TAKE NOTE
                                                  An increase in real income means the percentage increase in income is greater than
                                                  the rate of inflation. Buying power has increased.


                                      Deflation
                                      Though rare, deflation is a general decline in prices. Deflation usually occurs during severe
                                      recessions when unemployment is on the rise. Deflation is caused by conditions opposite
                                      those that cause inflation. Basically, when the demand for goods and services is substantially
                                      below the supply of those goods or services, prices tend to drift downward (certainly not
                                      increase) to encourage an increased demand. One other possible cause of deflation is a severe
                                      shrinkage in the money supply.

                                            If                     And                     Then                   Thus
                                            inflation increases    interest rates go up    bond prices go down bond yields go up
                                            inflation decreases interest rates go down bond prices go up          bond yields go down


                                                  TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                  It is not unusual to experience deflation during recessionary periods. At those times,
                                                  investors tend to flee to safe havens such as U.S. government securities because unlike
                                                  stocks, real estate, and commodities, Treasuries will likely not only hold their value but
                                                  may even show some capital appreciation.

                                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                        The contraction phase of the business cycle is least likely accompanied by decreasing

                                                         D. unemployment.
                                                        Answer: D. An economic contraction is likely to feature increasing unemployment
                                                        (i.e., decreasing employment), along with decreasing consumer spending, declining
                                                        economic output, and decreasing inflation pressure.

                                    Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
                                    In LO 6.a, we defined gross domestic product and how it is affected by the business cycle.
                                    Let’s take a deeper dive into the subject. Gross domestic product (GDP) expresses the total
                                    value of all final goods and services produced within the United States during the year. GDP
                                    includes personal consumption (by far the largest component), government spending, gross                 Unit 6
                                    private investment, foreign investment, and the total value of net exports. If imports exceed
                                    exports, that negatively affects GDP, and that net amount is subtracted. The GDP measures a
                                    country’s output produced within its borders regardless of who generated it. When the GDP
                                    is negative, it is generally a sign of deflation.

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  A U.S.-based firm assembles electronic equipment using parts imported from
                                                  Singapore. Its income statement looks like this:
                                                  Sales          $60 million
                                                  Wages          $30 million
                                                  Parts          $16 million
                                                  Expenses       $46 million
                                                  Net Income     $14 million
                                                  What is this firm’s contribution to the U.S. GDP?
                                                   A. $14 million
                                                   B. $30 million
                                                   C. $44 million
                                                   D. $60 million
                                                  Answer: C. The question is how we measure this firm’s contribution to U.S. output.
                                                  At first glance, the answer would seem to be $60 million, the total value of its sales.
                                                  However, $16 million of this was produced somewhere else, so it shouldn’t be
                                                  counted as part of the firm’s—or the United States’—output. Thus, the correct answer
                                                  is $44 million, the amount of value the firm has added to the imported parts.


                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              The exam may want you to know that net exports will lead to an increase in GDP.


                                    Employment Indicators
                                    The unemployment level is a key indicator of a country’s economic health and bears a
                                    relationship to inflation. The two most common employment indicators are the average
                                    weekly initial claims for unemployment compensation and the average workweek in
                                    manufacturing. Both measures serve to predict the direction of economic activity. Many
                                    economists believe an unemployment level of about 4% reflects full employment, the point at
                                    which wage pressures do not create undue inflation.


                                    Consumer Price Index (CPI)
                                    The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the general retail price level. By comparing
                                    the current cost of buying a basket of goods with the cost of buying the same basket a year
                                    ago, we can get an indication of changes in the cost of living. In doing so, the CPI figure
                                    attempts to measure the rate of increase or decrease in a broad range of prices, such as food,
                                    housing, transportation, medical care, clothing, electricity, entertainment, and services. The

                                      CPI is published on a monthly basis by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and is the most
                                      commonly used measurement of the rate of inflation.

                                                  TAKE NOTE
                                                  The index for all items, less food and energy, is often unofficially referred to as the core
                                                  CPI, a term created by the media and not the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The reasoning
                                                  behind excluding food and energy prices when computing core inflation is because of
                                                  their high short-term volatility.


                                      Barometers of Economic Activity
                                      Certain aspects of economic activity serve as barometers, or indicators, of business cycle
                                      phases. There are three broad categories of economic indicators: leading, coincident, and
                                      lagging. These indicators are published on a monthly basis by The Conference Board, a
                                      nongovernmental, not-for-profit research organization.


                                      Leading Indicators
                                      Leading indicators are economic activities that tend to turn down before the beginning of a
                                      recession or turn up before the beginning of a business expansion. These indicators are used
                                      by economists to predict the future direction of economic activity four to six months hence.
                                      The leading economic indicators include the following:
                                       Money supply
                                       Building permits (housing starts)
                                       Average weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance
                                       Average weekly working hours, manufacturing
                                       Manufacturers’ new orders for consumer goods
                                       Manufacturers’ new orders for nondefense capital goods
                                       Index of supplier deliveries—vendor performance
                                       Interest rate spread between 10-year Treasury bonds and the federal funds rate
                                       Stock prices (e.g., S&P 500)
                                       Index of consumer expectations
                                      Not all leading indicators move in tandem. Positive changes in a majority of leading indicators
                                      point to increased spending, production, and employment. This will generally result in an
                                      increase to the rate of inflation. Negative changes in a majority of indicators can forecast a
                                      recession.


                                      Coincident (or Current) Indicators
                                      Coincident, or current, indicators are economic measurements that change directly and
                                      simultaneously with the business cycle. Widely used coincident indicators include the
                                      following:
                                       Nonagricultural employment
                                       Personal income minus Social Security, veteran benefits, and welfare payments

                                    Lagging Indicators
                                    Lagging indicators are measurements that change four to six months after the economy
                                    has begun a new trend and serve to confirm the new trend. Lagging indicators help analysts
                                    differentiate long-term trends from short-term reversals that occur in any trend. Lagging
                                    indicators include the following:
                                     Average duration of unemployment
                                     Ratio of consumer installment credit to personal income
                                     Ratio of manufacturing and trade inventories to sales
                                     Average prime rate
                                     Change in the CPI for services
                                     Total amount of commercial and industrial loans outstanding
                                     Change in the index of labor cost per unit of output (manufacturing)

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              Simply stated, these indicators attempt to tell us where we’re going (leading), where
                                              we are (coincident), and where we’ve been (lagging). As an IAR, we suspect you’d
                                              be most interested in knowing where we’re going, so you’d pay most attention (as
                                              everyone else does) to the leading indicators.

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   Core inflation is best described as an inflation rate
                                                    A. for producers’ raw materials.

                                                    D. that represents a market basket of consumer items.
                                                   Answer: C. Core inflation is measured using a price index that excludes food and
                                                   energy prices.

             LEARNING OBJECTIVES
                                    When you have completed this unit, you will be able to accomplish the following.
                                    ❯❯ LO 7.a	Recognize the relationship between assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity.
                                    ❯❯ LO 7.b	Identify the effects on the balance sheet from certain corporate actions.
                                    ❯❯ LO 7.c	Recognize income statement items.
                                    ❯❯ LO 7.d	Identify the use of the statement of cash flows.
                                    ❯❯ LO 7.e	Distinguish between the different forms used in SEC reporting.

                                    Your exam will include approximately four questions from the topics covered in Unit 7.


             INTRODUCTION
                                    This unit deals with the methods used by publicly traded companies to report their financial
                                    results. Just as a credit card company evaluates your financial condition when determining if
                                    you are worthy of their credit card (and the amount of your credit limit), analysts view the
                                    company’s financial statement to determine the strength of the issuer and growth and/or income
                                    opportunities for investors.


             LESSON 7.1: THE USE OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

                                    LO 7.a Recognize the relationship between assets, liabilities, and
                                    owners’ equity.

                                    A corporation’s financial statements provide a fundamental analyst with the information
                                    needed to assess that corporation’s profitability, liquidity, financial strength (ability of cash flow
                                    to meet debt payments), and operating efficiency. By examining how certain numbers from
                                    one statement relate to prior statements and how the resulting ratios relate to the company’s
                                    competitors, the analyst can determine how financially viable the company is.

                                                                                                                                       135

          136        Unit 7   Financial Reporting



                                       Publicly traded companies issue quarterly and annual financial reports to the SEC. A
                                       company’s balance sheet and income statement are included in these reports.


                                       Balance Sheet
                                       The balance sheet provides a snapshot of a company’s financial position at a specific point in time.
                                       It identifies the value of the company’s assets (what it owns) and its liabilities (what it owes). The
                                       difference between these two figures is the corporation’s owners’ equity, or net worth.

                                       The balance sheet equation is:

                                       Assets – liabilities = owners’ equity; or

                                       Assets = liabilities + owners’ equity.

                                       The balance sheet gets its name from the fact that its two sides must balance. The balance
                                       sheet equation mathematically expresses the relationship between the two sides of the
                                       balance sheet. Simply stated, everything that is owned (assets) minus everything that is owed
                                       (liabilities) is equal to the net worth (owners’ or shareholders’ equity) of the entity.


                                       Assets
                                       Assets appear on the balance sheet in order of liquidity, which is the ease with which they can
                                       be turned into cash. Assets that are most readily turned into cash are listed first, followed by
                                       less liquid assets. Balance sheets commonly identify three types of assets: current assets (cash
                                       and assets easily turned into cash), fixed assets (physical assets that could eventually be sold),
                                       and other assets (usually intangible and only of value to the corporation that owns them).


                                       Current Assets
                                       Current assets include all cash and other items expected to be converted into cash within the
                                       next 12 months, including the following:
                                        Cash and equivalents include cash and short-term safe investments, such as money market

                                        Accounts receivable include amounts due from customers for goods delivered or services
                                          rendered, reduced by the allowance for bad debts.
                                        Inventory is the cost of raw materials, work in process, and finished goods ready for sale.
                                        Prepaid expenses are items that a company has already paid for but has not yet benefited
                                          from, such as prepaid advertising, rents, insurance, and operating supplies.


                                       Fixed Assets
                                       Fixed assets are property, plant, and equipment. Unlike current assets, they are not easily
                                       converted into cash. Fixed assets, such as factories, have limited useful lives because wear and
                                       tear eventually reduce their value. For this reason, their cost can be depreciated over time and
                                       deducted from taxable income in annual installments to compensate for loss in value. They
                                       are shown at original cost less the accumulated depreciation. This value may be more, less, or
                                       about the same as the current market value.

                                    Other Assets
                                    Intangible assets are nonphysical properties, such as formulas, brand names, contract rights,
                                    and trademarks. Goodwill, also an intangible asset, reflects the corporation’s reputation and
                                    relationship with its clients. The value of these assets may be written down against income
                                    through a process known as amortization (very similar to depreciation).

                                               TAKE NOTE
                                               Although intangible assets may have great value to the corporation owning them, they
                                               generally carry little value to other entities.


                                    Liabilities
                                    Total liabilities on a balance sheet represent all financial claims by creditors against the
                                    corporation’s assets. Balance sheets usually include two main types of liabilities: current
                                    liabilities and long-term liabilities.                                                                         Unit 7

                                    Current Liabilities
                                    Current liabilities are corporate debt obligations due for payment within the next 12
                                    months. These include the following:
                                     Accounts payable—amounts owed to suppliers of materials and other business costs
                                     Accrued wages payable—unpaid wages, salaries, commissions, and interest
                                     Current long-term debt—any portion of long-term debt due within 12 months
                                     Notes payable—the balance due on equipment purchased on credit or cash borrowed
                                     Accrued taxes—unpaid federal, state, and local taxes

                                               TAKE NOTE
                                               In Unit 20, we will discuss the various financial statement ratios. At this time, we do
                                               want to define one term related to our current topic. A corporation’s working capital is
                                               the difference between its current assets and its current liabilities. Hopefully, that is a
                                               positive number.


                                    Long-Term Liabilities
                                    Long-term debts are financial obligations due for payment more than 12 months in the
                                    future. Examples would include bonds and mortgages.

                                               TAKE NOTE
                                               Long-term debts include mortgages on real property, long-term promissory notes, and
                                               outstanding corporate bonds.


                                               TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                               Under current accounting practice, deferred tax credits are treated as a liability.

                                         Shareholder Equity
                                         Shareholder equity, also called net worth or owners’ equity, is the stockholder claims on a
                                         company’s assets after all of its creditors have been paid. Shareholder equity equals total assets
                                         less total liabilities. On a balance sheet, three types of shareholder equity are identified: capital
                                         stock at par, capital in excess of par, and retained earnings.


                                         Capital Stock at Par
                                         Capital stock includes preferred and common stock, listed at par value. Par value is
                                         the dollar value per share assigned when a corporation’s owners (the stockholders) first
                                         contributed capital. Par value of common stock is an arbitrary value with no relationship to
                                         market price. As you saw in Unit 1, it plays an important role with preferred stock.

                                    Capital in Excess of Par
                                    Capital in excess of par, often called additional paid-in capital, capital surplus, or paid-in
                                    surplus, is the amount of money over par value that a company received when issuing its
                                    common stock. For example, if the par value was $1 per share and the stock was issued at $5
                                    per share, there is a paid-in surplus of $4 per share.


                                    Retained Earnings
                                    Retained earnings, sometimes called earned surplus or accumulated earnings, are profits
                                    that have not been paid out in dividends. Retained earnings represent the total of all earnings
                                    held since the corporation was formed, less dividends paid to stockholders. Operating losses
                                    in any year reduce the retained earnings from prior years.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              Treasury stock is stock that has been issued and then reacquired by the issuing                   Unit 7
                                              corporation. Those shares are no longer considered outstanding in the hands of the
                                              public because they are, so to speak, held in the corporation’s “treasury.” When a
                                              company has done this, the cost of those reacquired shares is shown in the owner’s
                                              equity portion of the balance sheet as a negative number. This has the effect of
                                              reducing the company’s net worth.


                                    Capital Structure
                                    A company’s capitalization is the combined sum of its long-term debt and equity securities.
                                    The capital structure is the relative amounts of debt and equity that compose a company’s
                                    capitalization. Some companies finance their businesses with a large proportion of borrowed
                                    funds; others finance growth with retained earnings from normal operations and little or no
                                    debt.

                                    Looking at the balance sheet, a corporation builds its capital structure with equity and debt
                                    including the following four elements:
                                     Long-term debt
                                     Capital stock (common and preferred)
                                     Capital in excess of par
                                     Retained earnings (earned surplus)

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              (See the following table for reference and explanation of the following terms.) The total
                                              capitalization on the sample balance sheet is $90 million ($50 million in long-term

                                       LO 7.b Identify the effects on the balance sheet from certain
                                       corporate actions.

                                       If a company changes its capitalization by issuing stock or bonds, the effects will show up on
                                       the balance sheet.


                                       Issuing Securities
                                       The example balance sheet indicates the company issued 1 million shares of $1 par common
                                       stock. If it issues another 1 million shares, the net worth (shareholders’ equity) will increase by
                                       the additional capital raised, and the amount of cash on the asset side of the balance sheet will
                                       increase.


                                       Convertible Securities
                                       When an investor converts a convertible debt security into shares of common stock, the
                                       amount of liabilities decreases, and the owners’ equity increases. The changes are on the same
                                       side of the balance sheet, so there is no change to the assets.


                                       Bond Redemption
                                       When bonds are redeemed—that is, the debt is repaid—liabilities on the balance sheet are
                                       reduced. The offsetting change would be a decrease in cash on the asset side of the balance
                                       sheet. The company would have less debt outstanding, but it would also have less cash. The
                                       balance sheet balances. Therefore, because the current asset (cash) was used to redeem the
                                       long-term liability (bond), working capital is reduced. However, because there would no
                                       longer be semiannual interest payments due on the debt, the future effect of the retirement of
                                       the bonds would be to increase the company’s cash flow.


                                       Dividends
                                       When a cash dividend on the company’s stock is declared, retained earnings are lowered
                                       and current liabilities are increased. The declaration of a cash dividend establishes a current
                                       liability until it is paid. Once paid, it reduces cash in current assets and also reduces current
                                       liabilities.

                                    Stock Splits
                                    A stock split does not affect shareholders’ equity. On the balance sheet, only the par value per
                                    share and number of shares outstanding change.


                                    Financial Leverage
                                    Financial leverage is a company’s ability to use long-term debt to increase its return
                                    on equity. A company with a high ratio of long-term debt to equity is said to be highly
                                    leveraged.

                                    Stockholders benefit from leverage if the return on borrowed money exceeds the debt service
                                    costs. But leverage is risky because excessive increases in debt raise the possibility of default in
                                    a business downturn.

                                    In general, industrial companies with debt-to-equity ratios of 50% or higher are considered
                                    highly leveraged. However, utilities, with their relatively stable earnings and cash flows, can be           Unit 7
                                    more highly leveraged without subjecting stockholders to undue risk. If a company is highly
                                    leveraged, it is also affected more by changes in interest rates.

                                               PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   As a result of corporate transactions, a company’s assets remain the same and its
                                                   owners’ equity decreases. Which of the following statements is true?
                                                    A. Prepaid expenses decrease.
                                                    B. Total liabilities increase.
                                                    C. Accrued expenses decrease.
                                                    D. Net worth increases.
                                                   Answer: B. Sometimes questions are best answered by analyzing the question
                                                   before we even look at the answer choices. We are told in the question that assets
                                                   have remained the same, but somehow the net worth (owners’ equity) has gone
                                                   down. If the balance sheet formula is Assets − Liabilities = Net worth, then somehow
                                                   the liabilities must have increased. That seems to make choice B a straightforward
                                                   answer, but let’s just check the others to be sure. Prepaid expenses are an asset—it
                                                   can’t be choice A, because we know assets haven’t changed. Choice D is so simple
                                                   that students sometimes choose it because they think there is a “trick” somewhere.
                                                   No trick here—if owners’ equity goes down, that is the net worth, so we can’t choose
                                                   “net worth increases.” Finally, accrued expenses are a liability, so if they decrease, net
                                                   worth goes up, not down. If you take these questions step by step, they tend to be
                                                   very logical.


                                               PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   Which of the following corporate actions will lead to an increase in a company’s
                                                   owners’ equity?
                                                    A. Issuing $10 million of 6% $100 par preferred stock
                                                    B. Issuing $10 million of 4% debentures
                                                    C. Payment of a cash dividend to common shareholders
                                                    D. Redemption of outstanding debt securities at a price in excess of par value
                                                   Answer: A. Stock represents equity in a corporation; issuing additional stock is a
                                                   straightforward method of increasing net worth (owners’ equity). Issuing a debt
                                                   security brings in cash, but that is offset by the new debt. Payment of a cash dividend
                                                   reduces cash on hand but reduces the declared dividend current liability by an equal
                                                   amount. Eliminating debt is good but, when done so at a price in excess of the par
                                                   value results, is a decrease to owners’ equity.

                                                    The balance sheet reports what resources (assets) a company owns and how it
                                                    has funded them. How the firm has financed the assets is revealed by the capital
                                                    structure—for example, long-term debt and owners’ equity (preferred stock, common
                                                    stock, and retained earnings).


                                       LO 7.c Recognize income statement items.


                                       Income Statement
                                       The income statement, sometimes referred to as the profit and loss or P&L statement,
                                       summarizes a company’s revenues (sales) and expenses for a fiscal period, usually quarterly,
                                       year to date, or the full year. It compares revenue against costs and expenses during the period.
                                       Fundamental analysts use the income statement to judge the efficiency and profitability of a
                                       company’s operation. Just as with the balance sheet, technical analysts generally ignore this
                                       information—it is not relevant to their charting schemes.


                                       Components of the Income Statement
                                       The various operating and nonoperating expenses on the income statement are discussed below.

                                       Revenues indicate the firm’s total sales during the period (the money that came in).

                                       The cost of goods sold (COGS) is the costs of labor, material, and production (including
                                       depreciation on assets employed in production) used to create finished goods. Subtracting
                                       COGS from revenues shows the gross operating profit or gross margin. This gross margin is
                                       usually divided by the net sales or revenues and is shown as a percentage, sometimes referred
                                       to as the margin of profit. Pre-tax margin is determined by subtracting COGS and other
                                       operating costs (rent and utilities) from sales to arrive at net operating profit. The resulting
                                       figure is earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).

                                       Interest payments on a corporation’s debt are not considered an operating expense. However,
                                       interest payments reduce the corporation’s taxable income. Pre-tax income, the amount of
                                       taxable income, is operating income less interest payment expenses.

                                       If dividends are paid to stockholders, they are paid out of net income after taxes have been
                                       paid. After dividends have been paid, the remaining income is added to retained earnings and
                                       is available to invest in the business.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    Please note the three terms above that we have put in boldface for you. Revenue (or
                                                    sales), cost of goods sold, and pre-tax income are the three primary components of
                                                    an income statement.
                                                    Think of it simply like this: the income statement shows (1) what came in, (2) what
                                                    went out, and (3) how much is left (before taxes).

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    Interest payments reduce a corporation’s taxable income, whereas dividend payments
                                                    to stockholders are paid from after-tax dollars. Because they are taxable as income to
                                                    stockholders, dividends are taxed twice, whereas interest payments are taxed once as
                                                    income to the recipient.

                                    Accounting for Depreciation
                                    As mentioned earlier when reviewing the balance sheet, fixed assets are shown at their cost
                                    minus accumulated depreciation. For these assets, which wear out over a period of time, tax
                                    law requires that the loss of value be deducted over the asset’s useful life, longer for some
                                    assets and shorter for others (you won’t have to know depreciation schedules). On the income
                                    statement, the allowable portion for the year is shown as an expense and, for our purposes,
                                    will generally be part of COGS. Remember, if the company uses accelerated depreciation, the
                                    expenses will be higher in the early years, resulting in lower pre-tax income (and lower income
                                    taxes) but higher income later on.


                                    Fiscal Year Accounting
                                    Many business entities prefer to end their accounting year on a date other than December 31
                                    (calendar-year accounting). Any 12-month period used by a business that ends other than on
                                                                                                                                          Unit 7
                                    December 31 is known as a fiscal year (the term fiscal is generally defined as something that
                                    pertains to financial matters). This term will be used many times when referring to required
                                    filings by investment advisers.

                                    In addition to the information thus far presented, there are two additional accounting
                                    concepts you may be required to understand.


                                    Audited vs. Unaudited Financial Statements
                                    Businesses must know their financial position at all times. With today’s technologies, it is
                                    much easier than only a few decades ago, when all bookkeeping was done manually. It is rare
                                    to find a business that does not produce financial information at least monthly, and many do
                                    so even more frequently. These financial reports are generally done by in-house staff and, even
                                    when done by an outside accounting firm, they are considered unaudited. That is, specific care
                                    has not been taken to examine every item. For normal operating purposes, these unaudited
                                    statements do the job. However, for formal reporting to the SEC (or other regulators) and
                                    to shareholders, an audited report is required. In an audited report, an independent (and
                                    independence is critical) auditor, most commonly a representative (or in the case of a large
                                    entity, a number of representatives) of a CPA firm, spends many hours poring over the books
                                    and records to verify and count everything.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    GAAP means “generally accepted accounting principles.” That is the standard used for
                                                    audited financial reports.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    Part of the audit is the auditor’s opinion. The best is an unqualified opinion. That
                                                    means the auditor has no qualms about certifying the audit. On the other hand, a
                                                    qualified opinion means the auditor has some reservations about the accuracy or
                                                    completeness of the information contained in the report.


                                       Cash vs. Accrual Accounting
                                       Smaller business enterprises tend to use the cash method of accounting, while larger ones base
                                       their financial reporting on the accrual method. How do these two methods differ? Primarily,
                                       it is the timing of when revenue and expenses are recognized. In the cash method, everything
                                       is “as received,” while in the accrual it is when “booked.” Let’s look at an example.

                                                    EXAMPLE
                                                    ABC Comfort Systems sells home heating and air conditioning systems. They install
                                                    a system in a home for $3,000 in May and, because they offer “90 days same as cash”
                                                    terms, they receive the payment in August. Under the cash method, the $3,000 would
                                                    not be entered on their books until actually received in August. Under the accrual
                                                    method, the $3,000 would be recorded when the sale took place in May.


                                       Footnotes
                                       Footnotes to the financial statements identify significant financial and management issues
                                       that may affect the company’s overall performance, such as accounting methods used,
                                       extraordinary items, accounting for inventory (FIFO or LIFO), pending litigation, and
                                       management philosophy.

                                       Typically, a company separately discloses details about its long-term debt in the footnotes.
                                       These disclosures are useful for determining the timing and amount of future cash outflows.
                                       The disclosures usually include a discussion of the nature of the liabilities, maturity dates,
                                       stated and effective interest rates, call provisions and conversion privileges, restrictions
                                       imposed by creditors, assets pledged as security, and the amount of debt maturing in each of
                                       the next five years.

                                       Also disclosed in the footnotes would be off-the-books financing arrangements such as debt
                                       guarantees.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    Footnotes are generally found on the bottom of the financial statements and can be

             LESSON 7.2: CASH FLOW ACCOUNTING

                                    LO 7.d Identify the use of the statement of cash flows.

                                    The cash flow statement reports a business’s sources and uses of cash and the beginning and ending
                                    values for cash and cash equivalents each year. There are three components generating cash flow:
                                     operating activities;
                                     investing activities; and
                                     financing activities.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              Most financial professionals add revenues and expenses that do not involve cash
                                              inflows or outflows (e.g., cost allocations such as depreciation and amortization) back
                                              to the company’s net income to determine the cash flow. As described previously, the
                                              cash flow statement will also reflect money from operations, financing, and investing,
                                              but not accounting changes.

                                       Cash Flow from Operating Activities
                                       Operating activities (all transactions and events that normally enter into the determination of
                                       operating income) include cash receipts (money coming in) from selling goods or providing
                                       services, as well as income from items such as interest and dividends. Operating activities also
                                       include cash payments (money going out), such as cost of inventory, payroll, taxes, interest,
                                       utilities, and rent. The net amount of cash provided (or used) by operating activities is the key
                                       figure on a statement of cash flows. Even though it would seem that interest and dividends
                                       would belong in investing activities, the accounting gurus put them here.

                                                    EXAMPLE
                                                    Sometimes using some numbers makes this concept much easier. If you take a look at
                                                    the income statement we reviewed a few pages ago, you will see that this company’s
                                                    net income (bottom line, to use the vernacular) was $2,250,000. Among the $6 million
                                                    in expenses deducted from the total revenues was $500,000 of depreciation. However,
                                                    the company never “wrote a check” for that money; it is the amount of the original
                                                    cost that it is allowed to write off as an expense each year as the fixed assets wear out.
                                                    So, not only does the company have the net income remaining after all expenses and
                                                    taxes, but it actually had another $500,000 in funds it could use, giving the company a
                                                    total cash flow of $2,750,000.


                                       Cash Flow from Investing Activities
                                       Investing activities include transactions and events involving the purchase and sale of
                                       securities, land, buildings, equipment, and other assets not generally held for resale as a
                                       product of the business. It also covers the making and collecting of loans. Investing activities
                                       are not classified as operating activities because they have an indirect relationship to the
                                       central, ongoing operation of the business (usually the sale of goods or services).


                                       Cash Flow from Financing Activities
                                       All financing activities deal with the flow of cash to or from the business owners (equity
                                       financing) and creditors (debt financing). For example, cash proceeds from issuing stock or
                                       bonds would be classified under financing activities. Likewise, payments to repurchase stock
                                       (Treasury stock) or to retire bonds and the payment of dividends are financing activities as
                                       well.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    Cash flow from operations will primarily use items from the income statement, while
                                                    cash flow from financing activities will use balance sheet items. Make sure you know
                                                    which one the question is asking about. For example, liquidating an outstanding bond
                                                    issue (paying off the debt) will have a profound impact on cash flow, and that uses
                                                    information from the balance sheet (cash for the payoff, and no more debt remaining)

             LESSON 7.3: SEC REPORTING
                                    LO 7.e Distinguish between the different forms used in SEC reporting.

                                    As we will learn in the next unit, in many cases, a security must be registered with the
                                    Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before being offered to the public. The
                                    registration rules are found in the Securities Act of 1933. Once registered, publicly traded
                                    corporations are required to periodically report to the SEC as specified in the Securities                Unit 7
                                    Exchange Act of 1934. One of the best sources of financial information is found in the reports
                                    required to be filed with the SEC by publicly traded companies. This information is available
                                    online at the SEC’s website. The location is at EDGAR, which stands for Electronic Data
                                    Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval of SEC filings. Among those filings, there are generally
                                    three that are used by fundamental analysts.


                                    Form 8-K
                                    This form is used to report newsworthy events to the SEC, thereby making them available to
                                    the public. Included are items such as change in management, change in the company’s name,
                                    mergers or acquisitions, bankruptcy filings, and major new product introductions or sale of
                                    a product line. A Form 8-K even has to be filed when a member of the board of directors
                                    resigns over a disagreement. The 8-K is filed within four business days of the occurrence.
                                    This form is used only by domestic issuers; foreign issuers are exempt. Although ADRs are
                                    registered with the SEC, they too are exempt because the underlying security is a foreign issue.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              One thing that would not trigger a Form 8-K is the relocation of a wholly owned
                                              subsidiary. However, sale of that subsidiary would require a filing and that, like any
                                              other Form 8-K filing, must be done within four business days of the event.


                                    Form 10-K
                                    Most domestic public issuers must file an annual report to the SEC on Form 10-K. This
                                    report is a comprehensive overview of the company’s business and financial condition and
                                    includes financial statements that have been audited by an independent accountant. Do not
                                    confuse this with the annual report to shareholders, which also contains an audited statement.
                                    The Form 10-K will generally contain more detailed financial information than the annual
                                    report, while the annual report will have much more detail about the company itself and its
                                    future plans. The filing deadlines depend upon the company’s public float and are not testable
                                    information.

                                       Form 10-Q
                                       Because one year between filings is a long time and a lot can happen quickly, we also have
                                       Form 10-Q, which is filed quarterly (Q for quarterly). It contains unaudited financial
                                       statements, and it must be filed after each of the first three fiscal quarters of the year (no
                                       10-Q is filed at the end of the fourth quarter—that information is taken care of by the filing
                                       of the 10-K).


                                       Annual Reports
                                       When it comes to publicly traded companies, in general, all shareholders must receive a copy
                                       of the issuer’s annual report. For those too lazy to access EDGAR, this is the most detailed
                                       information they can get on the company’s financial position. Unlike the Form 10-K, this
                                       is usually a professionally prepared piece that is just as much used for marketing purposes
                                       as it is for providing information. There is usually a welcoming letter from the CEO and/or
                                       Chairman of the Board, and it is generally loaded with beautiful pictures of smiling people
                                       (employees and customers) and the company’s facilities. New plans for products and programs
                                       are discussed, and voting proxies are included.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    SEC rules state that a company may provide shareholders with a copy of the Form
                                                    10-K instead of sending an annual report.

                  measurement using that term. Sales (revenues)
                  are included in cash flow from operating
                  activities.

             INTRODUCTION
                                    Before we can get started teaching about the rules and regulations, there are a few things we
                                    need to know. Because so much of the course deals with laws and regulations, it is necessary to
                                    know what laws are involved. When it comes to regulation of securities on the federal level, it
                                    will be largely the Securities Act of 1933. On the state level, it will be the Uniform Securities
                                    Act. When it comes to the regulation of investment advisers, on the federal level, there is the
                                    Investment Advisers Act of 1940. On the state level, it is the Uniform Securities Act (USA).
                                    When it comes to broker-dealers and their agents, on the federal level, it is the Securities
                                    Exchange Act of 1934 and, once again, on the state level, the USA. This exam is the property
                                    of NASAA, the North American Securities Administrators Association, the group of state,
                                    provincial, and Mexican regulators. Although the exam will ask about state and federal law, if it
                                    doesn’t specify, the “default” choice is always state law. Let’s investigate that law a bit.

          152        Unit 8   Regulation of Securities and Their Issuers



          LESSON 8.1: WHAT ARE SECURITIES AND WHO ISSUES THEM?
                                       LO 8.a Identify instruments that are defined as securities under the
                                       Uniform Securities Act.


                                       The Uniform Securities Act of 1956 (USA)
                                       The USA is Model State Securities Legislation. With the enactment of numerous state
                                       securities laws, commonly referred to as blue-sky laws, the need for uniformity in securities
                                       laws among the states arose. In 1956, the original Uniform Securities Act was drafted as
                                       model legislation for the separate states to adopt. As model legislation, the USA is not actual
                                       legislation; the USA is a template or guide that each state uses in drafting its securities
                                       legislation. The securities laws of most states follow the USA very closely and, in many cases,
                                       almost exactly.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    The term state means any of the 50 states; any territory or possession of the United
                                                    States (such as American Samoa, Guam, and the Virgin Islands); the District of
                                                    Columbia; and Puerto Rico.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    The exam will test your knowledge of the Uniform Securities Act, not the specifics
                                                    of your state’s securities legislation. The USA is periodically updated to adjust to
                                                    developments in the securities markets through the passage of Model Rules. You will
                                                    be tested on the 1956 version of the USA used by the North American Securities
                                                    Administrators Association (NASAA), the advisory body of state securities
                                                    regulators responsible for the content of the exam. The exam requires that you not
                                                    only know what the USA says but also are able to apply the law to concrete situations.
                                                    General knowledge of the law is not enough to pass the exam; you will be asked to
                                                    apply the law to situations that may arise in the course of business.


                                       Definition: Administrator. Possibly the most used term in the exam is Administrator. Who
                                       or what is this? Although some states may use other terms to describe this position, the exam
                                       will only use the word Administrator to refer to the office or agency that has the complete
                                       responsibility for administering the securities laws of the state. Therefore, the Administrator
                                       has jurisdiction over almost all securities activity that emanates from his state as well as that
                                       received in his state. The Administrator has jurisdiction over the registration of securities
                                       professionals and securities. She has the power to make rules and issue orders. She can deny,
                                       suspend, or revoke registrations. Yes, there are some limitations on the Administrator’s powers
                                       (and those will be covered in this course), but overall, this is one very powerful person.

                                       There are two other terms that will be covered in great detail in following units, but, in the
                                       event you are not familiar with them, we’ll define broker-dealer and agent.

                                       Broker-dealers (BDs) are in the business of buying and selling securities for their customers
                                       (investors) and for their own accounts. Agents, commonly referred to as registered
                                       representatives or the old-fashioned term, stockbrokers, are the individuals who represent
                                       broker-dealers in dealing with customers. The BDs are the entity the agents work for. In
                                       Unit 11, you’ll get the entire story.

                                                                                    Unit 8   Regulation of Securities and Their Issuers   153


                                    This unit discusses the procedures for the registration of securities as well as their exemptions
                                    from registration. For a securities transaction to be lawful under the Uniform Securities
                                    Act (USA), the security itself must be registered unless it or the transaction is exempt from
                                    registration requirements. In addition, we’ll also review some of the SEC’s regulations dealing
                                    with this subject as found in the Securities Act of 1933.

                                    Perhaps the most important term in the USA is the term security. Why is it so important?
                                    The reason is simple: the USA applies only to those financial instruments that are securities.
                                    The purchase, sale, or issuance of anything that is not a security is not covered by the act. The
                                    definition of a security, however, is complex. Over the years, courts have determined case by
                                    case what constitutes a security. The U.S. Supreme Court, in the Howey decision, defined
                                    the primary characteristics of what constitutes a security by concluding that an investment
                                    contract is a security. For an instrument to be a security, the court held, it must constitute
                                    (1) an investment of money (2) in a common enterprise, (3) with the expectation of profits,
                                    (4) to be derived primarily from the efforts of a person other than the investor. A common
                                    enterprise means an enterprise in which the fortunes of the investor are interwoven with
                                    those of the person offering the investment, a third party, or other investors.

                                    The USA provides a comprehensive list of more than a dozen financial instruments (many
                                    of which you’ve never heard of ) that are securities under the act and therefore covered by
                                    its provisions. Rather than waste your time with the list (we’ve included it after the Practice
                                    Question), please focus on the six items that are not securities and you’ll get any question you
                                    are given correct. The following six items are not securities under the act:
                                     An insurance or endowment policy or annuity contract under which an insurance
                                       company promises to pay a fixed sum of money either in a lump sum or periodically
                                       (this is basically any product from a life insurance company that does not use the word
                                       “variable”)                                                                                                Unit 8
                                     Interest in a retirement plan, such as an IRA or 401(k) plan
                                     Collectibles
                                     Commodities such as precious metals and grains, including futures and forward contracts
                                     Condominiums used as a personal residence
                                     Currency

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              The exam will want you to know what is and what is not a security. We suggest that
                                              you concentrate on learning the six that are not securities because they are much
                                              easier to remember, and you will still be able to answer the questions correctly. Let’s
                                              try a question so that you can see what we mean.


                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   Which list of instruments below is not composed of securities?
                                                    A. Stock, treasury stock, rights, warrants, and transferable shares
                                                    B. Voting trust certificates and interests in oil and gas drilling programs
                                                    C. Commodity futures contracts and fixed payment life insurance contracts
                                                    D. Options on securities and interests in multilevel distributorship arrangements
                                                   Answer: C. Commodity futures contracts and fixed payment life insurance contracts
                                                   are included in our list of six items that are not securities.

                                                           D. An investment contract
                                                          Answer: D. An investment contract is defined as a security under the Uniform
                                                          Securities Act. In fact, the term is often used as a synonym for a security. A
                                                          guaranteed, lump-sum payment to a beneficiary is an endowment policy excluded
                                                          from the definition of a security. Fixed, guaranteed payments made for life or for a
                                                          specified period are fixed annuity contracts not defined as securities. Commodity
                                                          futures contracts and the commodities themselves are not securities. It is much
                                                          easier to remember what is not a security than what is.


                                       Securities Under the Uniform Securities Act
                                       The USA does not define the term securities but provides a comprehensive list of financial
                                       instruments that are securities under the act and, therefore, are covered by its provisions.
                                       Under the Uniform Securities Act, among the many items included in the definition of
                                       security are any:
                                        stock;
                                        bond;
                                        debenture;
                                        evidence of indebtedness, such as a promissory note;
                                        collateral trust certificate;
                                        preorganization certificate or subscription;
                                        investment contract;
                                        voting trust certificate;
                                        certificate of deposit for a security (ADRs, not a bank CD);
                                        certificate of interest or participation in an oil, gas, or mining title or lease, or in payments
                                         out of production under such a title or lease;
                                        put, call, straddle, or other option trading on an exchange or OTC;
                                        any interest or instrument commonly known as a security; or
                                        warrant or right to subscribe to or purchase any of the above.


                                       Nonsecurity Investments
                                       Although collectibles, fixed annuities, precious metals, grains, real estate, and currencies can
                                       be attractive investments, they are not securities. Because these items are not securities, their
                                       sale is not regulated by state securities law. Furthermore, if a registered agent commits fraud
                                       in the sale of any of these items, he has not committed a violation of any state securities law.
                                       He has violated the antifraud provisions of another act prohibiting fraudulent commercial
                                       transactions.

                                    An individual’s direct ownership of an automobile is not a security—it is just ownership of a
                                    car. However, if that individual makes an investment of money in the stock of an automobile
                                    manufacturer with the expectation of making money due to the efforts of the company’s
                                    management skill, he has purchased a security. In the same manner, if a condominium is
                                    purchased in a resort area with the goal of placing it into a rental pool and renting it out
                                    most of the year, and it is used only for personal vacation time, the condo is considered a
                                    security because there is a profit motive, typically reliant on the efforts of a third party—the
                                    rental agent. On the other hand, if the individual has chosen to live in the condominium as a
                                    personal residence, it is a home, not a security.

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              Annuities with fixed payouts are not securities, but variable annuities are because they
                                              are dependent on the investment performance of securities within the annuity.




                                    LO 8.b Identify those who issue securities.


                                    Issuer
                                    An issuer is any person who issues (distributes) or proposes to issue a security. The most
                                    common issuers of securities are companies or governments (federal, state, and municipal
                                    governments and their agencies and subdivisions).

                                                                                                                                                    Unit 8
                                    If an issuer is nonexempt (not exempt from registering its securities) it must generally register
                                    its securities in the states where they will be sold under one of the registration methods
                                    described in this unit.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              This is very strange wording, but it might well appear on your exam. Under the
                                              Uniform Securities Act, with respect to certificates of interest; participation in oil, gas,
                                              or mining titles or leases; or in payments out of production under such titles or leases,
                                              there is not considered to be any issuer.


                                    Issuer Transaction
                                    An issuer transaction is one in which the proceeds of the sale go to the issuer. All newly issued
                                    securities, such as an initial public offering (IPO), are issuer transactions. In other words,
                                    when a company raises money by selling (issuing) securities to investors, the proceeds from
                                    the sale go to the company itself.

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              State X issues bonds as a way of borrowing money so that the state government can
                                              function. The state is the issuer of those bonds. Typically, they will be purchased by a
                                              client of a broker-dealer whose account is handled by an agent of the firm. This would
                                              be an issuer transaction because the proceeds of the sale of the bonds would go to
                                              State X, the issuer.

                                       Nonissuer Transaction
                                       A nonissuer transaction is one in which the proceeds of the sales do not go, directly or
                                       indirectly, to the entity that originally offered the securities to the public. The most common
                                       instance of this is everyday trading on exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange or
                                       Nasdaq. In a nonissuer transaction, the proceeds of the sale go to the investor who sold the
                                       shares. Because the shares are not new, we refer to this as secondary trading.

                                                    EXAMPLE
                                                    Using our previous example, if the investor who purchased those State X bonds
                                                    decided to sell them, she would contact her agent at the brokerage firm where she
                                                    has an account. The agent would then arrange for a sale to an interested buyer. In
                                                    this case, because the proceeds of the bond sale would go to the investor, this is a
                                                    nonissuer transaction, or secondary transaction (like when you sell your old car, it
                                                    is a second-hand sale: the manufacturer received the money when the product was
                                                    initially sold [primary] and you receive the money now [secondary]).


                                       Initial or Primary Offering
                                       An issuer transaction involving new securities is called a primary offering. If it is the first
                                       time an issuer distributes securities to the public, it is called an initial public offering (IPO).
                                       All primary offerings are issuer transactions because the issuer (the company) receives the
                                       proceeds from the investor investing in the company.

                                                    EXAMPLE
                                                    The first time that ABC Shoe Co. issued shares to the public, ABC Shoe engaged in an
                                                    IPO or an initial primary offering because it received the proceeds from distributing its
                                                    shares to the public. After ABC Shoe went public, subsequent transactions between
                                                    investors through agents of broker-dealers were nonissuer (secondary) transactions.

                                       Can an issuer have more than one primary offering? Yes, it happens with mutual funds every
                                       day. As you learned in Unit 3, open-end investment companies are constantly issuing new
                                       shares. They have a primary every day. However, they, like any other issuer, can only have one
                                       IPO. Whenever a corporation wishes to raise additional equity capital, it can issue additional
                                       new shares. These shares generally come from the authorized but unissued shares. There
                                       are several terms used for these additional primary offerings, such as follow-on offering or
                                       additional primary offering (APO).
                                       The easiest way to identify a primary offering is to “follow the money.” If the funds wind up
                                       in the coffers of the issuer, it is probably a primary offering or a primary distribution.

             LESSON 8.2: EXEMPT SECURITIES UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAW
                                    LO 8.c Recognize the securities exempt from registration under the
                                    Uniform Securities Act and the Securities Act of 1933.

                                    Later in this unit we are going to cover the registration of securities. Before doing that, it
                                    is important to learn that not all securities must register. Some, primarily because of the
                                    nature of the issuer, are granted an exemption from registration. Those are known as exempt
                                    securities. Those are the subject of this lesson. In other cases, the nature of the way in which
                                    the security is bought or sold results in an exemption from registration. We call those exempt
                                    transactions, and they are the subject of the next lesson.


                                    Exemptions from Registration Under the Uniform Securities Act
                                    Under the Uniform Securities Act, the exemptions discussed in this LO refer to an exemption
                                    from the act’s registration and sales literature filing requirements. In certain situations, the
                                    USA exempts both securities and transactions. A security, a transaction, or both can be
                                    exempt.

                                    An exempt security retains its exemption when initially issued and in subsequent trading.
                                    However, justification as an exempt transaction must be established before each transaction.

                                    The USA provides for a number of categories of exempt securities and even more categories of
                                    exempt transactions. Those securities that are nonexempt must register unless sold in exempt
                                    transactions. A special category of securities, federal covered securities (discussed later in this
                                    LO), do not register with the Administrator but may, especially in the case of investment                      Unit 8
                                    companies, have to file notice with the Administrator. As mentioned above, an exempt
                                    security retains its exemption at its initial issue and in subsequent trading.

                                    An exemption for a transaction, on the other hand, must be established with each transaction.
                                    Provided it is in the public interest, the state Administrator can deny, suspend, or revoke any
                                    securities transaction exemption other than that of a federal covered security. This action may
                                    be taken with or without prior notice (summarily).

                                               TAKE NOTE
                                               A security is exempt because of the nature of the issuer, not the purchaser.


                                    Exempt securities under the Uniform Securities Act include the following:
                                     U.S. and Canadian government and municipal securities. These include securities
                                       issued, insured, or guaranteed by the United States or Canada, by a state or province, or
                                       by their political subdivisions, (states or provinces, cities, counties, etc.).
                                     Foreign government securities. These include securities issued, insured, or guaranteed
                                       by a foreign government with which the United States maintains diplomatic relations.
                                       However, unlike U.S. or Canadian issues, political subdivisions are not included (unless
                                       guaranteed by the sovereign government).
                                     Depository institutions. These include securities that are issued, guaranteed by, or
                                       are a direct obligation of a depository institution. The USA divides them into the
                                       following categories: (1) any security issued by and representing an interest in or a debt
                                       of, or guaranteed by, any bank organized under the laws of the United States, or any
                                       bank, savings institution, or trust company organized and supervised under the laws

                                             of any state;* (2) any security issued by and representing an interest in or a debt of, or
                                             guaranteed by, any federal savings and loan association, or any building and loan or
                                             similar association organized under the laws of any state and authorized to do business
                                             in this state; and (3) any security issued or guaranteed by any federal credit union or any
                                             credit union, industrial loan association, or similar association organized and supervised
                                             under the laws of this state. Please note that for categories (2) and (3), if the institution is
                                             not federally chartered, then it must be authorized to do business in the state (under the
                                             supervision of a regulator in that state).
                                        Insurance company securities. These include securities issued, insured, or guaranteed
                                          by an insurance company authorized to do business in the state. Insurance company
                                          securities refer to the stocks or bonds issued by insurance companies, not the variable life
                                          policies and variable annuities sold by the companies.
                                        Public utility and common carrier securities. These include any security issued or
                                          guaranteed by a public utility or public utility holding company, or an equipment trust
                                          certificate issued by a railroad or other common carrier regulated in respect to rates by
                                          federal or state authority; or regulated in respect to issuance or guarantee of the security by
                                          a governmental authority of the United States, any state, Canada, or any Canadian province.
                                        Securities issued by nonprofit organizations. These include securities issued by
                                          religious, educational, fraternal, charitable, social, athletic, reformatory, or trade
                                          associations. “Nonprofit” is the key word.
                                        Securities of employee benefit plans. This includes any investment contract issued by an
                                          employee stock purchase, savings, pension, or profit-sharing plan.
                                        Certain money market instruments. Commercial paper and banker’s acceptances are the
                                          two most common examples.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    The five items listed with an asterisk (*) are the only cases where an individual
                                                    representing the issuer in the sale of its securities is excluded from the definition of an
                                                    agent. This concept will be explained in LO 11.d.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    A promissory note (commercial paper) that matures within nine months, is issued in
                                                    denominations of at least $50,000, and receives one of the three highest ratings by a
                                                    nationally recognized rating agency is exempt from registration requirements. Please
                                                    note that this is the only case where a security’s rating is part of the registration or
                                                    exemption under the Uniform Securities Act.


                                       Exemption for Federal Covered Securities
                                       The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996 (NSMIA) brought two significant
                                       changes to the industry. The first was the creation of the federal covered security. We’ll get
                                       to that in a moment. The other part of the law effectively divided the responsibility for
                                       regulating investment advisers between the states and the SEC by creating the category of
                                       registration known as a federal covered adviser. We’ll get into that in the next unit.

                                       Of importance to this unit is the term federal covered security, a security that is exempt from
                                       registration on the state level. State securities registration requirements were preempted with
                                       respect to federal covered securities. However, states may require notice filings, consisting
                                       of filing fees and copies of documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission
                                       (SEC), primarily in the case of registered investment companies (e.g., mutual funds).

                                                                                   Unit 8   Regulation of Securities and Their Issuers   159


                                    The major categories of federal covered securities (as defined in the NSMIA), which therefore
                                    cannot be regulated by state securities Administrators (except for violating antifraud
                                    provisions), include:
                                     securities issued by an open-end or closed-end investment company, unit investment
                                       trust, or face-amount certificate company that is registered under the Investment
                                       Company Act of 1940;
                                     securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the NYSE American LLC (formerly
                                       known as the American Stock Exchange [AMEX]), the Nasdaq Stock Market, and (not
                                       tested) several other U.S. exchanges. In addition, any security equal in seniority (rights
                                       or warrants) or senior to these securities (bonds and preferred stock) is also considered
                                       federal covered;
                                     securities offered pursuant to the provisions of Rule 506(b) or 506(c) of Regulation
                                       D under the Securities Act of 1933 (qualifying under the private placement transaction
                                       exemption); and
                                     most securities exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (you do not
                                       have to know the exceptions other than the one we’re going to describe below). If the
                                       federal government says the security does not have to register, no state can overstep that.
                                       Municipal bonds are included in the list of securities exempt from registration under
                                       federal (and state) law. However, under the NSMIA, if the municipal issuer is located in
                                       the state in which the securities are being offered, that security is not considered a federal
                                       covered security.

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              A bond issued by the city of Columbus, OH, is a federal covered security everywhere
                                              but in the state of Ohio. The effect of this is that no state regulator can enforce any            Unit 8
                                              of their rules against the bond. But, in the state of Ohio, even though the security is
                                              exempt under Ohio’s securities laws, the Administrator could request that the issuer
                                              (the city) furnish certain details about the issue. This Columbus, OH, bond is still
                                              exempt from registration under both state and federal law, but, in Ohio, it is not known
                                              as a federal covered security (everywhere else, it is).

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              It is important to note that registering a security with the SEC does not automatically
                                              make it federal covered. Yes, that is true of investment companies and those securities
                                              listed on certain stock exchanges and the Nasdaq Stock Market, but there are tens of
                                              thousands of stocks registered with the SEC that trade in the over-the-counter market
                                              (e.g., OTC Markets Group), and they are not federal covered. Furthermore, a security
                                              does not have to be registered with the SEC to be included in the definition of federal
                                              covered security. For example, U.S. government and municipal securities are exempt
                                              from registration with the SEC and are included in NSMIA’s list of federal covered
                                              securities.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              Although investment company securities such as mutual funds are federal covered
                                              securities, the Uniform Securities Act allows states to impose filing fees on them under
                                              a process called notice filing, as described in LO 8.g.

                                                          securities.


                                       Exempted Securities Under the Securities Act of 1933
                                       The exemptions under federal law are similar to those under state law, but there are some
                                       significant differences. As a NASAA exam, the exam will focus on the state laws, but you
                                       should be familiar with the federal ones as well.

                                       The Securities Act of 1933 makes it unlawful to sell or deliver a security through any
                                       instrument of interstate commerce unless a registration statement is in effect. However,
                                       certain securities are exempted from the registration requirements of the act. The following
                                       issues qualify as exempted securities:
                                        Any security issued or guaranteed by the United States, any state, or any political
                                          subdivision of a state (all federal government issues and municipal securities are exempted
                                          securities). Note that Canadian securities are not included in this exemption (NASAA
                                          membership includes Canadian Administrators)
                                        Any commercial paper that has a maturity at the time of issuance of no more than nine
                                          months (270 days), with the stipulation that the proceeds are to be used by the issuer to
                                          increase working capital and not for the purchase of fixed assets; there is no minimum
                                          denomination or rating requirement similar to that found in the Uniform Securities Act
                                        Any security issued by a person organized and operated exclusively for religious,
                                          educational, benevolent, fraternal, or charitable purposes and not for pecuniary profit
                                        Any interest in a railroad equipment trust (for purposes of the law, interest in a railroad
                                          equipment trust means any interest in an equipment trust, lease, or other similar
                                          arrangement entered into, guaranteed by, or for the benefit of a regulated common carrier
                                          to finance the acquisition of rolling stock, including motive power)
                                        Any security issued by a federal or state bank, savings and loan association, building and
                                          loan association, or similar institution

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    The exemption described for banks does not apply to bank holding companies. Most
                                                    of the large U.S. banks today are owned by holding companies.


                                       Rule 147 Exemption
                                       Any security issued under this rule qualifies as an exempt security under federal law but is not
                                       exempt under the Uniform Securities Act and will probably have to register with the state.

                                    This exemption from federal registration applies to any security offered and sold only to
                                    persons resident within a single state, where the issuer of such security is a person whose
                                    principal place of business is located within such state. Principal place of business means the
                                    location from which the officers, partners, or managers of the issuer primarily direct, control,
                                    and coordinate the activities of the issuer.

                                    The Rule 147 exemption is available only if the entire issue is offered and sold exclusively
                                    to residents of a single state. If any sales take place to nonresidents, the entire issue loses its
                                    exemption. The purpose of this exemption is to allow issuers to raise money on a local basis,
                                    provided the business is operating primarily within that state. The following conditions must
                                    be met in order to have a distribution qualify as an intrastate offering exempt from federal
                                    registration:
                                     The securities must be offered or sold exclusively to persons who have their principal
                                       residence within the state where the issuer’s principal place of business is located.
                                     For six months from the date of the sale by the issuer to that purchaser, resales of any part
                                       of the issue by that person will be made only to persons resident within the same state.
                                     The issuer must have a “reasonable belief ” that the investor is a resident of the state.
                                     It is required that issuers obtain a written representation from each purchaser as to
                                       residency.
                                     The issuer must place a prominent legend on the certificate disclosing to offerees and
                                       investors the limits on resales, among other things.
                                     A minimum of one of the following conditions must be met:
                                       –– At least 80% of the issuer’s gross revenue must be derived from operations within the

                                                                                                                                                  Unit 8
                                          state.
                                        –– At least 80% of the proceeds of the offering must be used for business purposes
                                           within the state.
                                        –– At least 80% of the issuer’s assets must be located within the state.
                                        –– A majority of the issuer’s employees must be located in the state.


                                    Rule 147A
                                    Rule 147A has the same requirements as the Rule 147 exemption, except
                                     Issuers may be incorporated or organized outside of the state in which they make the
                                       offering under Rule 147A, provided their principal place of business is in the state (for
                                       example, the corporation could be incorporated in Delaware but have its principal place
                                       of business in Idaho); and
                                     Issuers relying on Rule 147A may make offers available to out-of-state residents such as
                                       general solicitation or general advertising on the internet or other means, so long as sales
                                       are made only to in-state residents, while Amended Rule 147 requires that issuers make
                                       offers and sales only to in-state residents.

                                               EXAMPLE
                                               So, to summarize, here are the most testable changes:
                                                The “residency” rule for issuers only requires one of the three 80% conditions or
                                                  the fourth—a majority of the employees are located in the state.
                                                The resale restriction is six months from the date of purchase by the investor.

                                                     The rules refer to the term “principal place of business” to mean the location from
                                                       which the officers, partners, or managers of the issuer primarily direct, control,
                                                       and coordinate the activities of the issuer. This must always be in the state.
                                                     Only Rule 147A permits an issuer to be incorporated in a state other than the
                                                       state of residency—e.g., be incorporated in State A and have its principal place of
                                                       business in State B.

                                                       still required to be in-state residents.

                                                          Both Rule 147 and Rule 147A require that the issuer meet residency requirements.

                                                               purposes within the state.

             LESSON 8.3: EXEMPT TRANSACTIONS UNDER STATE AND FEDERAL LAW
                                    LO 8.d Recall the exempt transactions under the Uniform Securities
                                    Act and the Securities Act of 1933.


                                    Exempt Transactions Under the Uniform Securities Act
                                    Before a security can be sold in a state, it must be registered unless exempt from registration
                                    or traded in an exempt transaction. This section covers exemptions for transactions that take
                                    place in a state.

                                    There are many different types of exempt transactions. We begin by focusing on those most
                                    likely to be on your exam and finish with several others.
                                     Isolated nonissuer transactions. Isolated nonissuer transactions include secondary
                                       (nonissuer) transactions that occur infrequently (very few transactions per year; the exact
                                       number varies by state). However, these usually do not involve securities professionals. In
                                       the same manner that individuals placing a “for sale by owner” sign on their front lawns
                                       do not need a real estate license, one individual selling stock to another in a one-on-one
                                       transaction is engaging in a transaction exempt from the oversight of the Administrator,
                                       because the issuer is not receiving any of the proceeds, and the parties involved are not
                                       trading as part of a regular practice.
                                     Unsolicited brokerage transactions. These include transactions initiated by the
                                       client, not the agent. This is probably the most common of the exempt transactions.

                                                                                                                                                 Unit 8
                                       If a client calls a registered agent and requests that the agent buy or sell a security, the
                                       transaction is an unsolicited brokerage transaction exempt from state registration. But
                                       the Administrator may by rule require that the customer acknowledge upon a specified
                                       form that the sale was unsolicited, and that a signed copy of the form be kept by the
                                       broker-dealer for a specified period.
                                     Underwriter transactions. These include transactions between an issuer and
                                       broker-dealers performing in the capacity of an underwriter (such as a firm commitment
                                       underwriting) as well as those between underwriters themselves (as when functioning as
                                       members of a selling syndicate).
                                     Bankruptcy, guardian, or conservator transactions. Transactions by an executor,
                                       administrator, sheriff, marshal, receiver, guardian, or trustee in bankruptcy are exempt
                                       transactions. Please note that a custodian under UGMA or UTMA is not included in this
                                       list and that the only trustee is one in bankruptcy.
                                     Institutional investor transactions. These are primarily transactions with financial
                                       institutions such as banks, insurance companies, and investment companies, and there is
                                       no minimum order size used to define these trades.
                                     Limited offering transactions. These include any offering, called a private placement,
                                       directed at not more than 10 persons (called offerees) other than institutional investors
                                       during the previous 12 consecutive months, provided that
                                        –– the seller reasonably believes that all of the noninstitutional buyers are purchasing for
                                           investment purposes only,
                                        –– no commissions or other remuneration is paid for soliciting noninstitutional
                                           investors, and
                                        –– no general solicitation or advertising is used.

          164        Unit 8   Regulation of Securities and Their Issuers



                                             Unlike federal law, where the private placement rule restricts the number of purchasers,
                                             the USA restricts the number of offers that may be made.
                                             The number 10 is the figure that will be tested. But an Administrator may want to
                                             reduce it, for example, for uranium stocks or oil royalties, or increase it for a closely
                                             held corporation that wants to solicit 20 or 30 friends and relatives of the owners for
                                             additional capital. As we continue to learn, the Administrator has a great deal of power.
                                        Preorganization certificates. An offer or sale of a preorganization certificate or
                                          subscription is exempt if
                                             –– no commission or other remuneration is paid or given directly or indirectly for
                                                soliciting any subscriber,
                                             –– the number of subscribers does not exceed 10, and
                                             –– no payment is made by any subscriber.
                                             You have probably never heard of a preorganization certificate or subscription, so a little
                                             explanation is in order. A new corporation cannot receive a charter unless its documents
                                             of incorporation provide evidence that minimum funding is assured. Because the
                                             purpose of these preorganization certificates is to enable a new enterprise to obtain the
                                             minimum amount of capital required by the corporation law of the state, the USA places
                                             a limitation on the number of subscribers rather than the number of offerees (as in the
                                             private placement exemption above). Hence, there may be a publicly advertised offering
                                             of preorganization subscriptions. But there may be no payment until effective registration
                                             unless another exemption is available. This tool itself simply postpones registration; it
                                             does not excuse registration altogether.
                                        Transactions with existing security holders. A transaction made under an offer to
                                          existing security holders of the issuer (including persons who are holders of convertible
                                          securities, rights, or warrants) is exempt as long as no commission or other form of
                                          remuneration is paid directly or indirectly for soliciting that security holder.
                                        Nonissuer transactions by pledgees. A nonissuer transaction executed by a bona fide
                                          pledgee (i.e., the one who received the security as collateral for a loan), as long as it
                                          was not for the purpose of evading the act, is an exempt transaction. For example, you
                                          pledged stock as collateral for a loan and defaulted on your obligation. The lender will
                                          sell your stock to try to recoup his loss and, under the USA, this is considered an exempt
                                          transaction.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    Some students find it helpful to remember that an exempt security is a noun, while an
                                                    exempt transaction is a verb (hence the word “action”).


                                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                          Which of the following are exempt transactions?
                                                             I. A nonissuer transaction with a bank in a Nasdaq Capital Market Security
                                                            II. An unsolicited request from an existing client to purchase a nonexempt
                                                                security
                                                           III. The sale of an unregistered security in a private, nonpublicly advertised
                                                                transaction to 10 noninstitutional purchasers over a period not exceeding 12
                                                                months
                                                           IV. The sale of unlisted securities by a trustee in bankruptcy

                                                    A.   I and II
                                                    B.   I, II, and III
                                                    C.   I, II, and IV
                                                    D.   I, II, III, and IV
                                                   Answer: C. Choice III is not an exempt transaction because the private placement
                                                   exemption is limited to 10 offerees, not 10 purchasers. All of the others are included
                                                   in our list of exempt transactions.


                                    Try to follow this next point because it is a bit tricky. The Administrator may, by rule or order,
                                    deny or revoke the registration exemption of:
                                     any security issued by any person organized and operated not for private profit but
                                       exclusively for religious, educational, benevolent, charitable, fraternal, social, athletic, or
                                       reformatory purposes, or as a chamber of commerce or trade or professional association
                                       (your basic nonprofit exemption); and
                                     any investment contract issued in connection with an employees’ stock purchase, savings,
                                       pension, profit-sharing, or similar benefit plan.
                                    Please note that a few pages ago, we gave you a list of nine different exempt securities, from
                                    U.S. and Canadian government issues through certain money market instruments. However,
                                    the Administrator can only deny exemption to the two specified above. On the other hand,
                                    with the exception of those involving federal covered securities, the Administrator may
                                    deny any exempt transaction. That means that, for example, just because an agent solicited
                                    a transaction with an insurance company of a security that was not federal covered, the
                                    Administrator has the power, if he feels it is justified, to consider that transaction nonexempt.

                                    Under the USA, the burden of providing an exemption or an exception from a definition falls                    Unit 8
                                    upon the person claiming it.

                                               TAKE NOTE
                                               There are only two securities exemptions that the Administrator may revoke, while all
                                               exempt transactions, other than in certain federal covered securities, may be revoked.

                                    Before we summarize, let’s try a practice question:

                                               PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   Under the Uniform Securities Act, which of the following persons is responsible for
                                                   proving that a securities issue is exempt from registration?
                                                    A. Underwriter
                                                    B. The person requesting the exemption
                                                    C. State Administrator
                                                    D. There is no need to prove eligibility for an exemption.
                                                   Answer: B. The burden of proof for claiming eligibility for an exemption falls to the
                                                   person claiming the exemption. In the event the registration statement was filed by
                                                   someone other than the issuer (such as selling stockholders or a broker-dealer), that
                                                   person must prove the claim.


                                    An exempt transaction is exempt from the regulatory control of the state Administrator
                                    because of the manner in which a sale is made or because of the person to whom the sale is
                                    made. A transaction is an action and must be judged by the merits of each instance.

          166        Unit 8   Regulation of Securities and Their Issuers



                                                    EXAMPLE
                                                    An agent can sell a security that is not exempt from registration in the state if the
                                                    purchaser of the security is a bank or other institutional buyer. Why is that so? Because
                                                    the sale of securities to certain financial institutions is an exempt transaction (as will
                                                    be enumerated shortly), the sale can be made without registration. This means that
                                                    the securities sold in exempt transactions do not have to be registered in the state. If
                                                    that same nonexempt security was not sold in an exempt transaction, such as to an
                                                    individual investor, it would have to be registered in the state.


                                       Summary of Exemptions from Registration Under the Uniform
                                       Securities Act
                                       Let’s start our summary with a key statement from the USA:

                                       “It is unlawful for any person to offer or sell any security in this state unless (1) it is registered under
                                       this act or (2) the security or transaction is exempted under this act; or (3) it is a federal covered
                                       security.”
                                       We must point out that these exemptions apply to the security or transaction only, not to the
                                       securities professional. So, if a security is exempt, such as a government security, it can be sold
                                       in this state without any registration. But the person who sells it must be properly registered
                                       in this state (unless that person qualifies for an exemption). We’ll get into this in full detail in
                                       Unit 11.


                                       Exempt Transactions Under the Securities Act of 1933
                                       Unlike the USA, there are only two exempt transactions that might be tested, and they are:
                                        transactions by any person other than an issuer, underwriter, or dealer (basically private
                                          transactions between individuals); and
                                        transactions by an issuer that do not involve a public offering (private placement under
                                          Regulation D).

                                       In a major effort aimed at facilitating the capital formation needs of small businesses, the
                                       SEC adopted Regulation D, the private placement exempt transaction. Securities offered and
                                       sold in compliance with Regulation D are exempt from registration with the SEC and, as was
                                       listed earlier, are considered federal covered securities exempt from registration on the state
                                       level as well. Our primary concern is with SEC Rule 506, a private placement where there is
                                       no dollar limit on the amount sold.

                                       The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act, made several important
                                       changes to Rule 506 of Regulation D. Rule 506 consists of two sections, 506(b) and 506(c).
                                       A company seeking to raise capital through a private placement under Rule 506(b) can sell
                                       the offering to an unlimited number of accredited investors (defined below) and up to 35
                                       nonaccredited investors. In addition, no advertising may be done on behalf of the offering.

                                       On the other hand, Section 506(c) permits the offering to be advertised. There are two
                                       primary (and interrelated) requirements in order to do this.
                                        All purchasers are accredited investors, or the issuer reasonably believes that they are
                                          accredited investors.
                                        The issuer takes reasonable steps to verify that all purchasers are accredited investors,
                                          which could include reviewing documentation such as W-2s, tax returns, bank and
                                          brokerage statements, credit reports, and the like.

                                                                                   Unit 8   Regulation of Securities and Their Issuers   167


                                    An issuer can elect to make a typical Rule 506 offering without general solicitation or
                                    advertising under Section 506(b) in order to include up to 35 nonaccredited investors in the
                                    offering or to avoid the heightened verification procedures.

                                    The JOBS Act also included a provision that an issuer is disqualified from using Rule 506
                                    under their “bad actor” provisions. Simply put, if the issuer or other relevant persons (such as
                                    underwriters, directors, officers, or significant shareholders of the issuer) have been convicted
                                    of securities fraud or certain other securities violations, an offering under Rule 506 may not
                                    take place.


                                    SEC Rule 501 Accredited Investors
                                    SEC Rule 501 classifies an accredited investor for the purposes of Regulation D into several
                                    categories. Investors are considered to be accredited under the rule only if the issuer or any
                                    person acting on the issuer’s behalf has reasonable grounds to believe, and does believe after
                                    reasonable inquiry, that the investors are included in one of the categories in the definition.

                                    The separate categories of accredited investors under Regulation D include:
                                     a bank, an insurance company, or a registered investment company;
                                     an employee benefit plan if a bank, an insurance company, or a registered investment
                                       adviser makes the investment decisions, or if the plan has total assets in excess of
                                       $5 million;
                                     a charitable organization, corporation, LLC, or partnership with assets exceeding
                                       $5 million;

                                                                                                                                                 Unit 8
                                     directors, executive officers, and general partners of the issuer;
                                     any natural person whose individual net worth, or joint net worth with that person’s
                                       spouse or spousal equivalent, excluding the net equity in his primary residence, exceeds
                                       $1 million at the time of his purchase;
                                     any natural person who had an individual income in excess of $200,000 in each of the
                                       two most recent years or joint income with that person’s spouse or spousal equivalent in
                                       excess of $300,000 in each of those years and has a reasonable expectation of reaching the
                                       same income level in the current year;
                                     entities made up of accredited investors;
                                     individuals who are qualified as:
                                        –– licensed General Securities Representatives (Series 7),
                                        –– licensed Investment Adviser Representatives (Series 65*), and
                                        –– licensed Private Securities Offerings Representatives (Series 82).
                                        –– Please note that NASAA has stated “a person seeking accredited investor status by
                                           passing the Series 65 exam would also need to be licensed as an investment adviser
                                           representative in her state and would need to comply with all state-specific licensing
                                           requirements (e.g., paying dues, etc.).” So, it is more than just passing the exam.
                                           Regardless of the license, one must have met all of the licensing requirements.
                                     individual investors who are knowledgeable employees of private funds. This would
                                       include directors and certain executive officers of the private fund, or of an affiliated
                                       person of the private fund that manages the investment activities of the private fund.
                                       However, they are only accredited investors for the purpose of investing in offerings by
                                       the private fund and other private funds managed by their employer. They cannot use
                                       their status as a knowledgeable employee to qualify as an accredited investor to invest in
                                       other offerings.

                                        three categories of investment advisers:
                                          –– those registered with the SEC,
                                             –– those registered in any state, and
                                             –– exempt reporting advisers;
                                        limited liability companies (LLCs) with assets of more than $5 million; and
                                        almost any entity with investments of more than $5 million.
                                       The term accredited investor applies only to private placements. A favorite phrase of the
                                       regulators is “eligibility does not equal suitability.” Therefore, just because one meets the
                                       financial requirements of an accredited investor does not mean that suitability standards are
                                       ignored.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    Can assets in an account or property held jointly with another person who is not the

                                                    net worth test in Rule 501? Answer: Yes, assets in an account or property held jointly
                                                    with a person who is not the purchaser’s spouse may be included in the calculation
                                                    for the net worth test, but only to the extent of his or her percentage ownership of the
                                                    account or property.

                                       What is Form D, and when does it have to be filed? Under Rule 503 of Regulation D, an
                                       issuer that is issuing securities in reliance on Regulation D must file Form D electronically
                                       with the SEC no later than 15 days after the first sale of securities in the offering.

             LESSON 8.4: REGISTRATION OF SECURITIES UNDER FEDERAL LAW

                                    LO 8.e Recollect the procedures for registering nonexempt securities
                                    under the Securities Act of 1933.

                                    The Securities Act of 1933 (also called the Paper Act, the Truth in Securities Act, and the
                                    Prospectus Act) regulates the issuing of corporate securities sold to the public. Unless the
                                    security or transaction is exempt, the act requires securities issuers to make full disclosure of
                                    all material information in their registration materials in order for investors to make fully
                                    informed investment decisions.

                                    Just like the rules under state law, if the security is not exempt (a nonexempt security) or the
                                    transaction is not exempt (a nonexempt transaction), then the security must be registered with
                                    the SEC.

                                    Issuer information must be disclosed to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in a
                                    registration statement and published in a prospectus. In addition, the act prohibits fraudulent
                                    activity in connection with the sale, underwriting, and distribution of securities. The act
                                    provides for both civil and criminal penalties for violations of its provisions.

                                    Even though registration under the Uniform Securities Act (the law that deals with regulation
                                    by the states) will be covered directly after this, where appropriate, mention will be made of
                                    the similarities and differences between certain federal and state definitions.

                                    Definition: prospectus. A prospectus is any notice, circular, letter, or communication,
                                    written or broadcast by radio or television, that offers any security for sale or confirms the sale               Unit 8
                                    of a security. A tombstone advertisement (one that simply identifies the security, the price,
                                    and the underwriters) is not considered a prospectus nor an offering of the subject security.
                                    The term prospectus does not include oral communications.

                                    As mentioned earlier, an issuer is any person who issues or proposes to issue any security.
                                    Most issuers are businesses, and the term issuer would also apply to a government entity.

                                    When, in LO 11.d, we describe the exclusion from the definition of agent for an individual
                                    who represents the issuer in the sale of its security, we state that this is not the usual method
                                    of distributing a new issue, but it is used by small firms who wished to reduce the cost. In
                                    almost all cases, securities are distributed by a broker-dealer (or network of BDs) acting
                                    as underwriters of the issue. The term underwriter is defined as “any person, usually a
                                    broker-dealer, who has purchased a security from an issuer with a view to the distribution of
                                    the security, or participates or has a direct or indirect participation in that distribution.”

                                               TAKE NOTE
                                               The SEC does not approve securities registered with it, does not pass on the
                                               investment merit of any security, and never guarantees the accuracy of statements in
                                               the registration statement and prospectus.
                                               In its review process, the SEC merely attempts to make certain that all pertinent information
                                               is fully disclosed in the registration statement and prospectus by requiring that:
                                                the issuer file a registration statement with the SEC before securities are offered or
                                                  sold in interstate commerce;
                                                a prospectus that meets the requirements of the act be provided to prospective
                                                  buyers; and
                                                penalties (civil, criminal, or administrative) be imposed for violations of the act.

                                       The Registration Statement
                                       An issuer must file a registration statement with the SEC disclosing material information about
                                       the issue. The registration statement must be signed by the principal executive officer (usually
                                       designated the CEO), the principal financial officer (usually designated the CFO), and a
                                       majority of the board of directors.

                                       All of the signers are subject to criminal and civil penalties for willful omissions and
                                       misstatements of material facts. The information required in the registration statement may be
                                       summarized as follows:
                                        Purpose of issue
                                        Public offering price (anticipated range)

                                        Promotion expenses
                                        Expected use of the net proceeds of the issue to the company

                                        Earnings statements for the last three years

                                        Copy of underwriting agreements
                                        Copies of articles of incorporation


                                       The Cooling-Off Period
                                       After the issuer files a registration statement with the SEC, a 20-day cooling-off period
                                       begins. After the issuer (with the underwriter’s assistance) files with the SEC for registration
                                       of the securities, the cooling-off period begins before the registration becomes effective.
                                       The registration can become effective as early as 20 calendar days after the date the SEC has
                                       received it. In practice, however, the cooling-off period is seldom the minimum 20 days; the
                                       SEC usually takes longer to clear registration statements.

                                    Preliminary (Red Herring) Prospectus
                                    The preliminary prospectus must be made available to any prospective purchaser who
                                    expresses interest in the security from the time the issue is filed with the SEC until it becomes
                                    publicly available for sale, which is the effective date (the previously described cooling-off
                                    period).

                                    A red herring is used to acquaint investors with essential facts concerning the new issue. It is
                                    also used to solicit indications of buyer interest. However, it cannot be used:
                                     as a confirmation of sale;
                                     in place of a registration statement; or
                                     to declare the final public offering price.
                                    However, along with stating the expected number of shares to be sold, a bona fide estimate of
                                    the price range per share is required to be included.

                                    Under no circumstances may a broker-dealer or one of its agents accept money or orders
                                    prior to the effective date. All the agent can do is ask the client for a nonbinding indication of
                                    interest as to whether she might be interested in the security once the registration is declared
                                    effective.

                                    The term red herring was given to the preliminary prospectus because the front page contains
                                    the following statement printed in red ink:

                                    “A Registration Statement relating to these securities has been filed with the Securities and Exchange
                                    Commission but has not yet become effective. Information contained herein is subject to completion

                                                                                                                                                   Unit 8
                                    or amendment. These securities may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to the time
                                    the Registration Statement becomes effective.”

                                    No person connected with the offering is allowed to make marks on a preliminary prospectus
                                    under any circumstances. They cannot write short summaries or reviews on the preliminary
                                    prospectus. The preliminary prospectus must be given to customers without any alterations
                                    because, as stated above, information is subject to change.

                                               TAKE NOTE
                                               Two items missing from the preliminary prospectus (red herring) are the public
                                               offering price (expected range must be shown) and the effective date.


                                               TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                               During the cooling-off period, underwriters may not:
                                                take orders; or
                                                distribute sales literature or advertising material.
                                               However, they may:

                                                distribute preliminary prospectuses; or
                                                publish tombstone advertisements to provide information about the potential
                                                  availability of the securities.

                                       A registration statement is normally a very long and complex document for an investor
                                       to read. The act requires the preparation of a shorter document called a prospectus. The
                                       prospectus summarizes the information contained in the registration statement. It must
                                       contain all the material facts in the registration statement, but in shorter form. The prospectus
                                       must be given to every person who purchases no later than with confirmation of the sale. The
                                       purpose of a prospectus is to provide the investor with adequate information to analyze the
                                       investment merits of the security. Even if an investor does not intend to read a prospectus, it
                                       still must be given to him. It is unlawful for a company to sell securities before the effective
                                       date of the registration statement.


                                       Effective Date of the Registration Statement
                                       On the date a registration statement becomes effective, securities may be sold to the public by
                                       broker-dealers and their agents. A copy of the final (effective) prospectus must be delivered
                                       to each purchaser. This is normally accomplished by including the prospectus along with
                                       a confirmation of the trade, although it would certainly be permitted to deliver it earlier.
                                       Additional sales literature may be used by the firm as long as the sales literature is preceded
                                       or accompanied by a prospectus. Just as with a preliminary prospectus, no markings of any
                                       kind may be placed on the prospectus. No areas of special interest may be highlighted or have
                                       attention drawn to them by any other method. Money may be accepted by the broker-dealer
                                       from customers at this time.

             LESSON 8.5: REGISTRATION OF SECURITIES UNDER STATE LAW

                                    LO 8.f Recollect the procedures for registering nonexempt securities
                                    under the Uniform Securities Act.

                                    State law, under the Uniform Securities Act, requires disclosures similar to those under federal
                                    law. Depending on the nature of the issuer and/or the type of transaction, a security may
                                    or may not have to register under state and/or federal law. The following is a key statement
                                    regarding state law:

                                    Under the Uniform Securities Act, it is unlawful for any person to offer or sell an unregistered
                                    security in a state unless
                                    1. it is registered under the act;
                                    2. the security or transaction is exempted from registration under the act; or
                                    3. it is a federal covered security.

                                    If the security or transaction is not exempt or is not a federal covered security as defined by
                                    the National Securities Markets Improvement Act, it must be registered in the state, or it
                                    cannot be lawfully sold in the state.

                                    The first step in the registration procedure is for the issuer or its representative to complete
                                    a registration application and file it with the state securities Administrator. The person
                                    registering the securities is known as the registrant. There are some provisions applicable to all

                                                                                                                                                  Unit 8
                                    registrations regardless of the method used. The exam will want you to know these well.


                                    Filing the Registration Statement
                                    State Administrators require every issuer to supply the following information on their
                                    applications:
                                     Amount of securities to be issued in the state
                                     States in which the securities are to be offered, but not the amounts offered in those other
                                       states
                                     Any adverse order or judgment concerning the offering by regulatory authorities, court,
                                       or the SEC
                                     Anticipated effective date
                                     Anticipated use of the proceeds (why are we raising this money?)
                                    When filing the registration statement with the Administrator, an applicant may include
                                    documents that have been filed with the Administrator within the last five years, provided
                                    the information is current and accurate. The Administrator may, by rule or order, permit the
                                    omission of any information it considers unnecessary.

                                               TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                               Although most registration statements are filed by the issuer, the exam may require
                                               you to know that they may also be filed by any selling stockholder, such as an insider
                                               making a large block sale, or by a broker-dealer.

                                       Filing Fee
                                       The issuer (or any other person on whose behalf the offering is to be made) must pay a filing
                                       fee, as determined by the Administrator, when filing the registration. The filing fees are often
                                       based on a percentage of the total offering price.

                                       If the registration is withdrawn or if the Administrator issues a stop order before the
                                       registration is effective, the Administrator may retain a portion of the fee and refund the
                                       remainder to the applicant.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    A stop order is used to deny effectiveness to, or suspend or revoke the effectiveness
                                                    of, any registration statement. This applies only to securities, not professionals such as
                                                    broker-dealers, agents, investment advisers, and investment adviser representatives.


                                       Ongoing Reports
                                       The Administrator may require the person who filed the registration statement to file reports
                                       to keep the information contained in the registration statement current and to inform the
                                       Administrator of the progress of the offering.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    These reports cannot be required more often than quarterly.


                                       Special Subscription Form
                                       The Administrator may also require, as a condition of registration, that the issue be sold only
                                       on a form specified by the Administrator and that a copy of the form or subscription contract
                                       be filed with the Administrator or preserved for up to three years.



                                       LO 8.g Identify the methods of state registration of securities,
                                       including the antifraud provisions of the Uniform Securities Act.


                                       State Registration Methods
                                       The USA provides two methods for securities issuers to register their securities in a state, plus
                                       a special method for certain federal covered securities. They are:
                                        notice filing;
                                        coordination; and
                                        qualification.


                                       Registration by Notice Filing
                                       As previously mentioned, the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996
                                       (NSMIA) designated certain securities as federal covered and, therefore, removed from
                                       the jurisdiction of the state regulatory authorities. Although the states are preempted from
                                       requiring registration for federal covered securities, status as a federal covered security is not a
                                       preemption of the licensing or antifraud laws. Any person who sells a federal covered security

                                                                                    Unit 8   Regulation of Securities and Their Issuers   175


                                    must be licensed as a broker-dealer or agent (unless otherwise exempted) and must also
                                    comply with the antifraud provisions of state laws.

                                    The Uniform Securities Act gives the Administrator the authority to require notice filings with
                                    respect to federal covered securities, generally investment companies registered with the SEC
                                    under the Investment Company Act of 1940. So, what is this notice filing? Primarily, it is an
                                    opportunity for the states to collect revenue in the form of filing fees because, unlike with
                                    the two actual methods of registration we are going to discuss, the Administrator has limited
                                    powers to review any documentation filed with her department. The fees for notice filing are
                                    generally lower than for the two forms of registration.

                                    Under the notice filing procedure, state Administrators may require the issuer of certain
                                    federal covered securities to file the following documents as a condition for sale of their
                                    securities in the state:
                                     Documents filed along with their registration statements filed with the SEC
                                     Documents filed as amendments to the initial federal registration statement
                                     A report as to the value of such securities offered in the state
                                     Consent to service of process

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              Keep in mind the distinction between federal covered securities and SEC-registered
                                              securities. As stated earlier, SEC-registered does not mean federal covered. Many
                                              are and many aren’t, and federal covered also includes those exempt from SEC
                                              registration, such as Treasury and municipal securities.
                                                                                                                                                  Unit 8

                                              Before the initial offer of any federal covered security in a state, the Administrator,
                                              by rule or order, may require the filing of all documents that are part of a federal
                                              registration statement filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission under
                                              the Securities Act of 1933, together with a consent to service of process signed by
                                              the issuer. However, unless there is an appearance of fraud, the Administrator does
                                              not have the power (because of lack of jurisdiction) to prevent the sale of a federal
                                              covered security in his state.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              Even though an issuer of a federal covered security (think about a Fortune 500
                                              company listed on the NYSE) may not have to notice file, that does not mean that the
                                              company can make misrepresentations during an offer made in any state. To do so
                                              would violate the antifraud provisions of the USA.


                                    Registration by Coordination
                                    The most common form of registration for those securities that are not federal covered
                                    (typically securities traded on one of the facilities of the OTC Markets group such as the
                                    Pink Market) is coordination. A security may be registered by coordination if a registration
                                    statement has been filed under the Securities Act of 1933 in connection with the same
                                    offering.

                                       In coordinating a federal registration with state registration, issuers must supply the following
                                       records in addition to the consent to service of process:
                                        Copies of the latest form of the prospectus filed under the Securities Act of 1933, if the
                                          Administrator requires it
                                        A copy of articles of incorporation and bylaws, a copy of the underwriting agreement, or
                                          a specimen copy of the certificate
                                        If the Administrator requests, copies of any other information filed by the issuer under
                                          the Securities Act of 1933
                                        Each amendment to the federal prospectus promptly after it is filed with the SEC


                                       Effective Date
                                       Registration by coordination becomes effective at the same time the federal registration
                                       becomes effective, provided:
                                        no stop orders have been issued by the Administrator and no proceedings are pending
                                          against the issuer;
                                        the registration has been on file for at least the minimum number of days specified by
                                          the Administrator, a number that currently ranges from 10 to 20 days, depending on the
                                          state; and
                                        a statement of the maximum and minimum offering prices and underwriting discounts
                                          have been on file for two business days.

                                       Registration by coordination is by far the most frequently used method and, from a practical
                                       standpoint, is the only sensible way to register a multistate offering.


                                       Registration by Qualification
                                       Any security can be registered by qualification. Registration by qualification requires a
                                       registrant to supply any information required by the state securities Administrator. Securities
                                       not eligible for registration by another method must be registered by qualification. In general,
                                       securities that will be sold only in one state (intrastate) will be registered by qualification.
                                       To register by qualification, an issuer must supply a consent to service of process and the
                                       following information:
                                        Name, address, form of organization, description of property, and nature of business;
                                        Name and address of any person owning 10% or more of the outstanding shares of any
                                          class of equity security of the issuer;
                                        Estimated proceeds and the use to which the proceeds will be put;
                                        Type and amount of securities offered, offering price, and selling and underwriting costs;
                                        Copy of any prospectus, pamphlet, circular, or sales literature to be used in the offering;
                                          and
                                        A specimen copy of the security’s certificate.
                                       The Administrator may require additional information by rule or order. The Administrator
                                       may require that a prospectus be sent to purchasers before the sale and that newly established
                                       companies register their securities for the first time in a state by qualification.

                                               TAKE NOTE
                                               As we’ve noted previously, in order to register, even by notice filing, there must
                                               be a consent to service of process filed with the Administrator. However, a person
                                               (remember the broad definition) who has filed such a consent in connection with a
                                               previous registration or notice filing need not file another. A practical effect of this is if
                                               you leave the firm you are registering with (you’ve probably already filed the consent
                                               to service of process to get this far) and register with another firm, you do not have
                                               to file a new consent—the old one remains on file. Or, if a company decides to raise
                                               additional capital by issuing more stock, a new consent is not required.


                                    Effective Date
                                    Unlike coordination, where the effective date is triggered by SEC acceptance of the
                                    registration, a registration by qualification becomes effective whenever the state Administrator
                                    so orders.

                                    Regardless of the method used, every registration statement is effective for one year from its
                                    effective date. One interesting facet of the law is that the registration may continue in effect
                                    past the first anniversary if there are still some unsold shares remaining, as long as they are still
                                    being offered at the original public offering price by either the issuer or the underwriter.

                                    Although the above rule applies to all methods of registration, as a practical matter, it
                                    would rarely apply other than in a security registered by qualification. Those registered by
                                    coordination are also obviously registered with the SEC and therefore are sold by the major
                                    investment banking houses. Unless the issue is a real dog, it will sell out rather quickly. Even
                                    those that are not popular are usually completely subscribed to in a week or two.
                                                                                                                                                       Unit 8
                                    On the other hand, what if the issue, regardless of the method of registration, is in very high
                                    demand? Is it possible to increase the number of shares in the offering without having to file
                                    a new registration statement? Yes. A registration statement may be amended after its effective
                                    date so as to increase the securities specified to be offered and sold if two conditions are met:
                                     The public offering price is not changed from the amount stated in the original
                                       registration statement; and
                                     The underwriters’ discounts and commissions are not changed from the respective
                                       amounts stated in the original registration statement.


                                    Escrow
                                    As a condition of registration under coordination or qualification, the Administrator may
                                    require that a security be placed in escrow if the security is issued:
                                     within the past three years;
                                     to a promoter at a price substantially different than the offering price; or
                                     to any person for a consideration other than cash.
                                    In addition, the Administrator may require that the proceeds from the sale of the registered
                                    security in this state be impounded until the issuer receives a specified amount from the
                                    sale of the security either in this state or elsewhere. There have been many instances where
                                    companies were unable to raise their targeted goal and just took the money and ran. This
                                    impound, or escrow, lessens the likelihood that this will happen.

                                                    A registration statement may be amended after its effective date to change the number
                                                    of shares to be offered and sold if the public offering price and underwriter’s discounts
                                                    and commissions are unchanged.

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTIONS
                                                    1.    KAPCO Dividend Yield Fund, a closed-end investment company registered under the
                                                          Investment Company Act of 1940, wishes to commence offering its shares in States A,
                                                          B, C, and D. It could be required to
                                                            A. coordinate its federal registration with each of the four states.
                                                            B. notice file.
                                                            C. register by qualification in each of the states.
                                                            D. do none of these, because investment companies registered under the
                                                                 Investment Company Act of 1940 are federal covered securities and are
                                                                 exempt from registration.
                                                          Answer: B. Although these are federal covered securities and exempt from
                                                          traditional registration, as a registered investment company, you can expect that it
                                                          will be required to engage in a notice filing.
                                                    2.    Registration is effective when ordered by the Administrator in the case of registration

                                                          Answer: D. Registration by qualification is the only registration method where
                                                          the Administrator sets the effective date. The effective date under registration
                                                          by coordination is set by the SEC, and notice filing is merely the filing of certain
                                                          documents by certain federal covered securities.

                                                          effective for
                                                            A. a period determined by the Administrator for each issue.

                                                            C. 1 year from the date of issue.
                                                            D. 1 year from the previous January 1.
                                                          Answer: B. On the state level, securities registration statements are generally
                                                          effective for 1 year from the effective date. However, the effective date may be
                                                          extended for a longer period during which the security is being offered or distributed
                                                          in a nonexempt transaction by the issuer or other person on whose behalf the
                                                          offering is being made or by any underwriter who is still offering part of an unsold
                                                          allotment or subscription taken by him as a participant in the distribution.


                                       Antifraud Provisions of the Uniform Securities Act
                                       Under all regulatory bodies, in order for an action to be fraudulent, it must be committed
                                       willfully and knowingly. There is no such thing as “accidental” fraud. Although the SEC has
                                       antifraud statues as well, the exam will focus on those of the Uniform Securities Act. The
                                       applicability of the antifraud provisions is almost universal. For example, here is a statement
                                       about investment advisers:

                                       “It is unlawful for any person who receives, directly or indirectly, any consideration from another
                                       person for advising the other person as to the value of securities or their purchase or sale, whether

                                                                                      Unit 8   Regulation of Securities and Their Issuers   179


                                    through the issuance of analyses or reports or otherwise, (1) to employ any device, scheme, or artifice
                                    to defraud the other person, (2) to engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates
                                    or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the other person”;

                                    and for broker-dealers:

                                    “It is unlawful for any person, in connection with the offer, sale or purchase of any security, directly
                                    or indirectly (1) to employ any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud, (2) to make any untrue
                                    statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
                                    statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, or
                                    (3) to engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud
                                    or deceit upon any person”;

                                    and for securities:

                                    “The antifraud provisions apply regardless of whether the security is registered, exempted, or sold in
                                    violation of the registration requirements.”

                                    What these statements indicate that that no securities professional and no security is exempt
                                    from the antifraud rules. But what if the person is excluded from the definition of, say, an
                                    investment adviser? Or what if the investment is excluded from the definition of a security?
                                    What then?

                                    The distinction between exemptions and exceptions (or exclusions) from definitions is
                                    important in view of the fact that an exempt security is not exempt from the antifraud
                                    provisions of the Uniform Securities Act.

                                    As we covered earlier in this unit, the typical life insurance policy or fixed annuity is not a
                                    security and is not covered under the antifraud statutes of the Uniform Securities Act. On                      Unit 8
                                    the other hand, we know that securities issued by insurance companies are exempted from
                                    registration under the conditions of the act. Even though these securities are exempt from
                                    registration and the filing of advertising and sales literature with the Administrator, they are
                                    still subject to the antifraud provisions. Therefore, one could be charged with fraudulent
                                    behavior in the sale of stock in an insurance company (or any other exempt security).
                                    In the next unit, we will learn about investment advisers, including those who are excluded
                                    from the definition. As an example, one of the exclusions applies to engineers whose
                                    advice is incidental to their profession. Could that engineer ever be charged with violating
                                    the antifraud provisions regarding investment advice? Yes! Just because a person is not an
                                    investment adviser doesn’t mean that fraudulent advice can be given. Using the same logic, a
                                    federal covered investment adviser, although not registered in any state, can be charged by the
                                    state Administrator when there is an alleged violation of the antifraud provisions of the USA.

                                    Is there ever a time when the antifraud provisions do not apply? Yes. They do not apply to
                                    an investment that is excluded from the definition of a security. An example of this would
                                    be a rare coin dealer who falsifies the dates on coins sold to a client. That certainly is fraud,
                                    but it doesn’t come under the USA’s antifraud provisions because rare coins are not securities.
                                    Another example is the sale of a fixed annuity—it is not a security, so the antifraud provisions
                                    of the Uniform Securities Act do not apply. Of course, the state insurance department would
                                    have something to say about any fraudulent activity with insurance products, but if they were
                                    not securities, the USA provisions don’t apply.

             INTRODUCTION
                                    State securities Administrators regulate persons engaged in securities transactions that occur in
                                    their states similarly to the way they regulate the securities involved in those transactions.

                                    Investment advisers are defined by federal and state securities laws. A person that performs
                                    the functions of an investment adviser, as the term is defined in the Uniform Securities Act
                                    or the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and more fully described in SEC Release IA-1092,
                                    is by definition an investment adviser. Investment advisers must conduct business within the
                                    regulatory framework prescribed in federal and state securities laws. Investment advisers are
                                    represented by individuals known as investment adviser representatives (IARs). This exam
                                    qualifies you for that role. There is more information about IARs in Unit 10.

          LESSON 9.1: WHO IS AN INVESTMENT ADVISER?
                                       LO 9.a Define investment adviser, including the impact of SEC Release
                                       IA-1092 on the definition of investment advisers and their activities.

                                       The definition of investment adviser (IA) is virtually identical under state law (the Uniform
                                       Securities Act) and federal law (the Investment Advisers Act of 1940). Here is how it is
                                       worded in the Uniform Securities Act:

                                       “Investment adviser means any person who, for compensation, engages in the business of advising
                                       others, either directly or through publications or writings, as to the value of securities or as to the
                                       advisability of investing in, purchasing, or selling securities, or who, for compensation and as a part
                                       of a regular business, issues or promulgates analyses or reports concerning securities.”

                                       Definition: person. As defined in the Uniform Securities Act, “‘Person’ means an individual
                                       (a natural person) a corporation, a partnership, an association, a joint-stock company, a
                                       trust where the interests of the beneficiaries are evidenced by a security, an unincorporated
                                       organization, a government, or a political subdivision of a government.” For test purposes, it
                                       is easiest to remember the three nonpersons. They are (1) a minor, (2) a deceased individual,
                                       and (3) an individual declared mentally incompetent by the courts.

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                         A person is basically anyone that can open an account. The test would be looking for
                                                         you to choose an answer to a question such as this:
                                                         Which of the following is included in the definition of a person?
                                                          A. A minor
                                                          B. The National Hockey League
                                                          C. A deceased person
                                                          D. A person whom the courts have declared to be mentally incompetent
                                                         Answer: B. Odd to think of the NHL as a person, but they would be included in the
                                                         USA’s definition. That is why such questions are much easier if you just remember the
                                                         three nonpersons.


                                       The definition of investment adviser is sometimes referred to as the “three prong test.” That is,
                                       as long as the person involved:
                                       1. gives advice to others on securities;
                                       2. does so as part of a regular business activity; and
                                       3. receives compensation for performing this activity.

                                       Let’s examine each of those.


                                       Giving Advice to Others on Securities
                                       Persons will meet the first prong of the test if they provide advice to others about specific securities,
                                       such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or limited partnerships, as well how to allocate assets among
                                       a group of securities. Even indirect advice can be included. Examples of this could be:
                                        “Why should you invest in securities as compared to nonsecurities investments, such as
                                          insured bank CDs or rental property?” or
                                        “Here is our view on future stock market trends.”

                                         Unit 9    Regulation of Investment Advisers Including State-Registered and Federal Covered Advisers   185


                                    The advice can be in written or oral form; that is, it can be part of a printed (or online) report
                                    or advice given on a phone call. The regulators, both state and federal, have stated that advice
                                    on many other types of investments is not advice about securities. Some of the specifically
                                    mentioned nonsecurities investments include:
                                     commodities;
                                     collectibles, such as coins or stamps;
                                     precious metals, such as gold and silver; and
                                     real estate.

                                                  TAKE NOTE
                                                  The list of what is a security and what is not a security was covered in detail in Unit 8,
                                                  LO 1.a.


                                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                      A person giving advice on which of the following investments would be deemed to be
                                                      giving advice on securities?
                                                       A. Gold
                                                       B. Common stock
                                                       C. Rental real estate
                                                       D. Rare stamps
                                                      Answer: B. Common stock is a security; the others are considered nonsecurities.


                                    In the Business of Providing Advice
                                    A person is in the business of providing advice and meets the second prong defining one as an
                                    investment adviser if he:
                                     gives advice on a regular basis such that it constitutes a business activity conducted with
                                       some regularity. Although the frequency of the activity is a factor, it is not the only
                                       determinant in whether one is giving advice. Furthermore, providing advice does not have
                                       to be the person’s principal activity; and
                                     advertises investment advisory services and presents himself to the public as an investment
                                       adviser or as one who provides investment advice.
                                                                                                                                                       Unit 9

                                    Compensation
                                    A person who receives any economic benefit as a result of providing investment advice meets
                                    the third prong. Compensation includes advisory fees, commissions, or other types of fees
                                    relating to the service rendered and can be directly or indirectly paid.

                                                  EXAMPLE
                                                  When a person designs a comprehensive financial plan for an individual but does not
                                                  charge a fee for that design, electing to be compensated solely through commissions
                                                  received on the sale of insurance policies sold as part of the plan, that is considered
                                                  compensation. Even though that compensation is indirect, it meets the release’s
                                                  definition of compensation for investment advice.

                                       Investment Counsel
                                       One of the terms that may appear on the exam is investment counsel. Questions dealing with
                                       this topic require the student to know that there are two criteria specified in the Investment
                                       Advisers Act of 1940 that must be met in order to use the term to describe the nature of the
                                       IA’s business. They are as follows:
                                        The IA’s principal business must be giving investment advice. This basically excludes financial
                                          planners and others for whom investment advice is only a part of what they do.
                                        The IA must provide investment supervisory services. This one is a bit harder for most to
                                          understand, so here are some details as issued by the SEC:

                                       Continuous and Regular Supervisory or Management Services.

                                       General Criteria. You provide continuous and regular supervisory or management services with
                                       respect to an account if: (a) you have discretionary authority over and provide ongoing supervisory
                                       or management services with respect to the account; or (b) you do not have discretionary authority
                                       over the account, but you have ongoing responsibility to select or make recommendations, based
                                       upon the needs of the client, as to specific securities or other investments the account may purchase
                                       or sell and, if such recommendations are accepted by the client, you are responsible for arranging or
                                       effecting the purchase or sale.

                                       You do not provide continuous and regular supervisory or management services for an account
                                       if you: (a) provide market timing recommendations (i.e., to buy or sell), but have no ongoing
                                       management responsibilities; (b) provide only impersonal investment advice (e.g., market
                                       newsletters); (c) make an initial asset allocation, without continuous and regular monitoring and
                                       reallocation; or (d) provide advice on an intermittent or periodic basis (such as upon client request,
                                       in response to a market event), or on a specific date (e.g., the account is reviewed and adjusted
                                       quarterly).” 1

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                           Which of the following investment advisers would be permitted to use the term
                                                           investment counsel?
                                                             A. A Certified Financial Planner (CFP®), offering a wide range of services to her
                                                                 clients, including tax planning, estate planning, and insurance planning, as
                                                                 well as investment advice
                                                             B. A professional providing a market timing service with an annual subscription
                                                                 fee of $495 (this service attempts to maximize profits by suggesting entry and
                                                                 exit points for over 100 listed stocks)
                                                             C. A firm whose exclusive business is placing their client’s assets into model
                                                                 portfolios which are monitored on a daily basis
                                                             D. All of these
                                                           Answer: C. In order to use the term investment counsel, two criteria must be met—the
                                                           principal business must be giving investment advice, and the adviser must provide
                                                           investment supervisory services. Running model portfolios for clients with daily
                                                           monitoring would meet both requirements. The financial planner is not principally
                                                           in the business of offering investment advice, because she describes her service as
                                                           offering a wide range of services, of which advice is only one part. The exam frequently
                                                           uses that wording to indicate that advice is not the principal activity. While the market
                                                           timing publisher’s principal business activity may be offering advice, nothing about
                                                           the description indicates that individual client accounts are being monitored.

                                    SEC Release IA-1092
                                    As a result of the proliferation of persons offering investment advice in the 1980s, Congress
                                    directed the SEC to define the activities that would subject a person to the 1940 Investment
                                    Advisers Act. The SEC did so in SEC Release IA-1092 in October of 1987.

                                    SEC Release IA-1092 interprets the definition of investment adviser under the Investment
                                    Advisers Act of 1940 to include financial planners, pension consultants, and others who offer
                                    investment advice as part of their financial practices. Much of the Release was a repetition
                                    of existing law, such as the “three prongs.” The biggest impact was the expansion of the
                                    definition. Let’s look at those who are directly affected.


                                    Financial Planners
                                    Financial planners who make recommendations regarding a person’s financial resources or
                                    perform analyses that concern securities are investment advisers if such services are performed
                                    as part of a business and for compensation. Under this interpretation, the SEC holds that
                                    there is no such thing as a comprehensive financial plan that does not involve securities.


                                    Pension Consultants
                                    Consultants who advise employee benefit plans on how to fund their plans with securities
                                    are also considered investment advisers by the SEC. In addition, the SEC considers pension
                                    consultants who advise employee benefit plans on the selection, performance, and retention of
                                    investment managers to be investment advisers.


                                    Sports and Entertainment Representatives
                                    Persons who provide financially related services to entertainers and athletes that include advice
                                    related to investing, tax planning, budgeting, and money management are also investment
                                    advisers. As earnings for these celebrities continue to climb, more and more of them use
                                    personal managers to handle all of their finances, and those individuals or firms are generally
                                    going to be considered investment advisers.

                                                  TAKE NOTE
                                                  A sports agent who secures a favorable contract for a football player and receives a                Unit 9
                                                  commission of 10% of the player’s salary is not necessarily an investment adviser.
                                                  However, if the sports agent advises the football player to invest his money in
                                                  specific securities, the agent is then in the business of offering investment advice
                                                  and would then be subject to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 or the Uniform
                                                  Securities Act.

                                                    KNOWLEDGE CHECK 9.1
                                                    1.   Under SEC Release IA-1092, which of the following is most likely to meet the definition
                                                         of an investment adviser?
                                                          A. A person who sells long-term care insurance
                                                          B. A person who advises businesses on the best locations for their stores
                                                          C. A person who assists pension plans in the selection of portfolio managers
                                                          D. A person who manages portfolios of investment grade coins
                                                    2.   Under the Uniform Securities Act, the term person would not refer to which of the
                                                         following?
                                                           A. A deceased individual
                                                           B. A subdivision of a government
                                                           C. An unincorporated amateur athletic club
                                                           D. A nonprofit, charitable corporation


          LESSON 9.2: WHO IS NOT AN INVESTMENT ADVISER?
                                       LO 9.b Identify exclusions and exemptions under the Investment
                                       Advisers Act of 1940 and the Uniform Securities Act.

                                       Because terminology is critical to jurisdiction, it is important to know the difference between
                                       excluded from a definition and exempt from a provision.

                                       Exclusion means excluded from, or not included in, a definition. For example, if a person is
                                       excluded from the definition of an investment adviser, that person is not subject to provisions
                                       of state or federal law that refer to investment advisers.

                                       There are a number of exclusions from the investment adviser definition available to persons
                                       who might well satisfy all three prongs of the definition but, because of the provisions of the
                                       law, are specifically not defined as investment advisers. An excluded person is not subject
                                       to any provisions of the Investment Advisers Act or the Uniform Securities Act (other than
                                       antifraud statutes).

                                       Exemption means not being subject to the registration provisions of the acts even though
                                       that person meets the definition. For example, a person defined as an investment adviser can
                                       be exempt from state registration requirements as an investment adviser because that person
                                       enjoys an exemption from state registration under the Uniform Securities Act. An example
                                       we’ll cover shortly is the case of an investment adviser with no place of business in the state
                                       whose only clients in the state are institutions.

                                       Definition: federal covered investment adviser. The National Securities Markets
                                       Improvements Act of 1996 (discussed in LO 9.d) created the term federal covered investment
                                       adviser. These are investment advisers who are solely under federal jurisdiction and are
                                       specifically excluded from the definition of investment adviser in the Uniform Securities Act.
                                       Because they are not defined as investment advisers under state law, they do not register on
                                       the state level.

                                       A significant portion of the law (and the exam) deals with those who either are excluded from
                                       the definition or are investment advisers but exempt from registering as such. Let’s begin with
                                       those who are excluded from the definition.

                                    Exclusions
                                    Although the definition of an investment adviser is broad, certain exclusions apply. Under
                                    state law (the Uniform Securities Act), there are seven primary exclusions from the definition
                                    of an investment adviser.
                                    1. Any bank and bank holding company, savings institution, or trust company is excluded.
                                       This exclusion is generally limited to U.S. banks and bank holding companies. The
                                       exclusion is unavailable to credit unions and investment adviser subsidiaries of banks or
                                       bank holding companies.

                                        Definition: bank holding company. A holding company is organized to invest in and
                                        manage other corporations. Control can occur through the ownership of 50% or more of the
                                        voting rights or through the exercise of a dominant influence. It is sometimes referred to as the
                                        parent organization. A bank holding company is a holding company whose primary asset is a
                                        commercial bank. Most of the large U.S. banks today are owned by holding companies.
                                    2. Any lawyer, accountant, teacher, or engineer whose advice is solely incidental to the
                                       practice of their profession is excluded. This exclusion is not available to any of these who
                                       have established a separate advisory business. Also, the exclusion would not be available
                                       to any of these who hold themselves out as offering investment advice. We like to refer to
                                       this as the L.A.T.E. exclusion.

                                                  EXAMPLE
                                                  When referring to the L.A.T.E. exclusion, it is important to understand the meaning of
                                                  incidental. A lawyer advising clients to carefully invest a settlement from a legal case
                                                  is not giving investment advice unless charging a separate fee for helping set up the
                                                  portfolio. An accountant is not giving investment advice when suggesting to a wealthy
                                                  client that investing in tax-exempt municipal bonds might be a wise idea unless
                                                  charging a separate fee to help select the bonds.


                                    3. Any broker-dealer whose performance of such services is solely incidental to the conduct
                                       of its business as a broker-dealer and who receives no special compensation (such as
                                       when offering wrap fee programs) is excluded. The exclusion also applies to registered
                                       representatives (agents) of broker-dealers.

                                        Definition: wrap fee program. Any advisory program under which a specified fee or fees
                                                                                                                                                      Unit 9
                                        not based directly upon transactions in a client’s account is charged for investment advisory
                                        services (which may include portfolio management or advice concerning the selection of
                                        other investment advisers) and the execution of client transactions. The exclusion from the
                                        definition of investment adviser available under both state and federal law to broker-dealers
                                        is not in effect for those offering wrap fee programs. The exam may ask about these
                                        programs this way:

                                        Which two of the following are services provided in a wrap fee program? The correct
                                        choice would be investment advisory and brokerage execution (transactions) for a single
                                        “wrapped” fee. Don’t choose financial planning and recommendations.

                                                  TAKE NOTE
                                                  Special compensation for investment advice is compensation to the broker-dealer
                                                  or salesperson in excess of that which they would be paid for providing a brokerage
                                                  or dealer service alone. Consequently, special compensation exists where there is a
                                                  clearly definable charge for investment advice.

                                       4. Publishers may qualify for an exclusion from the definition, but they must meet certain
                                          criteria. Excluded from the definition of investment adviser would be a “publisher of any
                                          bona fide newspaper, news magazine, or business or financial publication of general and
                                          regular circulation.”2 To qualify for this exclusion, the publication must be (1) of a general
                                          and impersonal nature, in that the advice provided is not adapted to any specific portfolio
                                          or any client’s particular needs; (2) bona fide, or genuine, in that it contains disinterested
                                          commentary and analysis as opposed to promotional material; and (3) of general and
                                          regular circulation, in that it is not timed to specific market activity or events affecting,
                                          or having the ability to affect, the securities industry. For example, newspapers of general
                                          circulation would be eligible for the exclusion.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    An investment newsletter is being published for a subscription fee. Rather than being
                                                    published on a regular basis (weekly, monthly, quarterly, and so forth), issues are
                                                    released in response to market events. How do the laws view this publisher? If the
                                                    publication is issued from time to time in response to episodic market events, the
                                                    exclusion is lost.


                                       5. Certain individuals who are employed by investment advisers—investment adviser
                                          representatives (described in detail in Unit 10, LO 10.a)
                                       6. Any person who is a federal covered adviser is excluded from the definition.
                                       7. Any other person the Administrator specifies is excluded.

                                       The exclusions under federal law (the Investment Advisers Act of 1940) are almost the same,
                                       except for the final three above. Instead, the federal act excludes:

                                       “Any person whose advice, analyses, or reports are related only to securities that are direct obligations
                                       of, or obligations guaranteed by, the United States, or by certain U.S. government-sponsored
                                       corporations designated by the Secretary of the Treasury (e.g., FNMA, GNMA) is excluded.”

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    For purposes of the exclusion, under both state and federal law, the term bank does
                                                    not include a savings and loan association or a foreign bank, but it does include a
                                                    savings institution.

                                       Because understanding these exclusions is so important, let’s look at an example:

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                           The Uniform Securities Act excludes certain persons from the definition of an
                                                           investment adviser if their performance of advisory services is solely incidental to
                                                           their professions. This exclusion would apply to all of the following except
                                                             A. an accountant.
                                                             B. an economist.
                                                             C. an electrical engineer.
                                                             D. a college professor teaching a course on economics.
                                                           Answer: B. As long as the activity is incidental to the professional practice, and no
                                                           separate fee for the advice is charged, the act specifically excludes accountants, lawyers,
                                                           any professional engineer (aeronautical, civil, mechanical, or other), and teachers.
                                                           Economists are not included in this listing (most economists are not teachers).

                                         Unit 9    Regulation of Investment Advisers Including State-Registered and Federal Covered Advisers   191


                                    Exemptions
                                    When it comes to exemptions, state and federal laws have established rules whereby a person,
                                    although meeting the definition of an investment adviser, is not required to register as such.
                                    That person is considered to be exempt from registration. Because the state and federal
                                    exemptions are not as similar as the exclusions, let’s take them separately starting with the
                                    exemptions available under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (federal law).


                                    Federal Law Exemptions
                                    The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 exempts the following persons who, even though
                                    defined as investment advisers, are exempt from the registration requirements of the act.

                                    Intrastate advisers (only within one state). Investment advisers, other than an investment
                                    adviser who acts as an investment adviser to any private fund (defined at LO 3.d and again
                                    in LO 9.c), whose clients are residents of the state in which the adviser has its principal office
                                    and only place of business and who do not give advice dealing with securities listed on any
                                    national exchange (e.g., New York Stock Exchange), are exempt. For example, an adviser
                                    would be exempted under this provision if all of its clients were Georgia residents, its only
                                    places of business were in Georgia, and it did not give advice on securities listed on any
                                    national exchange.

                                    Advisers to insurance companies. Advisers whose only clients are insurance companies are
                                    exempt.

                                                  TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                  Please be careful on this one—the exam frequently asks if the exemption applies when
                                                  the only clients are banks. As we’ll learn shortly, that exemption applies under state
                                                  law, but not under federal law.


                                    State Law Exemptions
                                    In the same manner as the federal law, the Uniform Securities Act exempts from registration
                                    certain persons who, although they fall within the definition of an investment adviser, do not
                                    have to register as such in the state.

                                                                                                                                                      Unit 9
                                    Investment advisers exempt from registration with the state Administrator are those who
                                    have no place of business in the state but are registered in another state, provided their only
                                    clients in the state are:
                                     broker-dealers registered under the act;
                                     other investment advisers;
                                     institutional investors;
                                     existing clients who are not residents but are temporarily in the state;
                                     limited to five or fewer clients, other than those listed above, resident in the state during
                                       the preceding 12 months (called the de minimis exemption); or
                                     any others the Administrator exempts by rule or order.
                                    Definition: institution. The term institution would include banks, trust companies, savings
                                    and loan associations, insurance companies, investment companies (e.g., mutual funds),
                                    employee benefit plans with assets of not less than one million dollars ($1,000,000), and
                                    governmental agencies or instrumentalities. Institutions are included in the term person,




09_0-2532_LEM_65E_Unit09.indd 191                                                                                                               28/10/22 1:45 PM

                                       defined previously. The act generally affords less protection to institutional investors owing to
                                       their supposed greater investment sophistication.

                                       Definition: retail client. As you can tell by now, terminology is very important on this exam.
                                       A few questions use the term retail client instead of noninstitutional client. Look for it and
                                       remember that retail clients need far more protection than institutional ones. If the question
                                       refers to an individual, including a trust or an estate, that will always be a retail client.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    This exemption applies to investment advisers who are registered in at least one state
                                                    but have clients in another state where the investment adviser (IA) does not maintain a
                                                    place of business.

                                                    One of the bullet points above grants an exemption to those investment advisers
                                                    who have no place of business in the state but are licensed in a state where they have
                                                    a place of business and offer and sell securities in the state only with persons in the
                                                    state who are existing customers and who are not residents of the state but are just
                                                    there temporarily. This is sometimes referred to as the snowbird exemption because it
                                                    is frequently used to deal with existing clients who winter in warmer climates. There is
                                                    no time limit to define temporary (some people spend 3–4 months staying warm) but
                                                    if the client should change legal residence to that state, the investment adviser has
                                                    30 days to register in that state or discontinue doing business with that client (unless
                                                    qualifying for the de minimis exemption). It is similar to the common experience of
                                                    moving from one state to another. When you do that, you generally have 30 days to get
                                                    new license tags for your car and a new driver’s license.

                                                    Because these exemptions all apply when the investment adviser does not have a
                                                    place of business in the state it is relevant to understand that an investment adviser
                                                    or one of its representatives who advertises to the public, in any way, the availability
                                                    of meeting with prospective clients in a hotel, country club, seminar, or any other
                                                    location in the state is considered to have a place of business in the state. However,
                                                    an investment adviser or one of its representatives who contacts existing clients who
                                                    happen to be in the state and notifies them that he will be passing through the state
                                                    and will be available to meet with them in his hotel room, is not considered to have
                                                    a place of business in the state because the announcement is being made only to
                                                    existing clients and not to the public.

                                                    EXAMPLE
                                                    An investment adviser registered in State A, with no business locations in any other
                                                    state, has, over the preceding 12 months, directed investment advice to five individual
                                                    investors residing in State B. Is the investment adviser required to register in State B?
                                                    The answer is no! Registration is not required because the investment adviser does
                                                    not have a place of business in State B and directs business to five or fewer individual
                                                    residents of the state during the previous 12 months. If the firm had a place of
                                                    business in State B, registration would be required in that state even if it had only one
                                                    client. Also, registration would be required if business had been transacted with six or
                                                    more individual residents (retail clients) of State B during the previous 12 months.

                                                  What if the IA gave investment advice to six banks, six insurance companies, and six
                                                  other investment advisers instead of the individuals? Again, the answer would be no
                                                  registration. As long as the investment adviser has no place of business in the state
                                                  and limits its clientele to institutions, broker-dealers, large employee benefit plans, or
                                                  other investment advisers, it qualifies for this exemption.



                                    LO 9.c Identify the exempt reporting adviser and private fund adviser
                                    exemptions.

                                    We’ve just listed a number of exemptions under federal and state law. Here is another one that
                                    applies to both, with only a slight difference between them.


                                    Private Fund Advisers
                                    We introduced you to private funds in Unit 3 of this course. Here, we’ll go into a bit
                                    more of the legal details. Title IV of the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, known as the Private
                                    Fund Investment Advisers Registration Act of 2010, contains a comprehensive overhaul
                                    of the registration process for investment advisers. The bill provided for the following new
                                    exemptions from registration under the Advisers Act:
                                     An exemption for advisers solely to private funds—this exemption applies as long as that
                                       investment adviser’s total assets under management (AUM) in the United States, without
                                       regard to the number or type of private funds, is less than $150 million (the private fund
                                       adviser exemption)
                                     An exemption for certain non-U.S. advisers with no place of business in the United States
                                       and minimal assets under management (less than $25 million) attributable to U.S. clients
                                       and investors (the foreign private adviser exemption)
                                     An exemption for advisers solely to venture capital funds (the venture capital fund
                                       exception)

                                                  TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                  Recall that at LO 3.e we mentioned that hedge fund managers generally register with
                                                  the SEC even though the funds do not.
                                                                                                                                                       Unit 9
                                    Definition of a Private Fund
                                    As previously covered in Unit 3, Section 402 of the Dodd-Frank Act defines a private fund as
                                    “an issuer that would be an investment company, as defined in Section 3 of the Investment
                                    Company Act of 1940, but for Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that Act.”

                                    In more straightforward terms, a 3(c)(1) issuer is one whose outstanding securities are
                                    beneficially owned by not more than 100 persons, and which is not making and does
                                    not presently propose to make a public offering of its securities. With no more than 100
                                    shareholders and no public offering, the term private fund seems quite logical. For this
                                    exemption, the only status requirement for shareholders is that they are accredited investors.

                                    A 3(c)(7) issuer is one whose outstanding securities are owned exclusively by persons who,
                                    at the time of acquisition of such securities, are qualified purchasers (at least $5 million in
                                    investments for individuals and generally $25 million in investments for business entities),
                                    and who is not making and does not at that time propose to make, a public offering of such




09_0-2532_LEM_65E_Unit09.indd 193                                                                                                                28/10/22 1:45 PM

                                       securities. In this case, the lack of a public offering is logically private, and the fact that the
                                       invested wealth requirement limits the potential universe of investors is a factor as well.
                                       Unlike the 3(c)(1) issuer, there is no statutory limit to the number of investors.

                                       The point is, regardless of how it’s defined, if one is an adviser solely to private funds, it is
                                       possible to qualify for an exemption from registration with the SEC.

                                       As described previously, there is an exemption from registration for certain private funds and
                                       venture capital funds. However, even though exempt from registration, if designated as an
                                       exempt reporting advisor (ERA), they are required to complete and electronically file reports
                                       using the IARD system on certain items set forth in Form ADV, which will be made publicly
                                       available on the SEC’s website.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    There is a special reporting form for certain private fund advisers. This is an easy one
                                                    to remember because it is Form PF (Private Fund). Which advisers are required to file
                                                    Form PF?
                                                    Any person registered with the SEC as an investment adviser who manages one
                                                    or more private funds and had at least $150 million in private fund assets under
                                                    management as of the last day of its most recently completed fiscal year is required to
                                                    file Form PF.

                                       Well, what about state law? Their Model Rule closely parallels the federal exemption, with two
                                       differences.


                                       Private Fund Adviser Exemption Under State Law
                                       NASAA’s Model Rule for the Registration Exemption for Investment Advisers to Private
                                       Funds is almost identical to the federal exemption described previously. Here are the two
                                       differences that might be testable.

                                       If qualifying for the exemption as a 3(c)(1) issuer (no more than 100 investors), NASAA’s
                                       Model Rule requires that all investors be qualified clients.

                                       A qualified client is a person that:
                                        has at least $1.1 million in assets under management with the investment adviser
                                          immediately after entering into the advisory contract (AUM test); or
                                        has a net worth (in the case of a natural person client, together with assets held jointly
                                          with a spouse) that the investment adviser reasonably believes is in excess of $2.2 million
                                          immediately prior to entering into the advisory contract (net worth test).

                                       As a reminder, the value of a natural person’s primary residence must not be included in net
                                       worth.
                                        Remember, “value of primary residence” means the fair market value of a person’s primary
                                          residence, minus the amount of debt secured by the property up to its fair market value
                                          (net equity). Note that “qualified” for NASAA is significantly less than “qualified” under
                                          federal law.
                                        Neither the private fund adviser nor any of its advisory affiliates are subject to the “bad
                                          actor” provisions. Those provisions disqualify anyone who has certain criminal convictions
                                          (generally felonies), certain SEC disciplinary orders, or suspension or expulsion from
                                          membership in a self-regulatory organization such as FINRA.

                                    Exemption for Foreign Private Advisers
                                    A foreign private adviser is defined in the Dodd-Frank Act as any investment adviser that:
                                     has no place of business in the United States;
                                     has, in total, fewer than 15 clients and investors in the United States in private funds
                                       advised by the adviser;
                                     has aggregate assets under management attributable to clients in the United States
                                       and investors in the United States in private funds advised by the adviser of less than
                                       $25 million; and
                                     does not hold itself out to the public in the United States as an investment adviser or
                                       act as an investment adviser to an investment company registered under the Investment
                                       Company Act of 1940.


                                    Exemption for Investment Advisers to Venture Capital Funds
                                    The rules define a venture capital fund as a private fund that:
                                     has limited leverage;
                                     does not, except in certain limited circumstances, offer its investors redemption rights or
                                       other similar liquidity rights;
                                     represents itself as a venture capital fund to investors; and
                                     is not registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
                                    What really are venture capital funds? What is venture capital? You are probably familiar with
                                    the term start-up company. At one point in time, well-known firms like Google, Facebook, and
                                    Netflix were “young” and in need of additional capital to expand and grow. Venture capitalists
                                    are investors who are willing to take a chance on a new “venture,” recognizing that there is
                                    a high potential for loss as well as potential for gain that can, in some cases, be very high. A
                                    venture capital fund is a pooled investment where venture capitalists invest their money and
                                    pay an adviser to select opportunities meeting their objectives. If the conditions listed above
                                    are met, that investment adviser is exempt from registration under federal (and state) law.

                                    Please note that these exemptions are granted on the basis of whom you advise, not on what
                                    types of securities are the subject of your advice. Note also that exclusion means exclusion
                                    from a definition, whereas exemption means not subject to registration. All of the cases
                                    mentioned here involve investment advisers; it’s just that they qualify for an exemption from
                                    registration under federal law.

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                         Who of the following would not seek an exemption from registration under the
                                                         Investment Advisers Act of 1940?
                                                           A. A person whose only advisory clients are insurance companies
                                                           B. A person whose only offices are in a single state, whose only clients are
                                                               residents of that state, and who does not render advice on securities traded on
                                                               a national exchange
                                                           C. A person who only gives advice to venture capital funds
                                                           D. An accountant whose advice is incidental to her accounting business and for
                                                               which no separate fee is charged
                                                         Answer: D. This is tricky (as is the exam). The accountant is excluded from the
                                                         definition. Therefore, there is no reason for her to look for an exemption. Anyone who
                                                         is excluded is automatically exempt from registration. The other three choices meet
                                                         the definition of investment advisers and qualify for one of the exemptions described
                                                         above.

                                                    KNOWLEDGE CHECK 9.2
                                                    1.   A state-registered investment adviser would not qualify for the de minimis exemption
                                                         if, over a 12-month period, it had
                                                            A. five retail clients.
                                                           B. five or fewer retail clients.
                                                           C. fewer than six retail clients.
                                                           D. six or fewer retail clients.
                                                    2.   Section 402 of the Dodd-Frank Act defines a private fund as “an issuer that would
                                                         be an investment company, as defined in Section 3 of the Investment Company Act
                                                         of 1940, but for Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of that Act.” Section 3(c)(1) places a limit on
                                                         beneficial ownership of shares to not more than
                                                          A. 10 persons.
                                                          B. 35 persons.

                                                          D. 500 persons.


          LESSON 9.3: REGISTERING AS AN INVESTMENT ADVISER

                                       LO 9.d Recall the effects of the Dodd-Frank Act on the investment
                                       adviser registration process.


                                       Registration Requirements for Investment Advisers
                                       At this point, we know who is an investment adviser, who is excluded from the definition,
                                       and who, although defined as an investment adviser, is exempt from registration. If the person
                                       is not excluded and not exempt, then registration is required. In 1996, a major change to
                                       the registration requirements took place with the passage of the National Securities Markets
                                       Improvement Act (NSMIA). Up until that time, investment advisers registered with both the
                                       federal agency (the SEC) and the appropriate states. However, the NSMIA bifurcated (split in
                                       two) those requirements by declaring that investment advisers would register with the SEC or
                                       the state(s), but not both. They did this by creating a new definition: federal covered investment
                                       adviser, which is sometimes just referred to as a covered adviser on the exam.

                                         Unit 9    Regulation of Investment Advisers Including State-Registered and Federal Covered Advisers   197


                                    Federal Covered Investment Adviser
                                    What makes someone a federal covered investment adviser? In most cases, they are larger firms
                                    and are registered with the SEC. Here are the three most tested categories:
                                     Those registered with the SEC because they are eligible ($100 million in assets under
                                       management) or required to register with the SEC because they meet the minimum
                                       threshold of assets under management (currently $110 million)
                                     Those under contract to manage an investment company registered under the Investment
                                       Company Act of 1940—e.g., a mutual fund, regardless of the amount of assets under
                                       management
                                     Those not registered with the SEC because they are excluded from the definition of an
                                       investment adviser by the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the most tested example of
                                       this case is the investment adviser whose advice is limited solely to securities issued by the
                                       U.S. government or one of its agencies)

                                                  TAKE NOTE
                                                  Because so much of this exam deals with interpreting the laws, it is sometimes
                                                  necessary to review some legal concepts with you. For example, if a person is excluded
                                                  from the definition of investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940,
                                                  the states, under the NSMIA, cannot define such person as an investment adviser
                                                  because federal law excludes that person from the definition. In other words, if the
                                                  separate states could define those persons who were excluded from the federal
                                                  definition as investment advisers, the federal law would have no meaning.

                                                  TAKE NOTE
                                                  In 2012, the SEC came out with a new metric—Regulatory Assets Under Management
                                                  (RAUM). Is this simply a new name for AUM? No, it is a somewhat different
                                                  measurement and can be more or less than the investment adviser’s AUM. Although
                                                  that is the number determining SEC eligibility, we have never heard of “RAUM”
                                                  appearing on the exam. We use “AUM” in our text and QBank questions and will
                                                  continue to do so unless students tell us that NASAA has decided to use “RAUM.”


                                    Dodd-Frank and Assets Under Management
                                                                                                                                                      Unit 9
                                    As stated previously, the NSMIA eliminated state registration requirements for federal covered
                                    advisers, largely based upon assets under management (AUM). Dodd-Frank has created three
                                    thresholds: one for the large adviser, one for the mid-size adviser, and, logically, one for the
                                    small adviser. Let’s examine each of these—their requirements and their exceptions, if any.


                                    Large Investment Advisers
                                    Large advisers, those advisers with at least $100 million or more in assets under management,
                                    are eligible for SEC registration; once AUM reaches $110 million, registration with the SEC is
                                    mandatory. Unless covered by one of the exemptions mentioned previously, all large IAs must register
                                    with the SEC. State registration is not required because the federal law preempts state registration.

                                       Small Investment Advisers
                                       This category includes advisers with assets under management of less than $25 million.
                                       Unless the investment adviser is an adviser to an investment company registered under
                                       the Investment Company Act of 1940, registration with the SEC is prohibited and, unless
                                       exempted under state rules, registration with the state is required. However, if the adviser were
                                       required to register in 15 or more states, the prohibition would be lifted and registration with
                                       the SEC would be permitted instead.


                                       Mid-Size Advisers
                                       This category includes those with AUM of at least $25 million but not $100 million.
                                       Generally, these advisers are prohibited from SEC registration and must register with the
                                       state. However, there are more extensive exceptions than exist with the small advisers. Just as
                                       with any other category, those who are advisers to investment companies registered under the
                                       Investment Company Act of 1940 register with the SEC. That is true regardless of their size.

                                       There are several other ways for a mid-size firm to qualify for SEC registration. A mid-size
                                       adviser is not prohibited from registering with the SEC:
                                        if the adviser is not required to be registered as an investment adviser with the securities
                                          Administrator of the state in which it maintains its principal office and place of business;
                                        if registered, the adviser would not be subject to examination as an investment adviser by
                                          that securities Administrator;
                                        if the adviser is required to register in 15 or more states; or
                                        the adviser elects to take advantage of the buffer (described following).

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    The law (and often the exam) phrases things in a negative context. As stated above,
                                                    we have listed four cases where a mid-size investment adviser is not prohibited from
                                                    registration with the SEC. Put into simple language, that means they are eligible to
                                                    register with the SEC (if they desire) but not required to do so.


                                       Other Exceptions Under Dodd-Frank
                                       The SEC is permitted to grant exceptions to advisers from the prohibition on Commission
                                       registration, including small and mid-size advisers, if the application of the prohibition from
                                       registration would be “unfair, a burden on interstate commerce, or otherwise inconsistent with
                                       the purposes” of the act. Under this authority, they have adopted several exemptions from the
                                       prohibition on registration, including:
                                        pension consultants providing advisory services to employee benefit plans having at least
                                          $200 million of assets who may register with the SEC (even though the consultant does
                                          not itself have those assets under management). The SEC picked that number to ensure
                                          that, in order to register with the SEC, if desired, the consultant’s activities are “significant
                                          enough to have an effect on national markets”;
                                        those mid-size advisers with at least $100 million but less than $110 million in AUM
                                          who elect to register with the SEC rather than the state(s) (this buffer will be described
                                          below);
                                        investment advisers expecting to be eligible for SEC registration within 120 days of filing
                                          the application for registration on Form ADV; and
                                        internet advisers.

                                         Unit 9    Regulation of Investment Advisers Including State-Registered and Federal Covered Advisers   199


                                    The $10 Million and $20 Million Buffers
                                    The numbers work like this: A state-registered adviser, once it has assets under management of
                                    at least $100 million (subject to certain exceptions previously mentioned, everyone needs at
                                    least $100 million to initiate registration with the SEC), may choose to remain state-registered
                                    or may register with the SEC. Once AUM reach $110 million, registration with the SEC is
                                    mandatory—they can no longer stay state-registered. That is the $10 million buffer.

                                    The SEC recognized that market conditions (or obtaining or losing clients) can cause AUM to
                                    fluctuate, so they established a $20 million buffer to keep advisers from having to switch back
                                    and forth. Once registered with the SEC, an investment adviser need not withdraw its SEC
                                    registration unless it has less than $90 million in assets under management. Having become
                                    SEC registered, the IA can remain so as long as AUM remains, at or above the $90 million
                                    level. Likewise, those investment advisers registered at the state level can choose to remain
                                    there until they reach the $110 million level. This buffer is designed to avoid the expense and
                                    hassle involved in potentially annual changes to where the investment adviser is registered.


                                    Time for Measuring AUM
                                    These numbers are based on the AUM reported on the IA’s annual updating amendment. The
                                    effect of this is that a federal covered adviser’s AUM could drop below $90 million during
                                    the year without triggering the need to change to state registration, just as long as the annual
                                    update showed at least the minimum $90 million required. Of course, the same would be
                                    true of a state-registered IA whose AUM peaked above $110 million during the year but
                                    then fell at the time of the update. If, at the time of filing the annual updating amendment
                                    to the Form ADV by an SEC registered IA, the reported AUM is less than $90 million, it is
                                    necessary for the investment adviser to withdraw its SEC registration and register with the
                                    appropriate state(s) within 180 days. On the other hand, if a state-registered adviser’s reported
                                    AUM exceeds $110 million, registration with the SEC must take place within 90 days.

                                                  TAKE NOTE
                                                  The buffer works because the measurement is made only once per year—at the time
                                                  of the filing of the firm’s annual updating amendment.


                                     Remember these three relevant times:
                                     1. 	When a state-registered IA reports AUM at $110 million or more on the annual updating                         Unit 9
                                         amendment, the IA must withdraw from the states and register with the SEC within 90 days.
                                     2. 	 When a new investment adviser files for registration, if that IA believes that it will have at least
                                          $100 million in AUM within the first 120 days, it is eligible to register with the SEC, even if their
                                          AUM is way below that on “day 1.” This is very common when a large BD decides to open an IA
                                          and knows that they’ll have billions of dollars in a short time.
                                     3. 	 When an SEC registered IA reports less than $90 million in AUM on the annual updating
                                          amendment, the IA must withdraw its registration with the SEC and register in the appropriate
                                          states within 180 days. Why is the time allowed in #3 twice as long as in #1? Because it takes
                                          much less time to register with one agency, the SEC, than to register potentially with a number
                                          of states.

                                                  TAKE NOTE
                                                  As a general rule, the SEC or federal rules involve bigger numbers than the state rules—
                                                  that is, large investment advisers must register with the SEC, whereas small investment
                                                  advisers must register with the state(s).

                                                    under management has 90 days to register with the SEC. A federal covered investment

                                       including the use of the Form ADV.

                                       How does registration take place? With only a few differences, the procedures for registering
                                       as an investment adviser are the same, whether registering with the SEC or with the states.
                                       Those differences will be pointed out as we go along.


                                       Investment Adviser Registration Process
                                       To register with the state securities Administrator, a person must:
                                        submit an application;
                                        provide a consent to service of process;
                                        pay filing fees;
                                        post a bond (if required by the Administrator); and
                                        take and pass an examination if required by the Administrator. The examination may be
                                          written, oral, or both.

                                       Registration is accomplished using FormADV. Form ADV consists of Part 1A and Part 1B, and
                                       Part 2A and Part 2B. Investment advisers use Form ADV to:
                                        register with the Securities and Exchange Commission;
                                        register with one or more state securities authorities; or
                                        amend those registrations.

                                    Filing in almost all cases is done through the IARD. The Investment Adviser Registration
                                    Depository (IARD) is an electronic filing system that facilitates investment adviser
                                    registration, regulatory review, and the public disclosure information of investment adviser
                                    firms.


                                    Form ADV
                                    Form ADV contains four parts. Part 1A asks a number of questions about the investment
                                    adviser, its business practices, the persons who own and control the firm, and if the firm is
                                    involved in any other activities such as being a broker-dealer. All advisers registering with the
                                    SEC or any of the state securities authorities must complete Part 1A.

                                    Part 1A also contains several supplemental schedules. These include:
                                     Schedule A, which asks for information about the direct owners and executive officers
                                       (control persons); and
                                     Disclosure Reporting Pages (or DRPs), which are schedules that ask for details about
                                       disciplinary events involving the adviser or advisory affiliates.

                                    Part 1B asks additional questions required by state securities authorities. Investment advisers
                                    applying for registration with or who are already registered with the SEC do not have to
                                    complete Part 1B.

                                    Part 2A requires advisers to create narrative brochures containing information about the
                                    advisory firm. The requirements in Part 2A apply to all investment advisers registered with or
                                    applying for registration with the SEC or the states.

                                    Part 2B requires advisers to create brochure supplements containing information about
                                    certain supervised persons. The requirements in Part 2B apply to all investment advisers
                                    registered with or applying for registration with the SEC or the states.

                                    It may help you remember that the A in Part 2A tells us that that part is for the Adviser and
                                    the B in Part 2 is about the Bodies (the people) who work there.
                                    We will cover the brochures and brochure supplements in greater detail later in Unit 13.

                                                  Control means the power, directly or indirectly, to direct the management or policies                Unit 9
                                                  of an investment adviser, whether through ownership of securities, by contract, or
                                                  otherwise. Under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 as well as NASAA’s Model Rule,
                                                  each of the firm’s officers, partners, or directors exercising executive responsibility (or
                                                  persons having similar status or functions) is presumed to control the firm.
                                                  A person is presumed to control an IA organized as a corporation if the person directly
                                                  or indirectly has the right to vote 25% or more of a class of the corporation’s voting
                                                  securities; a person is presumed to control one that is a partnership if the person has
                                                  the right to receive upon dissolution, or has contributed, 25% or more of the capital of
                                                  the partnership.
                                                  Please note that this is a different percentage from the definition of control person
                                                  under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, where having more than 10% of the voting
                                                  power makes one a control person. Remember that a control person is defined three
                                                  different ways: the Exchange Act requires more than 10%, the Investment Company
                                                  Act (Unit 3) requires more than 25%, and the Advisers Act and the USA require 25% or
                                                  more.

                                       The application for registration as an investment adviser is on Form ADV.

                                       Part 1 contains information about the IA, including:
                                        location of principal office;
                                        location of books and records (if not at the principal office);
                                        form of business organization (sole proprietorship, partnership, corporation, LLC, etc.);
                                        method of business;
                                        other business activities (broker-dealer, registered representative [agent] of a BD);
                                        maintaining custody of customer assets or exercising discretion;
                                        details relating to all control persons (officers, directors, partners, etc.);
                                        disciplinary history; and
                                        for state-registered IAs, states in which the IA intends to register or is already registered.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    Should any of the above information change, prompt notification must be given to the
                                                    appropriate regulator.


                                       Part 1B asks additional questions required by state securities authorities. Federal covered
                                       advisers do not complete Part 1B.

                                       Part 2A is known as the investment adviser’s brochure and tends to focus on customer related
                                       information, such as:
                                        compensation arrangements (fees, commissions, hourly charge);
                                        types of clients (individuals, institutions, pension plans);
                                        type of investments (equities, corporate debt, municipal securities, U.S. Treasuries,
                                          investment companies);
                                        types of strategies employed (buy and hold, value, growth);
                                        methods of analysis used (technical, fundamental);
                                        educational and business background of those who render advice; and
                                        an audited balance sheet if a federal covered or state-registered adviser requires or solicits
                                          substantial prepayment of fees (defined shortly) or if a state-registered adviser maintains
                                          custody (discussed in Unit 14).

                                       The brochure is arranged in a narrative form using plain English.

                                       Part 2B requires advisers to create brochure supplements containing information about certain
                                       supervised persons. Together, Part 2A and Part 2B are delivered to the client as described later
                                       in this unit.

                                       State-registered advisers file both Part 1 and Part 2 with the Administrator of each state in
                                       which they are registering.

                                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                      If a prospective client wanted to know what type of investment strategies are
                                                      employed by an investment adviser, the information would be found in the adviser’s
                                                        A. Form ADV Part 1A.

                                                      Answer: C. Form ADV Part 2A contains information of most use to clients, such as
                                                      the type of strategies employed by the adviser. Part 1A contains information needed
                                                      by the regulators; Part 1B is only for state-registered IAs; Part 2B contains information
                                                      dealing with those individuals in the firm who manage accounts.

                                                  TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                  Although there are no minimum educational or experience requirements, there is a
                                                  specific area on Form ADV Part 2B where state-registered advisers must identify each
                                                  of the principal executive officers and management persons and describe their formal
                                                  education and business background. If this information has been supplied elsewhere
                                                  in Form ADV, it is not necessary to repeat it in response to this question.


                                    Updating Form ADV
                                    Formal renewal of the investment adviser’s registration is through the filing of the annual
                                    updating amendment. Form ADV must be updated each year by filing an annual updating
                                    amendment within 90 days after the end of the adviser’s fiscal year. This annual updating
                                    amendment is used to update the responses to all items on the ADV. Of critical importance
                                    is the verification of assets under management (AUM) ensuring that the adviser is eligible to
                                    continue being registered with the SEC. One of the requirements relating to the brochure
                                    described in Part 2 is that submission must be made of a summary of material changes either in
                                    the brochure (cover page or the page immediately thereafter) or as an exhibit to the brochure.


                                    Amendments for Material Changes
                                    In addition to the annual updating amendment, the IA must amend Form ADV by filing
                                    additional amendments if information relating to any of the following changes or becomes
                                    inaccurate in any way:
                                     Change of the registrant’s name                                                                                 Unit 9
                                     Change in the principal business location
                                     Change in the location of books and records, if they are kept somewhere other than at the

                                       Fees
                                       In addition to the initial registration, there is a requirement for annual renewal. There are
                                       fees for the initial filing and renewals. If an investment adviser changes its form of business
                                       organization (e.g., from a sole proprietorship to a corporation), an amended ADV, but no
                                       fees, would be required.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    Under both federal and state law, a successor firm registers by filing a new
                                                    application (ADV Parts 1 and 2) and, in the case of the SEC, paying the appropriate fee
                                                    or, under the USA, without paying an additional fee. Please note the difference—one
                                                    case involves a fee while the other does not.


                                       Notice Filing
                                       While on the topic of fees, it is important to recognize what happened to state revenues
                                       after the passage of the NSMIA. Prior to that time, investment advisers registered on both
                                       levels, and that meant, in many cases, registering with 20, 30, or more states with each state
                                       collecting a nice fee. When state lobbyists realized that the NSMIA, by excluding federal
                                       covered advisers from the definition, meant that those advisers would no longer have to
                                       register, they implored Congress to put some condition into the act that would help recover
                                       some of that lost revenue. That is how notice filing came about.

                                       Instead of registering with the state(s), covered advisers pay state filing fees and give notice to
                                       the Administrator. The procedure followed is called notice filing. As part of the notice filing,
                                       the Administrator can require a federal covered adviser to file a copy of whatever has been
                                       filed with the SEC and, of course, pay a filing fee.

                                       If a federal covered adviser only deals with institutions, other IAs, other BDs, and so forth,
                                       notice filing is not required. This is a similar concept to the USA not requiring registration
                                       of state-registered advisers who have no place of business in the state and deal with this same
                                       group of clients. We have not heard of this ever being asked on the exam, but you never know
                                       what NASAA has up their sleeve.


                                       Provide a Consent to Service of Process
                                       New applicants for registration must provide the Administrator of every state in which they
                                       intend to register with a consent to service of process. The consent to service of process
                                       appoints the Administrator as the applicant’s attorney to receive and process noncriminal
                                       securities-related complaints against the applicant. Under the consent to service of process,
                                       all legal documents (e.g., subpoenas or warrants) received by the Administrator have the same
                                       legal effect as if they had been served personally on the applicant.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    The consent to service of process is submitted with the initial application and
                                                    remains in force permanently. It does not need to be supplied with each renewal of a
                                                    registration.

                                    Effective Date of Registration and Renewals
                                    Assuming there are no irregularities in the application, registration with the SEC takes effect
                                    on the 45th day after filing of a complete application and, as with all securities professionals,
                                    at noon of the 30th day in the case of state-registered investment advisers.

                                                  TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                  One of the most common questions asked on the exam is the renewal date for the
                                                  state registration of investment advisers (and the other securities professionals—
                                                  investment adviser representatives, broker-dealers, and agents). That renewal date
                                                  is December 31. One of the tricks the exam likes to play is asking about a person who
                                                  registers in November. When does that registration come up for renewal? Well, even if
                                                  it is only a month or so later, every registration of a securities professional comes up
                                                  for renewal on the NEXT December 31, so your first year is always a short one.

                                                  TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                  Although withdrawal of registration normally takes 30 days, the Administrator has the
                                                  power to shorten that period, in effect permitting a rush order.

                                                  TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                  Although successful completion of the Series 65 examination may satisfy a portion of
                                                  the requirements of a particular state, it does not convey the right to transact business
                                                  prior to being granted a license or registration by that state.

                                                  TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                  While registration as an IAR is pending, the individual may not take part in any activity
                                                  that would require registration. Clerical work (filing customer records) or assisting
                                                  internally with research would be permitted.

                                    Just as the exam may ask about registering, it may ask about leaving the business.


                                    Form ADV-W
                                    If an adviser no longer desires to engage in the business, application to withdraw registration
                                                                                                                                                       Unit 9
                                    is accomplished by filing Form ADV-W. Form ADV-W must be filed in order to withdraw
                                    the registration voluntarily.
                                    Should there be any legal proceedings in progress, the withdrawal will be held up until
                                    resolution of the issue. Otherwise, each Form ADV-W filed by an SEC registered adviser is
                                    effective upon acceptance by the IARD. However, the investment adviser’s registration will
                                    continue for a period of 60 days after acceptance solely for the purpose of commencing a
                                    proceeding against the firm. In the case of a state-registered adviser, withdrawal is effective
                                    30 days after filing, but the Administrator retains jurisdiction over the former registrant for a
                                    period of one year.

                                    In Unit 12, we’ll discuss the conditions under which a registration may be canceled by the
                                    Administrator.

                                       Exempt Reporting Advisers (ERAs)
                                       As described previously, there is an exemption from registration for certain private funds and
                                       venture capital funds. However, even though exempt from registration, if designated as exempt
                                       reporting advisers (ERAs), they are required to complete and electronically file reports using the
                                       Investment Adviser Registration Depository (IARD) system on certain amended items set forth
                                       in Form ADV Part 1, which will be made publicly available on the SEC’s website.

                                                    questions) but do not have to prepare a Form ADV Part 2.

                                                         prohibited for which of the following investment advisers?
                                                           A. A pension consultant managing $150 million

          LESSON 9.4: FINANCIAL AND RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS FOR
          INVESTMENT ADVISERS

                                       LO 9.f Recognize the financial requirements to register as an
                                       investment adviser.

                                       Under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, there are no specific financial requirements, such
                                       as a minimum net worth. However, as we will see, there are financial disclosures that must be
                                       made to clients under certain conditions.


                                       Investment Adviser Financial Requirements
                                       Under the Uniform Securities Act, the Administrator may, by rule or order, establish
                                       minimum financial requirements for an investment adviser registered in the state. We
                                       will begin with some requirements that apply to both federal covered and state-registered
                                       investment advisers.


                                       Substantial Prepayment of Fees
                                       Both state and federal law offer extra protection to those clients of investment advisers who
                                       have made substantial advance payment of fees for services to be rendered in the future.
                                       The term used is substantial prepayment of fees. In the case of a federal covered adviser, it is




09_0-2532_LEM_65E_Unit09.indd 206                                                                                                               02/11/22 1:47 PM

                                    considered substantial if the IA collects prepayments of l $1,200 per client, six months or
                                    more in advance. Under the USA, it is more than $500, and again, six months or more in
                                    advance.

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   Under the USA, when an investment adviser accepts prepayments of fees of more
                                                   than $500 for a contract period of six months or more, it is known as a substantial
                                                   prepayment. However, under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, it does not become
                                                   a substantial prepayment until it exceeds $1,200.


                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                       Which of the following would NASAA consider to be a substantial prepayment of fees?
                                                        A. $500 covering the next six months
                                                        B. $800 covering the entire contract year
                                                        C. $800 covering the next calendar quarter
                                                        D. $5,000 covering the next month
                                                       Answer: B. NASAA (state law) defines a substantial prepayment of fees to be more
                                                       than $500, six or more months in advance. While $800 and $5,000 are certainly more
                                                       than $500, they cover a shorter period than six months.


                                    Disclosure of Financial Impairment
                                    Any investment adviser that has discretionary authority or custody of client funds or
                                    securities, or requires or solicits substantial prepayment of fees, must disclose any financial
                                    condition that is reasonably likely to impair its ability to meet contractual commitments
                                    to its clients. As an example, the SEC has indicated that disclosure may be required of
                                    any arbitration award “sufficiently large that payment of it would create such a financial
                                    condition.”

                                    Here is the way it is stated in Form ADV Part 2:

                                    If you have discretionary authority or custody of client funds or securities, or you require or solicit
                                    prepayment of more than $1,200 in fees per client, six months or more in advance, you must
                                    disclose any financial condition that is reasonably likely to impair your ability to meet contractual
                                    commitments to clients.
                                                                                                                                                       Unit 9
                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   The Administrator may require an adviser who has custody of client funds or securities
                                                   or has discretion over a client’s account to post a surety bond or maintain a minimum
                                                   net worth. The requirement is higher for custody than for discretion. Typically, the net
                                                   worth required of investment advisers with discretionary authority is $10,000, and that
                                                   for those taking custody, whether or not they are exercising discretion, is $35,000. If
                                                   the adviser is using a surety bond instead, the requirement in either case is $35,000.
                                                   An adviser who does not exercise discretion and does not maintain custody but does
                                                   accept prepayment of fees of more than $500, six or more months in advance, must
                                                   maintain a positive net worth at all times.

                                    Definition: surety bond. A surety bond is usually issued by an insurance company (the
                                    surety) who guarantees payment of a specified sum to an injured party (either the client or
                                    the Administrator) when the securities professional causes damages by her actions or fails to
                                    perform.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    Because the Uniform Securities Act is only a template, some states have higher
                                                    net worth or bonding requirements. The exam may want you to know that if a
                                                    state-registered IA meets the net worth or surety bonding requirements of the state
                                                    where its principal office is located, that is sufficient in any other state in which it may
                                                    be registered.
                                       Definition: principal office. We’ve used this term several times, and it is an important one to
                                       know. Both state and federal law define this as “the executive office of the investment adviser
                                       from which the officers, partners, or managers of the investment adviser direct, control, and
                                       coordinate the activities of the investment adviser.”

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                         Mammon Money Managers (MMM) has its principal office in State A and is also
                                                         registered in States B, C, and D. MMM exercises discretion in client accounts. As a
                                                         result, MMM would have to meet the net worth or bonding requirements of
                                                           A. the SEC.
                                                           B. State A.
                                                           C. the state with the highest requirement.
                                                          D. each state.
                                                         Answer: B. A state-registered investment adviser need only meet the financial
                                                         requirements of the state in which its principal office is located. SEC requirements are
                                                         meaningless here because this is a state-registered firm.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    One of the effects of the NSMIA is to limit the powers of an Administrator over a federal
                                                    covered adviser. Section 222 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 states that when it
                                                    comes to federal covered advisers, any financial or bonding requirements, as well as
                                                    rules relating to recordkeeping, are solely under federal jurisdiction.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    The proper term to use when referring to the financial requirements of an investment
                                                    adviser is net worth, while for broker-dealers it is net capital. However, we have heard
                                                    from a number of students that NASAA might be using net capital where they should
                                                    be using net worth in questions about IAs. So, if you want to get the question right,
                                                    answer it the way they give it to you. You will see several examples of this in our
                                                    practice questions.


                                       Failure to Maintain Minimum Net Worth
                                       The USA specifies the action to be taken by a registered investment adviser whose net worth
                                       falls below the required minimum. By the close of business on the next business day, the
                                       adviser must notify the Administrator that the investment adviser’s net worth is less than the
                                       minimum required. After sending that notice, the adviser must file a financial report with the
                                       Administrator by the close of business on the next business day. One more item that must be
                                       included in the report is the number of client accounts. When the adviser’s net worth is below
                                       the minimum requirement, the adviser must obtain a bond in an amount of the net worth
                                       deficiency rounded up to the nearest $5,000.

                                                  EXAMPLE
                                                  A state-registered investment adviser discovers on Monday that its net worth is below
                                                  the minimum requirement. No later than the close of business on Tuesday, notice
                                                  must be sent to the Administrator of the state in which the investment adviser has
                                                  its principal office. Then, no later than the close of business on Wednesday, the
                                                  investment adviser must file a detailed report with the Administrator of its financial
                                                  condition. Included in the report must be a statement as to the number of client
                                                  accounts.

                                                  EXAMPLE
                                                  An investment adviser who maintains custody of customer funds and securities
                                                  discovers that its net worth is only $23,000. Even though the adviser only needs a
                                                  net worth of $35,000, this would require immediate surety bonding in the amount of
                                                  $15,000 because it must be rounded up to the nearest $5,000.


                                    Computing Net Worth
                                    At Unit 7, LO 7.a, we learned about computing net worth from a corporate balance sheet.
                                    For NASAA purposes, the term net worth is the excess of assets over liabilities (assets minus
                                    liabilities). However, NASAA does not permit the investment adviser to include the following
                                    as assets: Goodwill and all other assets of an intangible nature, home, home furnishings,
                                    automobile(s), and any other personal items not readily marketable in the case of an
                                    individual; advances or loans to stockholders and officers in the case of a corporation; and
                                    advances or loans to partners in the case of a partnership. However, furniture used in the
                                    office, such as a sofa in the reception room or bookcases in the company research library, are
                                    considered assets for the purpose of the computation.


                                    LO 9.g Recall the investment adviser books and recordkeeping
                                    requirements under state and federal law.


                                    Books and Records
                                    Once registered, there are a number of post-registration activities required, such as

                                                                                                                                                       Unit 9
                                    recordkeeping, annual filings, and other reports. The Uniform Securities Act virtually
                                    duplicates the first 12 items of the recordkeeping requirements of the Investment Advisers Act
                                    of 1940 listed below.

                                    The Investment Advisers Act requires every adviser (other than ones specifically exempted
                                    from registration) to make, keep, and preserve such records, and for such periods as the
                                    SEC may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of
                                    investors. By rule, the SEC has set forth various recordkeeping requirements for investment
                                    advisers. Moreover, the act makes it unlawful for any person to willfully make any untrue
                                    statement of a material fact in any report filed with the SEC or to willfully omit to state in a
                                    report any material fact required to be stated therein.

                                    The SEC and the states require investment advisers to maintain the following books and
                                    records:
                                     A journal, including cash receipts and disbursement records

                                          litigation involving the investment adviser or any investment adviser representative or
                                          employee, and regarding any written customer or client complaint
                                        A file containing a copy of each document that pertains to the registrant or its investment
                                          adviser representatives; the file should contain, but is not limited to, all applications,
                                          amendments, renewal filings, and correspondence
                                        With certain exceptions, a record of all securities transactions in which an investment
                                          adviser or any advisory representative has, or by reason of such transaction acquires, any
                                          direct or beneficial ownership

                                       In practice, the recordkeeping rule has served as a deterrent to the practice of scalping because
                                       it requires all advisory representatives to report all of their security transactions to their
                                       affiliated advisory firms on a regular basis; these reports are subject to SEC examination.
                                       Scalping is the practice whereby an investment adviser, before the dissemination of a
                                       securities recommendation, trades on the anticipated short-run market activity that may result
                                       from the recommendation.

                                         Unit 9     Regulation of Investment Advisers Including State-Registered and Federal Covered Advisers   211


                                    Time Period for Maintenance of Records
                                    The Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as well as the NASAA Model Rule on Investment
                                    Adviser Recordkeeping, requires that an investment adviser’s books and records be maintained
                                    in a readily accessible place for five years. The five-year period will run from the end of the
                                    fiscal year during which the last entry was made on the record. During the first two years of
                                    the five-year period, the rule requires that the records be maintained in the principal office of
                                    the adviser. After this initial two-year period, the records may be preserved in electronic or
                                    microfilm format or any other form of data storage in compliance with the act. Even though
                                    the recordkeeping requirements are almost identical, it is important to remember for the test
                                    that federal covered advisers only comply with the SEC’s requirements, while state-registered
                                    advisers need only meet the requirements of the state where their principal office is located.

                                    Under both federal and state requirements, partnership articles and any amendments thereto,
                                    articles of incorporation, charters, minute books, and stock certificate books of the investment
                                    adviser and of any predecessor must be maintained in the principal office of the investment
                                    adviser and preserved until at least three years after termination of the enterprise.

                                                  TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                  A few pages ago, we gave you a Test Topic Alert that emphasized that as long as
                                                  state-registered investment advisers meet the net worth or surety bond requirements
                                                  of their home state, that is sufficient for any state in which they are registered. The
                                                  same is true regarding recordkeeping requirements, and the proof is in the following
                                                  statement copied from Form ADV:
                                                  2. State-Registered Investment Adviser Affidavit
                                                  If you are subject to state regulation, by signing this Form ADV, you represent that you
                                                  are in compliance with the registration requirements of the state in which you maintain
                                                  your principal place of business and are in compliance with the bonding, capital, and
                                                  recordkeeping requirements of that state.


                                    Storage Requirements
                                    The records required may be maintained and preserved for the required time by an investment
                                    adviser on:
                                     paper or hard copy form, as those records are kept in their original form;
                                     micrographic media, including microfilm, microfiche, or any similar medium; or                                  Unit 9
                                     electronic storage media, including any digital (computer disk) storage medium or system
                                       as long as the investment adviser establishes and maintains procedures
                                        –– to maintain and preserve the records so as to reasonably safeguard them from loss,
                                           alteration, or destruction,
                                        –– to limit access to the records to properly authorized personnel and the Administrator,
                                           and
                                        –– to reasonably ensure that any reproduction of a nonelectronic original record on
                                           electronic storage media is complete, true, and legible when retrieved.

                                    In all cases, the investment adviser must arrange and index the records in a way that permits
                                    easy location, access, and retrieval of any particular record and provide the Administrator with
                                    the means to access, view, and print the records.

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                         Under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, all of the following are true regarding
                                                         adviser recordkeeping except
                                                          A. the IA must keep records of transactions made for its own account as well as
                                                              the account of investment adviser representatives to lessen the likelihood of
                                                              scalping.
                                                          B. computer-generated records may be stored in that format.
                                                          C. client account records must be maintained, including a list of
                                                              recommendations made.
                                                          D. records must be maintained for a period of two years from the end of the fiscal
                                                              year in which the last entry was made.
                                                         Answer: D. This is the exception, because the records must be kept for five years.
                                                         Nothing in the question asked about the two-year requirement in the office. The
                                                         five-year requirement is that records be easily accessible whether in the office or not.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    You will need to remember that the record retention requirement for investment
                                                    advisers is five years from the end of the year in which the record was originally
                                                    generated.



                                       LO 9.h Recognize that investment adviser representatives must be
                                       adequately supervised.

                                       Each registered investment adviser must adopt and implement written policies and procedures
                                       designed to prevent violation of the federal and state securities laws, review those policies and
                                       procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation, and
                                       designate a chief compliance officer (CCO) to be responsible for administering the policies
                                       and procedures. An adviser’s chief compliance officer should be competent and knowledgeable
                                       regarding the Advisers Act and the USA and should be empowered with full responsibility
                                       and authority to develop and enforce appropriate policies and procedures for the firm. Thus,
                                       the compliance officer should have a position of sufficient seniority and authority within the
                                       organization to compel others to adhere to the compliance policies and procedures. In fact,
                                       the CCO’s identity must be disclosed on Form ADV.

                                       In keeping with the times, one of the areas that must be covered in these written procedures
                                       deals with physical security and cybersecurity. An investment adviser must establish,
                                       implement, update, and enforce written physical security and cybersecurity policies and
                                       procedures reasonably designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of
                                       physical and electronic records and information. The policies and procedures must be tailored
                                       to the investment adviser’s business model, taking into account the size of the firm, type(s) of
                                       services provided, and the number of locations of the investment adviser. We’ll have more to
                                       say about this topic in Unit 14.

                                       The role of the CCO is particularly important when it comes to ensuring supervision of those
                                       individuals referred to as “supervised persons.” Failure to supervise can lead to suspension or
                                       revocation of the investment adviser’s registration.
                                       Definition: supervised person. A supervised person is any of the IA’s officers, partners,
                                       directors (or other persons occupying a similar status or performing similar functions), or
                                       employees, or any other person who provides investment advice on the investment adviser’s
                                       behalf and is subject to its supervision or control. The most common example is the
                                       investment adviser representative (defined in Unit 10).

                                         Unit 9        Regulation of Investment Advisers Including State-Registered and Federal Covered Advisers   213


                                    Although many supervised persons fall within the definition of “investment adviser” (they
                                    meet the three-prong test), the SEC and the states do not require those individuals to register
                                    as investment advisers with the regulators. Instead, the advisory firm must register. The
                                    adviser’s registration covers its employees and other persons under its control, provided that
                                    their advisory activities are undertaken on the investment adviser’s behalf. In most cases, these
                                    individuals must register as investment adviser representatives and come under the adviser’s
                                    supervisory jurisdiction.

                                    This is particularly true in the case of financial planners who have elected to operate as
                                    independent contractors, not employees of investment advisory firms. Regardless, they are
                                    required to be registered as investment adviser representatives of the firm and must be placed
                                    under the same level of supervisory scrutiny as employees. Their business cards may contain
                                    the name of their separate planning entity but must also disclose the name of the entity
                                    registered as the investment adviser.

                                    Do not confuse this with a similar term defined in the Advisers Act: person associated with
                                    an investment adviser. A person associated with an investment adviser is “any partner,
                                    officer, or director of such investment adviser (or any person performing similar functions),
                                    or any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by such investment adviser,
                                    including any employee of such investment adviser, except that for persons associated with
                                    an investment adviser whose functions are clerical or ministerial shall not be included in the
                                    meaning of such term.”

                                    What is the difference? Supervised person includes every employee, while associated person
                                    excludes clerical and administrative employees.

                                                         records as specified by the Uniform Securities Act. Which of the following statements
                                                         regarding adviser recordkeeping is not true?

             INTRODUCTION
                                    In Unit 9, we defined an investment adviser and determined who was excluded from the
                                    definition or exempt from registration and, if required to register, with whom and how. In this
                                    unit, we will cover those individuals who represent investment advisers: investment adviser
                                    representatives. One important regulatory note is that, unlike investment advisers who register
                                    either on a federal or a state level, registration requirements of representatives only come under
                                    the jurisdiction of the states. That is why this is a NASAA exam rather than one sponsored by
                                    FINRA or the SEC.

          LESSON 10.1: WHO IS AN INVESTMENT ADVISER REPRESENTATIVE?
                                        LO 10.a Define an investment adviser representative.

                                        Let’s begin by looking at the final word in the phrase investment adviser representative:
                                        representative. Representatives always represent someone else. In this case, these are individuals
                                        who represent an investment advisory firm. As defined in the law, an investment adviser
                                        representative (IAR) is any partner, officer, director (or an individual occupying a similar status
                                        or performing similar functions), or other individual employed by or associated with an
                                        investment adviser and is registered or required to be registered under the Uniform Securities
                                        Act. Remember, IARs register only with the states. An individual meets the definition of an
                                        IAR by doing any of the following:
                                         Makes any recommendations or otherwise renders advice regarding securities
                                         Manages accounts or portfolios of clients
                                         Determines which recommendation or advice regarding securities should be given
                                         Solicits, offers, or negotiates for the sale of or sells investment advisory services
                                         Supervises employees who perform any of the foregoing

                                                    EXAMPLE
                                                    An individual employed by an investment adviser who manages investment portfolios
                                                    for clients is considered an investment adviser representative. So is the individual who
                                                    supervises that person. Under state law, there is no distinct registration for supervisory
                                                    persons as there is under FINRA’s rules for broker-dealers; even the CEO is registered
                                                    as an IAR.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    The use of the term individual here is important. Only an individual, or a natural
                                                    person, can be an investment adviser representative. The investment advisory firm
                                                    is the legal person (entity) that the IAR (natural person) represents in performing the
                                                    above listed functions.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    An individual may act as both an investment adviser and an investment adviser
                                                    representative. This is typically the case when the business is organized as a sole
                                                    proprietorship. However, an individual who acts solely as an investment adviser
                                                    representative is excluded from the definition of investment adviser.

                                    Just as with investment advisers, the laws provide for exclusions for the definition and

                                    representative, provided their activities are confined to clerical or administrative duties or those
                                    activities that are solely incidental to the investment advisory services offered, such as mailing
                                    out a research report to an advisory client when directed by an IAR. Should the investment
                                    advisory employee “step over the line,” as the saying goes, and perform any activity that makes
                                    one an IAR, the employee would then have to register as an investment adviser representative.

                                    In addition, an individual is not an investment adviser representative if the person does not
                                    on a regular basis solicit, meet with, or otherwise communicate with clients of the investment
                                    adviser or provides only impersonal investment advice.

                                    Let’s define that last term because you’re going to see it a number of times in this course.
                                    Impersonal investment advice means investment advisory services provided by means of written
                                    material or oral statements that do not purport to meet the objectives or needs of specific
                                    individuals or accounts.

                                               PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   Which of the following individuals would be defined as an investment adviser
                                                   representative?
                                                     A. Melinda, one of the firm’s research analysts who has no contact with public
                                                        clients
                                                     B. Johnny, an employee who makes cold calls soliciting for new advisory clients
                                                     C. Mel, who prepares client account statements
                                                    D. Jane, who is the firm’s VP of HR services
                                                   Answer: B. One of the functions that makes a supervised person an IAR is soliciting
                                                   for new business. Research personnel are not considered IARs unless they have client
                                                   relationships. Mel’s job is purely clerical and, even though Jane is a vice president,
                                                   the HR department is far removed from anything to do with giving investment advice.


                                    Exemptions from Registration as an Investment Adviser
                                    Representative
                                    There are three different exemptions available for those defined as IARs. Two of these are for those
                                    who represent state-registered IAs and the other for those who represent federal covered IAs.

                                                                                                                                                Unit 10
                                     If the individual represents a state-registered adviser, there is a de minimis exemption. Just
                                       as is the case with investment advisers, if an IAR does not maintain a place of business
                                       in the state and, during the preceding 12-month period, has had no more than five retail
                                       clients, registration in the state is not required.
                                     The previously mentioned snowbird exemption also applies to these IARs.

                                         If the individual represents a federal covered investment adviser, there is a special
                                           exemption under Section 203A of the 1940 Act. Keeping it simple, it states that for those
                                           performing as IARs for covered advisers, IAR registration is required only in those states
                                           where that individual has a place of business. Place of business of an investment adviser
                                           representative means:
                                             –– an office at which the investment adviser representative regularly provides investment
                                                advisory services or solicits, meets with, or otherwise communicates with clients; and
                                             –– any other location that is held out to the general public as a location at which the
                                                investment adviser representative provides investment advisory services or solicits,
                                                meets with, or otherwise communicates with clients.

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTIONS
                                                    1.   Under the Uniform Securities Act, which of the following is not required to register as
                                                         an investment adviser representative?
                                                          A. A director of a state-registered investment advisory firm who determines
                                                               specific recommendations for clients
                                                          B. An associate in an SEC-registered investment advisory firm who has a place of
                                                               business in the state and manages the account of only one individual client
                                                          C. A clerk employed by a state-registered investment advisory firm
                                                          D. A vice president of a state-registered investment advisory firm who supervises
                                                               employees who solicit clients for the firm
                                                         Answer: C. Clerical and ministerial (administrative) personnel are specifically
                                                         excluded from the definition of investment adviser representative. Specifically
                                                         included in the definition are directors, officers, partners, associates, and employees
                                                         of state-registered advisers who carry out investment advisory or solicitation
                                                         functions or who supervise those functions. Also included in the definition are
                                                         persons who perform similar functions for SEC-registered advisers and who have a
                                                         place of business in the state. Once there is a place of business in the state, the de
                                                         minimis rule no longer applies.
                                                    2.   Which of the following individuals would be required to register with the
                                                         Administrator of a state?
                                                          A. Walter, who represents a state-registered adviser, has no place of business in
                                                              the state and only serves existing clients who vacation in the state.
                                                          B. May, who represents a covered adviser, has no place of business in the state
                                                              and has 38 clients who reside in the state.
                                                          C. Aliza, who represents a state-registered adviser, has no place of business in the
                                                              state and had fewer than six individual clients who were residents of the state
                                                              during the past 12 months.
                                                          D. Joe, who represents a covered adviser, has a place of business in the state
                                                              and had four retail clients who were residents of the state during the past 12
                                                              months.
                                                         Answer: D. Once an IAR maintains a place of business in a state, they must register in
                                                         that state regardless of the number of clients—such is the case with Joe. Walter need
                                                         not register because he qualifies for the snowbird exemption. May qualifies for the
                                                         exemption as an IAR of a federal covered investment adviser. She is only required to
                                                         register in those states where she maintains a place of business. Aliza qualifies for the
                                                         de minimis exemption (fewer than six is the same as five or fewer).
                                                    Important note: Even if May’s employer had a place of business in the state, she
                                                    would not have to register because she, the IAR, doesn’t. Of course, her employer,
                                                    being federal covered, doesn’t register in any states.

                                                    representative?
                                                      A. A corporation
                                                     B. An individual
                                                      C. A partnership

                                               2.   An individual representing a state-registered investment adviser would not qualify for
                                                    the de minimis exemption in a state if, over a 12-month period, she had
                                                      A. five retail clients.
                                                     B. five or fewer retail clients.

                                                     D. six or fewer retail clients.



             LESSON 10.2: REGISTRATION AND POST-REGISTRATION
             REQUIREMENTS OF INVESTMENT ADVISER REPRESENTATIVES

                                    LO 10.c Describe the investment adviser representative registration
                                    process, required post-registration filings, and business activities.


                                    IAR Registration Process
                                    As we learned with investment advisers, if you are not excluded from the definition of
                                    investment adviser representative or if you don’t qualify for one of the exemptions, then you
                                    have to register. And, as pointed out earlier, it is only on the state level that an IAR registers,
                                    so we don’t have the issue of comparing state and federal law as we do with IAs.

                                    Unless properly registered, it is unlawful for any registered investment adviser to engage the
                                    services of an individual as an investment adviser representative if that individual is required
                                    to register. This is true whether the investment adviser is state-registered or federal covered. All
                                    IARs must be registered in at least one state (they have to have a place of business somewhere,
                                    right?).

                                    Registration is accomplished by filing a Form U4 (a Form U10 can be used in certain
                                    cases, but that is unlikely to be tested) through FINRA’s CRD (Central Registration
                                    Depository). Most of you have already completed that form, so you know it asks about your
                                    personal history and details. One of the most important parts is the DRPs, the Disclosure
                                    Reporting Pages. It is on these pages that the applicant discloses past disciplinary events.
                                    Form U4 requires disclosing if you have ever been convicted or even just charged (an arrest
                                    without a charge is not reportable), with no time limit, for any felony or securities-related
                                    misdemeanors. In Unit 12, we’ll discuss how those can affect the application. Another
                                    important part of Form U4 is the Consent to Service of Process, mentioned earlier in Unit 9
                                    in conjunction with the registration of an IA.

          222        Unit 10    Regulation of Investment Adviser Representatives



                                        Automatic Registration of Certain Individuals
                                        Here is an important item dealing with registration that is frequently tested.

                                        The Uniform Securities Act states, “Registration of an investment adviser automatically
                                        constitutes registration of any investment adviser representative who is a partner, officer, or
                                        director, or a person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions.”

                                        It isn’t only the title that determines your registration; it is also the function performed.
                                        Note that the rule quoted above states that the IAR is a partner, officer, or director of the
                                        investment adviser. Doesn’t that mean they are already registered? What is the purpose of
                                        “automatic” registration to someone already registered?

                                        When a state-registered IA expands its business so that registration is required in another state
                                        (or states), the application process is basically the same as their initial state registration. That
                                        is, a Form ADV is filed. That filing includes the names and other pertinent information about
                                        all of the partners, officers, or directors who are already acting as IARs. Therefore, when the
                                        firm’s registration becomes effective in that “new” state, those individuals included in the filing
                                        are granted automatic registration—they don’t have to file an individual Form U4. Please note
                                        that it is not any IAR, but only those listed or, as the rule states, those occupying a similar
                                        status, etc., who receive this treatment. Any of the firm’s other existing IARs who will need to
                                        be registered in the “new” state must file an amended Form U4 with the Administrator and
                                        wait for their supervisor to tell them that the firm has received the word that their registration
                                        is effective with that state.

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                         When an investment adviser registers in a new state, which of the following are
                                                         automatically registered as IARs?
                                                          A. Any employee who is functioning as an IAR in at least one state
                                                          B. Officers, partners, and directors of the firm who are functioning as IARs
                                                          C. Clerical employees stuffing the envelopes with research reports
                                                          D. Any employee who will be soliciting clients for the adviser
                                                         Answer: B. As we just stated, the “automatic registration” provision applies to those
                                                         officers, partners, and directors of the IA who are already IARs in at least one state.


                                        Important note: For those of you who have taken a FINRA exam, you know there is a
                                        supervisory level of registration—registered principal. No such gradations apply under
                                        NASAA rules. So, no matter how high ranking the officer of the investment advisory firm,
                                        that individual registers as an IAR. Therefore, anytime you see reference made to your
                                        supervisor, remember, that person is an IAR just like you.


                                        Testing
                                        Unless a waiver is granted (see Introduction), passing the Series 65 exam is a requirement
                                        for registration as an investment adviser representative. We do expect you to pass, but, if an
                                        applicant is not successful on the first or second attempt, there is a 30-day waiting period
                                        before the exam may be retaken. After the third (and subsequent) attempts, the waiting period
                                        is 180 days.

                                        Now that you know how to register, what about termination procedures?

                                    IAR Termination Procedures
                                    If an investment adviser representative terminates employment with an investment adviser,
                                    notification requirements depend on how the investment adviser is registered.

                                    If the investment adviser is a state-registered adviser, the firm must notify the Administrator.
                                    If the investment adviser is a federal covered adviser, the investment adviser representative
                                    must notify the Administrator. All notifications must be made promptly.

                                    A clue that might help is to visualize the “I” in IAR as the number “1” to remember that only
                                    one person gives notification. What is the story if the IAR leaves one firm to go to another?

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   Zack is an IAR with Unicorn Investment Advisers (UIA), an investment adviser
                                                   registered in State W. Zack has accepted an employment offer from Elite Research
                                                   Associates (ERA), an investment adviser also registered in State W. What are the
                                                   notification requirements to the State W Administrator?
                                                     A. Zack is the only person who notifies the Administrator.
                                                     B. UIA is the only person who notifies the Administrator.
                                                     C. ERA is the only person who notifies the Administrator.
                                                    D. UIA and ERA notify the Administrator.
                                                   Answer: D. This is bit sneaky. We’ve just told you to remember the “I” in IAR
                                                   resembles the number “1,” so only one person must notify. We’ve also stated that,
                                                   if the IAR represents a state-registered investment adviser, it is the IA who does the
                                                   notification. In this specific instance, because two IA firms are involved, each of them
                                                   must notify the Administrator: UIA that Zack is no longer under their control and ERA
                                                   that Zack now is. This is just an example of how every rule has an exception.


                                    Financial Requirements of IARs
                                    Unlike an investment adviser, there are no financial requirements—no net worth or
                                    bonding requirements—to register as an investment adviser representative. The fact that
                                    the IAR applicant must be solvent (not adjudicated bankrupt) is not considered a financial
                                    requirement.


                                    Recordkeeping Requirements of IARs
                                    Unlike an investment adviser, there are no ongoing recordkeeping requirements for IARs.
                                    Annual renewal on December 31 requires the payment of fees. If there are any material
                                    changes, especially of a disciplinary nature, the individual’s Form U4 must be updated within
                                    30 days.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              If there should be a change to any material information in Form U4 (e.g., change of
                                              permanent address or change to military status), an amendment must be filed within
                                              30 days.

                                                         Answer: A. Amendments are made to Form U4 and must be filed within 30 days.
                                                         Form U5 is for terminations.

             1. B Only individuals (natural persons) are eligible    1. D Section 202 of the Uniform Securities Act
                  to register as IARs. If the question simply             states that registration of an investment

                  adviser, the correct answer would have been all         of any investment adviser representative who
                  of the above.                                           is a partner, officer, or director, or a person

             INTRODUCTION
                                    We have already discussed two of the four securities professionals covered under the Uniform
                                    Securities Act (and federal law): investment advisers and those who represent them, investment
                                    adviser representatives. This unit will cover the other two: broker-dealers and those who
                                    represent them, agents.

          LESSON 11.1: WHO IS AND WHO IS NOT A BROKER-DEALER?
                                        LO 11.a Define a broker-dealer.

                                        When describing the exclusions from the definition of an investment adviser (Unit 9, LO 9.a),
                                        we gave a brief definition of a broker-dealer (BD). Let’s get into more detail.

                                        A broker-dealer is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the federal law regulating
                                        broker-dealers and their representatives) and in the USA as any person (think back to the
                                        broad definition we gave you at the beginning of Unit 9) engaged in the business of effecting
                                        transactions in securities for the accounts of others or for its own account. Any person (e.g., a
                                        securities firm, even one organized as a sole proprietorship) with an established place of business
                                        (an office) in the state that is in the business of buying and selling securities for the accounts of
                                        others (customers) and/or for its own proprietary account is a defined as a broker-dealer.

                                        In other words, broker-dealers are firms for which agents (registered representatives) work.
                                        They are firms that engage in securities transactions, such as sales and trading. When acting on
                                        behalf of their customers—that is, buying and selling securities for their clients’ accounts—
                                        broker-dealers act in an agency capacity. When broker-dealers buy and sell securities for their
                                        own accounts, called proprietary accounts, they act in a principal capacity as dealers. We’ll
                                        cover their activity in this regard in Unit 23.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    Individuals who buy and sell securities for their own accounts are not broker-dealers
                                                    because they are engaged in personal investment activity, not the business of buying
                                                    and selling securities for others. They are individual investors, not securities dealers.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    One of the roles of a broker-dealer is underwriting (distributing) shares of new securities
                                                    for issuers. When they do that, they generally earn a spread (the difference between
                                                    the public offering price and what they pay the issuer) or receive a commission on
                                                    the sales, which they then use to pay their agents who actually made the sales to the
                                                    clients. Previously, in Unit 8, we covered the registration and issuance of securities.



                                        LO 11.b Identify broker-dealer exclusions and exemptions under the
                                        Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Uniform Securities Act.


                                        Exclusions from the Definition of Broker-Dealer
                                        Broker-dealers are firms that buy and sell securities for others or themselves as a business.
                                        There are, however, many persons, legal and natural, that effect securities transactions that
                                        are excluded from the definition of broker-dealer for purposes of state regulation. Persons
                                        excluded from the definition of broker-dealer are:
                                         agents (those individuals who represent broker-dealers);
                                         issuers (those entities such as corporations and governments who raise money by issuing
                                           securities); and
                                         banks, savings institutions, and trust companies.

                                                                               Unit 11   Regulation of Broker-Dealers and Their Agents   229


                                    Today, most banks and other financial institutions engage in securities activities through
                                    broker-dealer subsidiaries of the bank holding company. The broker-dealer subsidiaries of
                                    banks are, as a result, not excluded from the definition of a broker-dealer and therefore
                                    subject to the same securities regulations as other broker-dealers. Keep in mind that formation

                                                                                                                                                Unit 11
                                    of these subsidiaries eliminates the need for the bank holding companies to register as
                                    broker-dealers. Their broker-dealer subsidiaries must, of course, register.
                                     Broker-dealers with no place of business in the state. This exclusion is very much like the
                                       one offered to investment advisers. States exclude from the definition of broker-dealer
                                       those broker-dealers that:
                                        –– have no place of business in the state and deal exclusively with the issuers of the
                                           securities involved in the transactions, other broker-dealers, and other financial
                                           institutions, such as banks, savings and loan associations, trust companies, insurance
                                           companies, investment companies, or employee benefit plans with assets of not less
                                           than $1 million ($1,000,000);
                                        –– have no place of business in the state but are licensed in a state where they have a
                                           place of business, and offer and sell securities in the state only with persons in the
                                           state who are existing customers and who are not residents of the state; or
                                        –– qualify under the snowbird rule—similar to the rule for investment advisers and their
                                           representatives, the USA also allows broker-dealers and their agents to do business
                                           with existing customers who are temporarily in a state to avoid unnecessary multiple
                                           registrations.

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              As long as your client has not changed their state of residence, there is no time limit.
                                              Many people, after a couple of years in the workforce, decide to get an MBA. If they
                                              go out of state to a resident program for a year or two, that does not mean they’ve
                                              changed their state of residence, but merely that they are not commuter students.
                                              Only when official residency is changed (new driver’s license or voter registration) does
                                              the 30-day rule apply.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              Unlike investment advisers and their IARs, there is no de minimis exemption for
                                              broker-dealers. That is, even if the BD does not maintain a place of business in the
                                              state, a single retail client means registration is required.


                                    State Exemptions from Registration as a Broker-Dealer
                                    Obviously, there was no internet when the Uniform Securities Act was written in 1956. As
                                    with other changes in the way we do business, NASAA has written Model Rules to update the
                                    regulatory scheme. A firm’s website, considered advertising, can be seen everywhere. Does that
                                    mean the firm has a place of business in the state? Without getting too technical, there are
                                    several requirements to ensure that the person is not deemed to be in the state:
                                     The communication clearly states that the person may only do business in this state if
                                       properly registered or exempt from registration.
                                     Any follow-up individualized responses with prospects in this state that involve either the
                                       effecting or attempting to effect transactions in securities, or the rendering of personalized
                                       investment advice for compensation, as may be, will not be made without compliance
                                       with state broker-dealer, investment adviser, agent, or IA representative registration
                                       requirements, or an applicable exemption or exclusion.

                                           the internet communication; and
                                         in disseminating information through the internet communication, the agent or IAR acts
                                           within the scope of the authority granted by the broker-dealer or investment adviser.

                                        What this basically means is that if you just generally advertise on the internet, you don’t have
                                        to be registered in the state. However, if you follow-up with advice (IAR) or offer securities
                                        (agent), you either have to register or find some kind of exemption.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    The exam focuses more on the exclusions from the definition of broker-dealer than on
                                                    the definition itself. Know these exclusions well.

                                                    EXAMPLE
                                                    This is an example of the exclusion from the definition of broker-dealer:
                                                    First Securities Corporation (FSC) is a broker-dealer registered in State A, the location
                                                    of its only office. One of their agents contacts a client who is currently on vacation in
                                                    State B and recommends the purchase of XYZ common stock. The client agrees and
                                                    purchases 100 shares of XYZ. Neither the broker-dealer nor the agent is registered in
                                                    State B. Is this a problem? What if the client enjoys being in State B to the extent that it
                                                    becomes his permanent residence?
                                                    When a broker-dealer has no place of business in a state and deals with an existing
                                                    client who is temporarily in that state, the USA does not define that entity as a
                                                    broker-dealer in the state. Therefore, FSC would not be required to register in State B,
                                                    and neither would any of its agents.
                                                    Things change, however, if the client becomes a resident of State B. Once that client’s
                                                    residence has officially changed, the relationship can only continue for a maximum
                                                    of 30 days. After that, both FSC and the agent would have to register in State B if they
                                                    wanted to keep the client. Let’s take the example one step further.
                                                    First Securities Corporation (FSC) is a broker-dealer registered in State A, the location
                                                    of its principal office. They have begun doing business in State B with the First Fidelity
                                                    Bank and Trust Company and open a small branch office in State B to service the
                                                    account. Which of the following statements is correct?
                                                    A. FSC does not need to register in State B because its only client is an institution.
                                                    B. FSC needs to register in State B because it has a place of business in the state.
                                                    C. Broker-dealers are only required to register in the state where their principal office is
                                                       located.
                                                    D. FSC would have to register in State B even if it didn’t have a place of business there.

                                              We learned that the USA excludes from the definition of broker-dealer a firm with no
                                              place of business in a state whose only clients are, among others, institutions, such
                                              as banks. That exclusion only applies when there is no place of business in the state;
                                              opening a small branch in State B voids that exclusion, so B is the correct answer. Even

                                                                                                                                                   Unit 11
                                              if there is no place of business in the state, if they have a single individual (called a
                                              retail client on the exam) who resides in the state, then registration is always required.


                                    Federal Exemptions from Registration as a Broker-Dealer
                                    A broker-dealer that conducts all of its business in one state is exempt from registration
                                    with the SEC. The exception provided for intrastate broker-dealer activity is very narrow. To
                                    qualify, all aspects of all transactions must be done within the borders of one state. This means
                                    that, without SEC registration, a broker-dealer cannot participate in any transaction executed
                                    on a national securities exchange. Intrastate broker-dealers register with the state in which
                                    they are located.

                                    This chart should help (the “you” here does not mean individuals like yourself—it is referring
                                    to the brokerage firm).

          LESSON 11.2: WHO IS AND WHO IS NOT AN AGENT?

                                        LO 11.c Define an agent.

                                        Agent means any individual, other than a broker-dealer, who represents a broker-dealer or
                                        issuer in effecting or attempting to effect purchases or sales of securities. As agents, they act,
                                        usually on a commission basis, on behalf of others. Other than on this exam, agents are often
                                        referred to as registered representatives, whether they sell registered securities or securities
                                        exempt from registration.

                                        The use of the term individual here is important. Only an individual (a natural person) can be
                                        an agent. A corporation, such as a brokerage firm, is not a natural person—it is a legal entity.
                                        The brokerage firm is the legal person (legal entity) that the agent (natural person) represents
                                        in securities transactions.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    As just mentioned, agent is the term used under state law, and that (or broker-dealer
                                                    agent) is the only term that will be used on the exam. However, unlike investment
                                                    adviser representatives, who register solely on a state level, almost all agents
                                                    representing broker-dealers register on both the state and federal level by taking both
                                                    a NASAA-sponsored exam and a FINRA exam.


                                        Definition: associated person. A person associated with a broker-dealer is any partner,
                                        officer, or director of the broker-dealer (or any individual performing similar functions) or
                                        any person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by the broker-dealer, including
                                        any employees of the broker-dealer, except that any person associated with a broker or dealer
                                        whose functions are solely clerical or ministerial shall not be included in the meaning of the
                                        term.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    Even “outside” directors or partners whose only connection to the firm is the
                                                    contribution of capital are considered associated persons of the broker-dealer. If that
                                                    is their only function, they are not required to register as agents.



                                        LO 11.d Identify agent exclusions and exemptions under the Uniform
                                        Securities Act.

                                        Clerical and administrative (sometimes referred to as ministerial) employees of a broker-dealer
                                        are generally not included in the definition of agent and, therefore, are not required to be
                                        registered. The logic for this exclusion from the definition should be obvious. Clerical and
                                        administrative employees do not effect securities transactions with the public. They attend to
                                        the administration of the broker-dealer as a business organization. Under these circumstances,
                                        they are like clerical employees of any other corporation. A testable fact is that if the
                                        broker-dealer they work for wishes to pay their employees, including this group, a year-end
                                        bonus based on company profits (not related to any individual’s sales efforts), it would be
                                        allowable and would not require registrations of the clerical personnel.

                                    The situation changes when administrative personnel take on securities-related functions.
                                    When they do so, they lose their exemption and must register as an agent.

                                               TAKE NOTE
                                               Secretaries and sales assistants are not agents if their activities are confined to                Unit 11
                                               administrative activities, including responding to an existing client’s request for a
                                               quote. However, if secretaries or sales assistants accept customer transactions or take
                                               orders over the phone, they are engaging in securities transactions and are subject to
                                               registration as agents.

                                               Cold callers working for a broker-dealer would be defined as an agent if they did
                                               any more than ask if clients wanted to receive information. For example, if they
                                               prequalified clients or suggested ways to receive more money for their stocks or
                                               bonds, they would be considered agents.
                                               As is customary in other industries, broker-dealers frequently hire summer interns. If
                                               these interns received any selling related compensation, such as $10 for each existing
                                               client solicited, they would be considered agents and would have to register.
                                               Basically, there is no way for an individual to represent a broker-dealer in a securities
                                               sales function without being an agent.

                                    Representing Issuers
                                    In many cases, individuals who represent issuers of securities are agents and therefore
                                    must register as such in the states in which they sell the issuers’ securities. When does
                                    something like this occur? In many cases, a local company is looking to raise some additional
                                    capital—something in the range of several million dollars. Instead of going through the
                                    normal investment banking procedure (and paying all of those fees and commissions to the
                                    investment bankers), the company (known under the USA as the issuer) either uses its own
                                    employees or hires an outside sales force to sell the new securities. In general, these individuals
                                    are required to register as agents of the issuer. There is an exception as follows:
                                     Individuals are excluded from the definition of agent and, therefore, are exempt from
                                       registration in a state when representing issuers in effecting transactions:
                                        –– in certain exempt securities (listed below),
                                        –– exempt from registration (exempt transactions), or
                                        –– with existing employees, partners, or directors of the issuer if no sales-related
                                           commission or other remuneration is paid or given directly or indirectly for soliciting
                                           any person in this state.


                                    Effecting Transactions in Exempt Securities
                                    Securities exempt from registration are called exempt securities. Although there are almost
                                    a dozen different securities that qualify for exemption under the Uniform Securities Act
                                    (discussed previously in Unit 8), an individual is excluded from the term agent only when
                                    that individual represents an issuer in effecting transactions for the following five categories of
                                    exempt securities:

                                        Effecting Exempt Transactions
                                        An employee of an issuer is not an agent when representing an issuer in exempt transactions.
                                        Transactions exempt from registration are called exempt transactions. Some examples are:
                                         unsolicited brokerage transactions;
                                         transactions between the issuer and underwriters;

                                         private placements
                                        Exempt securities and exempt transactions were covered in thorough detail in Unit 8, so you
                                        will probably want to go back and review that information after this.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    An employee of an issuer is not an agent when representing an issuer if the issue
                                                    is exempt from registration, as long as it is one of the five exemptions listed above.
                                                    Alternatively, the employee is not an agent when representing an issuer in exempt
                                                    transactions (e.g., transactions between an underwriter and issuer).
                                                    An individual employed by a corporation (not a broker-dealer) to sell a new IPO to the
                                                    public would be considered an agent of the issuer needing registration, even if not
                                                    paid compensation based on sales. The only exception would be if all transactions
                                                    were exempt, such as selling the shares only to institutional investors.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    Keep in mind that an individual who works for an issuer of securities is excluded
                                                    from the definition of agent when engaging in transactions with employees involving
                                                    the issuer’s securities, provided that the individual is not compensated for such
                                                    participation by commissions or other remuneration based either directly or indirectly
                                                    on the amount of securities sold. In other words, salaried employees engaged in
                                                    distributing their employers’ shares as part of an employee benefit plan would not
                                                    be required to register as agents because they are, by definition, excluded from the
                                                    definition. If such employees were compensated on the basis of the number of shares
                                                    sold, they would be defined as agents and therefore would be subject to registration.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              Individuals representing broker-dealers in a sales capacity must register as agents
                                              whether they sell registered securities or securities exempt from registration or engage
                                              in exempt transactions.

                                                                                                                                                 Unit 11
                                    Agent Exemptions from Registration
                                    Just as with broker-dealers, there is no de minimis exemption for agents. If you have a single
                                    client in a state, regardless of whether or not you have a place of business there, you are an
                                    agent in that state and require registration.

                                    There are only two exemptions. First is the snowbird exemption we’ve discussed several times
                                    before. The second is when the firm is excluded from the definition of BD because it has no
                                    place of business in the state and only deals with other broker-dealers and institutions. In
                                    that case, the BD’s employees who service those clients are not considered to be agents in that
                                    state.

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   Under the Uniform Securities Act, which of the following would be considered an
                                                   agent?
                                                    A. An individual employed by a small community bank for the purpose of selling
                                                       stock in the bank
                                                    B. A broker-dealer with a place of business in the state with an extensive retail
                                                       clientele
                                                    C. An individual whose broker-dealer is registered in the state, but her only clients
                                                       are institutions
                                                    D. An individual with no place of business in the state dealing with more than five
                                                       existing clients who are vacationing in the state
                                                   Answer: C. Even though the individual’s only clients are institutions, the fact that her
                                                   BD is registered in the state means she must register as well. Yes, transactions with
                                                   institutions are exempt transactions, but that exemption only applies to individuals
                                                   selling on behalf of the issuer, not when representing a broker-dealer. Individuals
                                                   selling the securities of certain exempt issuers (like a bank) are excluded from the
                                                   definition, as are broker-dealers. If the individual has no place of business in the state
                                                   and only deals with existing clients (regardless of the number) who are temporarily in
                                                   the state, that individual is exempt from registration.


                                    Remember, we learned earlier in this unit that broker-dealers with no place of business in the
                                    state, dealing exclusively with other broker-dealers or institutional clients, are not considered
                                    to be BDs in the state (as long as they are properly registered in at least one state—the
                                    location of their principal office). Let’s apply that to the following situation.

                                    ABC Securities is a broker-dealer registered in State A. It has no place of business in State
                                    B, but it does effect transactions on behalf of a number of banks and insurance companies
                                    located in State B. Therefore, it is not considered a BD in State B and is exempt from
                                    registering. Should ABC Securities sell some government securities to these clients, neither
                                    ABC nor the agents making the sale are required to be registered. This is not because the
                                    government securities are exempt (that just means that they don’t have to register with
                                    the Administrator), but because, under the USA, ABC does not meet the definition of a
                                    broker-dealer in State B.

                                        However, should ABC decide to have any of its agents sell these government bonds to
                                        individual (sometimes referred to as retail) clients in State B, then even though the bonds are
                                        exempt securities, both ABC and the selling agents must register in that state.

                                        The same applies to exempt transactions. One of the most common cases is when a client calls
                                        an agent to purchase a security that is not exempt and not registered in the agent’s state. But,
                                        because the transaction has been initiated by the client, as an unsolicited trade, it is an exempt
                                        transaction and, therefore, the trade may be made even though the security is not registered.

                                        One way the exam will try to trick you is by asking about an individual calling an agent from
                                        a state in which the agent is not registered. The broker-dealer is registered in that state, and
                                        the individual is a client of the firm, but not of that particular agent. The individual wishes to
                                        enter an unsolicited order—can the agent accept it? No! Although the transaction is exempt
                                        (which only means that the security does not have to be registered in that state), an agent can
                                        only do business with a resident of a state if the agent is properly licensed in that state. In this
                                        case, the agent would have to turn the order over to an agent who is licensed in that other
                                        state.

          LESSON 11.3: REGISTRATION AND POST-REGISTRATION
          REQUIREMENTS OF BROKER-DEALERS AND AGENTS
                                        LO 11.e Describe the initial and post-registration requirements of
                                        the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Uniform Securities Act
                                        regarding broker-dealers.

                                        Under the USA, if a person is included in the definition of a broker-dealer, that person
                                        must register as a broker-dealer in the states where it does business. The USA is clear about
                                        broker-dealer registration. It states, “It is unlawful for any person to transact business in this
                                        state as a broker-dealer . . . unless he is registered under this Act.”

                                        This means every person (legal entity) that falls within the definition of a broker-dealer must
                                        register with the Administrator of the state. Again, keep in mind that if a person falls under
                                        one of the exclusions from the definition, that person or legal entity does not have to register
                                        in the state. The rules are basically the same for agents.

                                                                               Unit 11   Regulation of Broker-Dealers and Their Agents   237


                                    In most jurisdictions, registration is accomplished by filing the SEC’s Form BD modified
                                    to meet the needs of the state. If any material information on the BD becomes inaccurate,
                                    prompt notice must be given to the Administrator.

                                    While the exam will focus on state registration requirements, you need to know that almost
                                    all broker-dealers register with the SEC. That means that unlike investment advisers, who only                Unit 11
                                    register with one regulator, you can assume that any broker-dealer referred to in a question
                                    (unless something tells you otherwise) registers with the SEC and at least one state.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              The “automatic” registration of officers, etc., that we discussed with regard to
                                              investment advisers applies here as well. And, as mentioned before, unlike FINRA,
                                              there is no separate principal registration, so these individuals are registered as agents.


                                    Submitting an Application
                                    All persons must complete and submit an initial application (as well as renewals) to the state
                                    securities Administrator. For broker-dealers, the application is Form BD. The application
                                    must contain whatever information the Administrator may require by rule, and will include:
                                     form and place of business;
                                     proposed method of doing business;
                                     a list of all jurisdictions in which the applicant is registering (or already registered);
                                     qualifications and business history (broker-dealers must include the qualifications and
                                       history of partners, officers, directors, and other persons with controlling influence over
                                       the organization);
                                     court-issued injunctions and administrative orders;
                                     adjudications by the SEC or any securities SRO (self-regulatory organization, such as
                                       FINRA) within the past 10 years;
                                     convictions of misdemeanors involving a security or any aspect of the securities business
                                       (including charges as well as convictions);
                                     felony convictions, whether securities related or not (including charges as well as
                                       convictions);
                                     financial condition and history (but only of the firm—no credit reports on the officers);
                                       and
                                     any current unsatisfied liens and judgments as well as any declaration of bankruptcy
                                       within the past 10 years.

                                    The Administrator also may require that an applicant publish an announcement of the
                                    registration in one or more newspapers in the state.


                                    Payment of Initial and Renewal Filing Fees
                                    States require filing fees for initial applications as well as for renewal applications. If an
                                    application is withdrawn or denied, the Administrator is entitled to retain a portion of the
                                    fee. Filing fees for broker-dealers, investment advisers, and their representatives need not be
                                    identical. As was the case with investment advisers, a registered broker-dealer may file an
                                    application for registration of a successor, whether or not the successor is then in existence,
                                    for the unexpired portion of the year. There is no filing or registration fee until renewal

                                        (December 31) of the firm’s license, but the successor firm would have to file a new consent to
                                        service of process.

                                        As described previously, under normal circumstances, registration becomes effective for all
                                        securities professionals at noon of the 30th day after filing. In the case of agents (or IARs),
                                        the Administrator will notify the employing firm of effectiveness, and they will tell the new
                                        registrants when they are “good to go.” By rule or by order, the Administrator may authorize
                                        an earlier effective date of licensing. In other words, there could be an occasion where, in
                                        effect, a person was the subject of a rush order.

                                        Once registered, broker-dealers are subject to numerous administrative requirements to keep
                                        their registrations current and in good order.


                                        Books and Records
                                        Every registered broker-dealer must make and keep such accounts, blotters (records of original
                                        entry), correspondence (including emails), memoranda, papers, books, and other records as
                                        the state Administrator by rule prescribes. All records so required shall be maintained and
                                        preserved in an easily accessible place for a period of not less than three years from the end
                                        of the fiscal year during which the last entry was made on record, the first two years in the
                                        principal office of the broker-dealer.

                                        These records must be current, complete, and accurate. Broker-dealers are obligated
                                        to promptly file correcting amendments. State securities Administrators cannot impose
                                        recordkeeping requirements that are in excess of those prescribed by the SEC. Please review
                                        LO 9.g to see the allowable methods of records storage. The records broker-dealers are
                                        required to maintain are subject to periodic, special, or other examinations by representatives
                                        of the Administrator of the state where the broker-dealer’s principal office is located or of any
                                        other state in which the broker-dealer is registered as the Administrator deems necessary or
                                        appropriate in the public interest.

                                                    Included in the recordkeeping requirements are electronic communications,
                                                    particularly emails. However, it is not required to maintain emails of a personal nature
                                                    sent to nonclients (e.g., “Honey, I’m stuck at the office and will be late for dinner”).

                                                    Although it is required to keep all records relating to customers, there are no
                                                    requirements to keep copies of their tax returns.


                                        Financial Requirements for Broker-Dealers
                                        The Administrator may establish net capital requirements for broker-dealers. Net capital
                                        requirements of the states may not exceed those required by federal law—in this case,
                                        the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Administrator of a state may require those
                                        broker-dealers that have custody of, or discretionary authority over, clients’ funds or securities
                                        to post surety bonds. Just as with net capital, the amount of surety bonds required by the
                                        states is limited to the amount set by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. No bond may
                                        be required of any broker-dealer whose net capital exceeds the amounts required by the
                                        Administrator.

                                    Stated simply, when it comes to broker-dealers, regardless of how many states in which they
                                    are registered, other than enforcing antifraud statutes, the Administrator has relinquished
                                    most control to the SEC.

                                    LO 11.f Describe the initial and post-registration requirements of
                                    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Uniform Securities Act
                                    regarding agents.

                                    Before we continue, there is an important term found in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
                                    that needs to be defined: statutory disqualification.

                                    Because the Exchange Act deals with the registration of persons (the “people” act), the SEC
                                    sets forth certain actions making a person disqualified under statute (law) from becoming
                                    registered or associated with a broker-dealer or investment adviser. The person is subject to a
                                    statutory disqualification if that person:
                                     has been or is expelled or suspended from membership or being associated with a member
                                       of any SRO (think FINRA);
                                     is subject to an order of the SEC or other appropriate regulatory agency (think the
                                       Administrator) denying, suspending, or revoking his registration as a broker-dealer, or
                                       barring or suspending his association with a broker or dealer;
                                     by his conduct while associated with a broker-dealer, has been found to be a cause of any
                                       effective suspension, expulsion, or order of the type described in the two points above;
                                     has been convicted within the past 10 years of a securities violation or a misdemeanor
                                       involving finance or dishonesty, bribery, embezzlement, forgery, theft, and so forth, or
                                       any felony;
                                     is subject to a temporary or permanent injunction from a competent court of jurisdiction
                                       prohibiting him from engaging in any phase of the securities business;
                                     has willfully violated any federal securities law; or
                                     has made a false or misleading statement in any filing with information requested by an
                                       SRO (omitting important facts is a cause as well).

          240        Unit 11    Regulation of Broker-Dealers and Their Agents



                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    Loss of a civil lawsuit, even one involving securities, is not a cause for statutory
                                                    disqualification

                                        The registration requirements for an agent who is not exempt are similar to those for a
                                        broker-dealer. An application, generally Form U4, must be completed. Two things, however,
                                        that are on the agent’s application that do not apply to a broker-dealer are disclosing
                                        citizenship and employment history.

                                        The USA states, “It is unlawful for any person to transact business in this state as an agent
                                        unless he is registered under this act.” In other words, an individual may not conduct
                                        securities transactions in a state unless that person is properly registered in the state where
                                        he conducts business. This is true even when receiving unsolicited orders. If an agent does
                                        business in a state, she must be registered in that state, even if there is only one client. This
                                        is not like investment advisers and their representatives, who enjoy a de minimis exemption.
                                        So, what can an individual who has been hired to become an agent of a broker-dealer do
                                        while registration is pending? After all, one does not fill out Form U4 and become an agent
                                        immediately. Permitted activities would be those allowed to any other employee of the
                                        broker-dealer who is not required to be registered. That would include clerical functions,
                                        such as posting trade details to client accounts, or administrative activities like assisting with
                                        research. As long as it does not involve customer contact relating to selling/offering securities
                                        or opening accounts, these “newbies” can hang around the office and try to make themselves
                                        useful. Of course, most of their time should be spent preparing to pass the exam.

                                        An agent’s registration is not effective during any period when the agent is not associated
                                        with a broker-dealer registered in the state. Therefore, if the broker-dealer’s registration is
                                        terminated, the agent is no longer considered licensed. The terminology depends on the
                                        specific state. In some cases, the agent’s license is placed in suspense. In other states, it is put on
                                        hold or similar language. Whatever the phrase, when the broker-dealer closes up shop, either
                                        voluntarily or involuntarily (think revocation of registration by the Administrator), the agent
                                        cannot function because there is no broker-dealer affiliation. This is also true of an investment
                                        adviser representative when the investment adviser’s registration is terminated.

                                        One place where IARs and agents differ is in their termination notice procedures. When an
                                        agent begins or terminates a connection with a broker-dealer or issuer, or begins or terminates
                                        those activities that make him an agent, the agent and the broker-dealer or issuer must
                                        promptly notify the Administrator.
                                        1. IAs register on the federal level (SEC) or state level, never both.
                                        2. IARs only register on the state level.
                                        3. BDs register on the federal level (through FINRA) and the state level.
                                        4. Agents register on the federal level (through FINRA) and the state level.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    If an agent terminates employment with a broker-dealer, both parties must notify the
                                                    Administrator promptly. If an agent terminates employment with one broker-dealer
                                                    to join another broker-dealer, all three parties must notify the Administrator. One
                                                    way to remember this is that in the case of an agent, the first letter, A, tells us that All
                                                    the parties involved must notify the Administrator. All notifications must be made
                                                    promptly. Please note how this differs from the termination of an IAR.

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   The City of Chicago issues bonds for the maintenance of local recreational facilities.
                                                   Purchasers have two choices: they can purchase the bonds directly from the city
                                                   through Ms. Stith (an employee of the city responsible for selling the bonds), or

                                                                                                                                                  Unit 11
                                                   they can purchase them from Mr. Thompson (an employee of First Allied Securities
                                                   Corporation). Neither Ms. Stith nor Mr. Thompson charges a commission, although
                                                   FASC is remunerated with an underwriting fee. It would be correct to state that
                                                     A. Ms. Stith and Mr. Thompson must be registered as agents.
                                                    B. Ms. Stith must be registered as an agent, but Mr. Thompson is excluded.
                                                    C. Mr. Thompson must be registered as an agent, but Ms. Stith is excluded.
                                                    D. Mr. Thompson and Ms. Stith are excluded from the definition of agent.
                                                   Answer: C. Any individual selling securities while representing a registered
                                                   broker-dealer is always defined as an agent, even when the securities are exempt
                                                   from registration (as are these municipal bonds). When an individual represents
                                                   the issuer of certain exempt securities, such as municipal bonds, that individual is
                                                   excluded from the definition of agent and does not register. This means the correct
                                                   answer is C. It is important to remember the five categories of exempt issuers to
                                                   which this exclusion applies.

                                    Exemptions from registration as an agent generally apply to representatives of issuers rather
                                    than to representatives of broker-dealers.


                                    Financial Requirements of Agents
                                    There are no financial requirements, or net worth requirements, to register as an agent. The
                                    Administrator may, however, require an agent to be bonded, particularly if the agent has
                                    discretion over a client’s account.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              Please note that, unlike FINRA registration requirements, individuals applying for
                                              registration do not have to submit fingerprints.


                                    Multiple Registrations
                                    An individual may not act at any one time as an agent for more than one broker-dealer or
                                    for more than one issuer, unless the broker-dealers or issuers for whom the agent acts are
                                    affiliated by direct or indirect common control or the Administrator grants an exception. In
                                    the event an agent does wish to affiliate with a second broker-dealer, the agent would have to
                                    go through the registration process with the second firm in the same manner as the original
                                    application (filing another Form U4).


                                    Limited Registration of Canadian Broker-Dealers and Agents
                                    Provided the limited registration requirements noted below are met, a broker-dealer domiciled
                                    in Canada that has no office in a given state may effect transactions in securities with or for or
                                    attempt to induce the purchase or sale of any security by:
                                     a person from Canada who is temporarily a resident in this state who was already a client
                                       of the broker-dealer; or
                                     a person from Canada who is a resident in this state, whose transaction is in a self-directed,
                                       tax-advantaged retirement plan in Canada of which the person is the holder or contributor.
                                       In Canada, the equivalent of an IRA is called a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP).

                                        An agent who will be representing a Canadian broker-dealer who registers under these
                                        provisions may effect transactions in securities in this state on the same basis as permitted for
                                        the broker-dealer.

                                        For the Canadian broker-dealer to register in this fashion, it must:
                                         file an application in the form required by the jurisdiction where it has its principal office
                                           in Canada;
                                         register in each of the states where it is serving customers;
                                         file a consent to service of process;
                                         provide evidence that it is registered in good standing in its home jurisdiction; and
                                         be a member of an SRO or stock exchange in Canada.
                                        Requirements for agents are the same, except that membership in an SRO or stock exchange is
                                        not relevant.

                                        However, just as with domestic broker-dealers, if there is no place of business in the state,
                                        there are no registration requirements if the only securities transactions are with issuers, other
                                        broker-dealers, and institutional clients.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    Renewal applications for Canadian broker-dealers and agents who file for limited
                                                    registration must be filed before December 1 each year.


                                        Comparing the Four Securities Professionals
                                        In our many years of preparing applicants for this exam, one thing we have observed is that
                                        many students do not have a clear idea of the difference between a broker-dealer and an
                                        investment adviser and, similarly, between an agent and an investment adviser representative.
                                        Perhaps the following will help:

             INTRODUCTION
                                    This unit addresses the administrative provisions of the act and the remedies available to the
                                    Administrator. Under the Uniform Securities Act, the state Administrator has jurisdiction over
                                    securities transactions that originate in, are directed into, or are accepted in the Administrator’s
                                    state.
                                    When a securities transaction falls within the Administrator’s jurisdiction, the Administrator
                                    has the power to make rules and orders; conduct investigations and issue subpoenas; issue cease
                                    and desist orders; and deny, suspend, or revoke registrations. Both civil liabilities and criminal
                                    penalties exist for violating the act.

          LESSON 12.1: AUTHORITY OF THE STATE SECURITIES ADMINISTRATOR
                                        The jurisdiction and powers of the Administrator extend to activities related to securities
                                        transactions originated in the state, directed to the state, or accepted in the state. Securities
                                        transactions involve an offer and a sale, so we need to know what those terms mean, and then
                                        we can focus on the Administrator’s jurisdiction.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    The SEC’s authority does not extend over state securities regulation (the Uniform
                                                    Securities Act).

                                        The USA defines offer or offer to sell as every attempt or offer to dispose of, or solicitation
                                        of an offer to buy, a security or interest in a security for value. For test purposes, you should
                                        know that:
                                         any security given or delivered with, or as a bonus on account of, a purchase of securities
                                           or anything else (a car, jewelry, and so forth) is considered to constitute part of the subject
                                           of the purchase and to have been offered and sold for value;
                                         a purported gift of assessable stock is considered to involve an offer and a sale (assessable
                                           stock is stock issued below par for which the issuer or creditors have the right to assess
                                           shareholders for the balance of unpaid par); and
                                         every sale or offer of a warrant or right to purchase or subscribe to another security of the
                                           same or another issuer, as well as every sale or offer of a security which gives the holder a
                                           present or future right or privilege to convert into another security of the same or another
                                           issuer, is considered to include an offer of the other security.

                                        If a car dealer, as an essential part of a car sale, offers $1,000 in corporate bonds as an
                                        incentive, this would be considered a bonus under the act and, therefore, this now becomes a
                                        securities sale and falls under the jurisdiction of the state securities Administrator. As a result,
                                        to do this, and I know it is hard to believe, the car dealer would have to register with the state
                                        as a broker-dealer.


                                        Sale or Sell
                                        The USA defines sale or sell as every contract of sale, contract to sell, and disposition of a
                                        security or interest in a security for value. This means that any transfer of a security in which
                                        money or some other valuable consideration is involved is covered by this definition and
                                        subject to the act.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    You must be able to distinguish between a sale and an offer to sell. The offer is
                                                    the attempt; a transaction has not taken place. In a sale, there has been an actual
                                                    transaction involving money or another form of consideration for value. One must be
                                                    properly registered to make both the offer and then the sale.

                                    Gifts of Assessable Stock
                                    When assessable stock is given as a gift, the Administrator has jurisdiction over the transaction
                                    because there is a potential future obligation in that either the issuer or, more likely, creditors
                                    can demand payment for the balance of the par value.

                                               TAKE NOTE
                                               If an individual owned assessable stock and felt that the issuer was on the verge of
                                               bankruptcy, that person could give the stock as a present. If the bankruptcy occurred,
                                               the new owner would then be subject to the assessment.

                                               TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                               Assessable stock no longer exists, but the exam may ask about it. Look for this

                                                                                                                                                  Unit 12
                                               considered to involve an offer and sale.”


                                    Exclusions from the Definition of Sale/Sell and Offer/Offer to Sell
                                    The terms sale or sell and offer or offer to sell do not include any:
                                     bona fide pledge or loan (pledging stock as collateral for a loan, such as for a loan at the
                                       bank, is not a sale; you expect to get your stock back when the loan is paid off—you
                                       haven’t sold it);
                                     gift of nonassessable stock (this is the way all stocks are today);
                                     stock dividend, whether the corporation distributing the dividend is the issuer of the
                                       stock or not, if nothing of value is given by stockholders for the dividend (and this would
                                       include stock splits);
                                     class vote by stockholders, pursuant to the certificate of incorporation or the applicable
                                       corporation statute, or a merger, consolidation, reclassification of securities, or sale of
                                       corporate assets in consideration of the issuance of securities of another corporation; or
                                     act incident to a judicially approved reorganization with which a security is issued in
                                       exchange for one or more outstanding securities, claims, or property interest, or partly in
                                       such exchange and partly for cash.

                                               TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                               Because you have just learned that the gift of nonassessable stock is not considered
                                               a sale, you have to be careful not to be tricked by a question on the exam in which
                                               shares of nonassessable stock are given free as a bonus with the purchase of
                                               something else (e.g., a security, a car, a house). This would not be a gift and would, in
                                               fact, be an offer or a sale.


                                    Legal Jurisdiction of the Administrator
                                    Under law, for any agent of a state (e.g., the Administrator) to have authority over an activity
                                    such as a sale or offer of securities, he must have legal jurisdiction to act. Jurisdiction under
                                    the USA specifically means the legal authority to regulate securities activities that take place in
                                    the state.

                                        The USA describes activities considered to have taken place in the state as any offer to buy or
                                        sell a security, as well as any acceptance of the offer, if the offer:
                                         originated in the Administrator’s state;
                                         is directed to the Administrator’s state; or
                                         is accepted in the Administrator’s state.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    Because securities transactions often involve several states, more than one
                                                    Administrator may have jurisdiction over a security or a transaction.

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTIONS
                                                         Let’s work through some practice questions to see how this might appear on your
                                                         exam.

                                                    1.   Jane is an agent registered in States A and B. While sitting in her office in State A, she
                                                         contacts a client who lives in State B with a recommendation to buy ABC stock. The
                                                         client agrees to make the purchase. Jurisdiction here would belong to
                                                           A. the State A Administrator.
                                                          B. the State B Administrator.
                                                          C. both the State A and State B Administrators.
                                                          D. neither Administrator because this is an existing client.
                                                         Answer: C. In this case, it would be the Administrators of both States A and B. Why is
                                                         that? Remember that the Administrator has jurisdiction over any offer that originated
                                                         in his state, and clearly this offer originated from Jane in State A. Recall that the
                                                         Administrator has jurisdiction over any offer that was accepted in his state, and this
                                                         client who accepted the offer lives in State B. The status of the client, existing or
                                                         prospective, does not affect the Administrator’s jurisdiction.

                                                         Let’s take a look at another possible question:

                                                    2.   Jane has another State A–based client, Sally, who spends the winters in State C, a
                                                         state where neither Jane nor her broker-dealer have a place of business or any retail
                                                         clients. Jane sends Sally a research report with a strong buy recommendation for XYZ
                                                         stock. Sally calls Jane with an order to purchase 100 shares of XYZ. Jurisdiction over
                                                         this transaction belongs to
                                                           A. the State A Administrator.
                                                           B. the State C Administrator.
                                                           C. both the State A and State B Administrators.
                                                          D. both the State A and State C Administrators.
                                                         Answer: D. Just as with the previous question, we have an offer being made from
                                                         State A resulting in that Administrator having jurisdiction. Although the client lives in
                                                         State A, the offer was accepted while she was in State C, so the State C Administrator
                                                         has jurisdiction.

                                        Although not related to the issue of jurisdiction, for review purposes, we should ask ourselves,
                                        “Can this transaction legally take place?” Jane is not registered in State C—how can she make
                                        the offer to a client who is there, and how can she (and her broker-dealer) accept a retail order
                                        when neither of them are registered in State C? As noted in Unit 11, a broker-dealer with no
                                        place of business in a state who deals with existing clients (such as Sally) who are temporarily
                                        in the state (as Sally is) is not defined as a broker-dealer in that state and, therefore, does not
                                        register (nor do their agents).

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              The Administrator’s authority does not stop at the state line. The Administrator of any
                                              state where the registrant is registered may demand an inspection during reasonable
                                              business hours with whatever frequency the Administrator deems necessary.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              To avoid unnecessary duplication of examinations, the Administrator may cooperate
                                              with the securities administrators of other states, the SEC, and any national securities
                                              exchange or national securities association registered under the Securities Exchange
                                              Act of 1934.


                                    Publishing and Broadcast Exceptions to Jurisdiction
                                    There are special rules regarding the Administrator’s jurisdiction over offers made through a

                                                                                                                                                Unit 12
                                    TV or radio broadcast or a bona fide newspaper.

                                    The Administrator would not have jurisdiction if the offer were made under any of the
                                    following circumstances:
                                     Television or radio broadcast that originated outside of the state
                                     Bona fide newspaper or periodical published outside of the state
                                     Newspaper or periodical published inside the state but with more than two-thirds (66%)
                                       of its circulation outside the state in the last year

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              A bona fide newspaper is a newspaper of general interest and circulation, such as
                                              The New York Times. Private investment advisory newsletters, usually distributed by
                                              subscription, are not bona fide newspapers and therefore are not included in the
                                              publishing exception.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              A radio or television program is considered to originate in the state where the
                                              microphone or television camera is located.

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  Wayne and Grayson, Ltd., is a broker-dealer with offices in Gotham, New Jersey. They
                                                  place an ad for a new securities issue in the Gotham Gazette. Approximately 55% of
                                                  the Gazette’s readership is in Delaware. Under the Uniform Securities Act, jurisdiction
                                                  over this ad would lie with
                                                    A. the Administrator of New Jersey.
                                                   B. the Administrator of Delaware.
                                                   C. the Administrators of both New Jersey and Delaware.

                                                         Answer: A. Although more than half the readers of the Gazette live in Delaware,
                                                         under the terms of the publishing and broadcasting exemption of the USA, the
                                                         offer is not made in Delaware because the paper is not published there. Therefore,
                                                         the Administrator of New Jersey has sole jurisdiction over the offering. No dual or
                                                         multiple jurisdiction applies in this case, unless the offer is actually accepted in
                                                         Delaware. What would the answer be if the question stated that more than 2⁄3 of the
                                                         circulation was outside of New Jersey? Once that happens, believe it or not, no state
                                                         has jurisdiction.


                                                    KNOWLEDGE CHECK 12.1
                                                    1.   A state’s securities Administrator has jurisdiction over a securities offering if
                                                            I. the security was registered in that state.
                                                           II. it originated in that state.
                                                          III. it was accepted in that state.
                                                          IV. the broker-dealer is registered in that state.
                                                           A. I and II
                                                           B. I and IV
                                                           C. II and III
                                                           D. III and IV
                                                    2.   An Administrator has jurisdiction over an offer to sell securities if it was made in a
                                                         newspaper published within the state with no more than
                                                          A. one-third of its circulation outside the state.
                                                          B. one-half of its circulation outside the state.
                                                          C. two-thirds of its circulation outside the state.
                                                          D. 90% of its circulation outside the state.


          LESSON 12.2: ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS
                                        LO 12.b Identify the administrative actions that may be taken by the
                                        Administrator.

                                        The USA not only establishes the jurisdiction of the Administrator but also outlines the
                                        powers or the actions that the Administrator can take within its jurisdiction. The four broad
                                        powers the Administrator has to enforce and administer the act in his state are to:
                                         make, amend, or rescind rules and orders and require the use of specific forms;
                                         conduct investigations and issue subpoenas;
                                         issue cease and desist orders and seek injunctions; and
                                         deny, suspend, cancel, or revoke registrations and licenses.
                                        Because the Administrator has the power to enforce the act for the benefit of the public, the
                                        Administrator, as well as his employees, has an obligation not to use the office for personal
                                        gain. Administrators are, as a result, prohibited from using for their own benefit any
                                        information derived from their official duties that has not been made public.

                                                                                     Unit 12   Remedies and Administrative Provisions   253


                                    Rules, Orders, and Forms
                                    To enforce the USA, the Administrator has the authority to make, amend, or rescind
                                    rules, forms, and orders necessary to administer the act. The Administrator may also issue
                                    interpretive letters. The USA requires that all rules and forms be published. Rules and orders
                                    of the Administrator have the same authority as provisions of the act itself, but these rules and
                                    orders are not part of the USA itself. The difference between a rule and an order is that a rule
                                    applies to everyone, whereas an order applies to a specific instance.

                                               EXAMPLE
                                               The Administrator may decide to issue a rule requiring all agents to pay an annual
                                               registration fee of $250. This rule applies to everyone. Or the Administrator may
                                               find that a specific agent has violated a provision of the law and order a 30-day
                                               suspension. This order applies only to that particular agent.

                                    Although the Administrator has the power to make and amend rules for compliance with her                    Unit 12
                                    state’s blue-sky law, she does not have the power to alter the law itself.

                                    The composition or content of state securities law is the responsibility of the state legislature,
                                    not of administrative agencies. Rules for administration and compliance with the law are the
                                    responsibility of the securities Administrator.

                                               EXAMPLE        Rules and Orders of the Administrator
                                               Situation: The Administrator of State R requires by rule that all companies registering
                                               their securities in State R must supply financial statements in a specific form and with
                                               content prescribed by the Administrator. However, the Administrator does not publish
                                               the rule because the rule is too long and complex.
                                               Analysis: The USA allows state Administrators to issue rules and orders in carrying out
                                               their regulatory functions, and the State R Administrator acted properly in designing
                                               the form and content for financial reports. However, it is required by the USA that
                                               Administrators publish all rules and orders. The Administrator, despite the latitude
                                               given him in administering the USA, cannot suspend any provision of the USA itself.
                                               The State R Administrator acted within his authority in designing the forms but acted
                                               without authority—that is, he violated the USA—by suspending the requirement that
                                               all rules and orders be published.


                                    Conduct Investigations and Issue Subpoenas
                                    The Administrator has broad discretionary authority to conduct investigations and issue
                                    subpoenas. These investigations may be made in public or in private and may occur within or
                                    outside of the Administrator’s state. Normally, these investigations are open to the public, but
                                    when, in the opinion of the Administrator and with the consent of all parties, it is felt that a
                                    private investigation is more appropriate, that investigation will be conducted without public
                                    scrutiny.

                                        In conducting an investigation, the Administrator, or any officer designated by him, has the
                                        power to:
                                         require statements in writing, under oath, as to all matters relating to the issue under
                                           investigation;
                                         publish and make public the facts and circumstances concerning the issue to be
                                           investigated;
                                         subpoena witnesses and compel their attendance and testimony; and
                                         take evidence and require the production of books, papers, correspondence, and any other
                                           documents deemed relevant.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    If the Administrator of State A wishes to investigate a BD registered in State A but
                                                    whose principal office is located in State B, does he need the approval of the State
                                                    B Administrator? No! When can he go in? The Administrator can go in during normal
                                                    business hours and doesn’t need to make an appointment.

                                        So, what happens if a person who is the subject of an investigation refuses to furnish the
                                        required evidence or just ignores the subpoena? After all, the Administrator is not a police
                                        officer—he doesn’t wear a badge and cannot arrest anyone. There is a legal term that describes
                                        this type of disobedience. That term is contumacy, and here is what the USA says about that:

                                        “In case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpoena issued to, any person, the Administrator may
                                        apply to the appropriate court in his state and ask for help. Upon application by the Administrator,
                                        the court can issue an order to the person requiring him to appear before the Administrator, or
                                        the officer designated by him, to produce documentary evidence if so ordered or to give evidence
                                        touching the matter under investigation or in question. Failure to obey the order of the court may
                                        be punished by the court as a contempt of court.”

                                        Contempt of court can, of course, lead to jail time.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    In addition to having the power to conduct investigations, the Administrator may
                                                    enforce subpoenas issued by Administrators in other states on the same basis as if
                                                    the alleged offense took place in the Administrator’s state. However, the Administrator
                                                    may issue and apply to enforce subpoenas in his state at the request of a securities
                                                    agency or Administrator of another state only if the activities constituting an alleged
                                                    violation for which the information is sought would be a violation of the USA if the
                                                    activities had occurred in his state.


                                        Issue Cease and Desist Orders
                                        Whenever it appears to the Administrator that any person has engaged or is about to engage
                                        in any act or practice constituting a violation of any provision of this act or any rule or order
                                        hereunder, she may in her discretion bring either or both of the following remedies:
                                         issue a cease and desist order, with or without a prior hearing, against the person or
                                           persons engaged in the prohibited activities, directing them to cease and desist from
                                           further illegal activity; or
                                         bring an action in the appropriate court to obtain enforcement of the order through the
                                           issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction. If necessary, the court may appoint a
                                           receiver or conservator for the defendant or the defendant’s assets.

                                                                                     Unit 12   Remedies and Administrative Provisions    255


                                    The Administrator is granted this power to prevent potential violations before they occur. It
                                    is sometimes said that the Administrator can act when she “smells the smoke, even without
                                    seeing the fire.” Sometimes a tipster or whistleblower will divulge information to the
                                    Administrator that might be relevant to a serious infraction. To prevent any further damage to
                                    investors, a cease and desist order can be entered.

                                    Although the Administrator has the power to issue cease and desist orders, she does not have
                                    the legal power to compel compliance with the order. To compel compliance in the face of
                                    a person’s resistance, the Administrator must apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for
                                    an injunction. Only the courts can compel compliance by issuing injunctions and imposing
                                    penalties for violation of them. You will need to know that enjoined is the legal term that is
                                    used to refer to a person who is the subject of an injunction.

                                               TAKE NOTE

                                                                                                                                                Unit 12
                                               Cease and desist orders are not the same as stop orders. Cease and desist orders
                                               are directed to persons, requiring them to cease activities. Stop orders are directed to
                                               applications regarding registration of a security.


                                               EXAMPLE        Cease and Desist Orders
                                               Situation: Ms. Thomas is registered to conduct business in State C and makes plans
                                               to sell a security within the next few days. The Administrator considers this security
                                               ineligible for sale in the state. The Administrator orders Ms. Thomas to stop her sales
                                               procedures immediately.
                                               Analysis: The Administrator of State C issued a cease and desist order to Ms. Thomas
                                               because there was insufficient time to conduct a public hearing before the sale to
                                               determine whether the security was eligible for sale in the state.


                                    Summary Powers
                                    Another of the powers of the Administrator is known as acting summarily. This means
                                    that she may order, without having to go through the hearing process, a postponement or
                                    suspension of a registration pending final determination of any proceeding based upon actions
                                    described above. Once the summary order is entered, the Administrator will promptly notify
                                    the applicant or registrant, as well as the employer or prospective employer if the applicant or
                                    registrant is an agent or investment adviser representative, that it has been entered and of the
                                    reasons for it. If the applicant wishes a hearing, a written request must be made and, within
                                    15 days after the receipt of the written request, the matter will be set down for hearing. If no
                                    hearing is requested and none is ordered by the Administrator, the order will remain in effect
                                    until it is modified or vacated by the Administrator.


                                    Final Orders
                                    A final order is one that ends litigation (usually). Under the Uniform Securities Act, it is when
                                    the Administrator (or a court) renders a judgment in an action (guilty or innocent). Regardless
                                    of whether we’re referring to persons, exemptions, or registration, as stated previously (and
                                    repeated because it is likely to be on the exam), other than when the Administrator has acted
                                    summarily as described above, no final order may be issued without the Administrator:
                                     giving appropriate prior notice to the affected persons;
                                     granting an opportunity for a hearing; and
                                     providing findings of fact and conclusions of law.

                                        LO 12.c Recall the reasons for the Administrator to deny, suspend,
                                        revoke, or cancel registrations.

                                        The Administrator has the power to deny, suspend, cancel, or revoke the registration of
                                        broker-dealers, investment advisers, and their representatives as well as the registration of
                                        securities issues.


                                        Broker-Dealers, Advisers, and Their Representatives
                                        To justify a denial, revocation, or suspension of the license of a securities professional,
                                        the Administrator must find that the order is in the public interest and also find that the
                                        applicant or registrant, or in the case of a broker-dealer or investment adviser, any partner,
                                        officer, or director, or any person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions:
                                         has filed an incomplete, false, or misleading registration application;
                                         has willfully violated the USA;
                                         has been disqualified from membership in any domestic or foreign securities or
                                           commodities regulatory body due to a conviction of a securities-related misdemeanor as a
                                           result of action brought within the last 10 years;
                                         has been convicted of any felony within the last 10 years;
                                         has been enjoined by law from engaging in the securities business;
                                         is subject to another Administrator’s denial, revocation, or suspension;
                                         is engaged in dishonest or unethical securities practices;
                                         is insolvent (only true in the case of state-registered advisers);
                                         is the subject of an adjudication that the broker-dealer has willfully violated the Securities
                                           Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940,
                                           the Investment Company Act of 1940, or the Commodities Exchange Act;
                                         has, in the case of a broker-dealer or investment adviser, been found guilty on the charge
                                           of failure to supervise;
                                         has failed to pay application filing fees; or
                                         is not qualified on the basis of training, lack of experience, and knowledge of the
                                           securities business.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    Because of a lack of uniformity in state criminal laws, it can happen that a person is
                                                    convicted of a misdemeanor in one state and then moves to a state where that same
                                                    crime is a felony. If the person were to then apply for registration, the Administrator
                                                    must consider the crime under the statutes of the state where it occurred, not his own.
                                                    In other words, the Administrator may only consider what is on the person’s record.

                                                    If a person is subject to a disqualification by any SRO, even the NASD (before it
                                                    became FINRA), for something that was not a violation of the Uniform Securities Act,
                                                    that would still be a cause for denial.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              Denial is generally limited to convictions for any felony or investment-related
                                              misdemeanors within the past 10 years. However, as pointed out in a previous unit,
                                              these convictions (and even just being charged) must always be disclosed on the
                                              application for registration—there is no time limit.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              The public’s best interest is not reason enough for the denial, suspension, or
                                              revocation of a registration. There must be a further reason, as described previously.

                                    Other than when acting summarily, no order to deny, suspend, or revoke may be entered
                                    without:
                                     appropriate prior notice to the applicant or registrant (as well as the employer or
                                       prospective employer if the applicant or registrant is an agent or investment adviser
                                       representative);                                                                                       Unit 12
                                     opportunity for hearing; and
                                     written findings of fact and conclusions of law.
                                    The Administrator may not suspend or revoke a registration on the basis of facts that
                                    were known to the Administrator at the time the registration became effective (unless the
                                    proceedings are initiated within 90 days).


                                    Lack of Qualification
                                    An Administrator may not base a denial of a person’s registration solely on her lack of
                                    experience. However, the Administrator may consider that registration as a broker-dealer
                                    does not necessarily qualify one for a license as an investment adviser and may restrict
                                    that applicant’s registration as a broker-dealer conditional upon its not functioning as an
                                    investment adviser.

                                    To better understand these two points, let’s look at the wording in the act itself:
                                    1. The Administrator may not enter an order denying registration solely on the basis of
                                       lack of experience if the applicant or registrant is qualified by training or knowledge or
                                       both. Obviously, a new applicant for registration as an agent or IAR is not going to have
                                       any experience selling securities. So, the act says that this lack of experience by itself is
                                       not enough to deny the registration as long as the Administrator feels assured that the
                                       individual will receive adequate training and/or has the requisite knowledge. One could
                                       suppose that passing this exam demonstrates the necessary knowledge.
                                    2. The Administrator may consider that an investment adviser is not necessarily qualified
                                       solely on the basis of experience as a broker-dealer or agent. When she finds that
                                       an applicant for initial or renewal registration as a broker-dealer is not qualified as
                                       an investment adviser, she may, by order, condition the applicant’s registration as a
                                       broker-dealer upon the firm’s agreeing to not engage in business in this state as an
                                       investment adviser.

                                    In this case, the act is dealing with a person who has experience, albeit not necessarily
                                    in the giving of advice. Just because a person has been a broker-dealer, or an agent for a
                                    broker-dealer, does not mean that the person is qualified to be an investment adviser. So, the
                                    registration will be limited to acting only in the stated capacity as long as one does not cross
                                    over the line and give investment advice.

                                        Securities Issues
                                        As is the case with a securities professional, a securities Administrator may deny, suspend,
                                        cancel, or revoke a security’s registration if the order is in the public’s interest and the
                                        securities registrant:
                                         files a misleading or incomplete registration statement;
                                         is engaged in an offering that is fraudulent or made on unfair, unjust, or inequitable
                                           terms;
                                         charges offering fees that are excessive or unreasonable;
                                         has a control person convicted of a securities-related crime;
                                         is subject to a court injunction;
                                         is engaged in a method of business that is illegal; or
                                         is subject to an administrative stop order of any other state.
                                        In addition, the Administrator may deny a registration if the applicant fails to pay the filing
                                        fee. When the fee is paid, the denial order will be removed, provided the applicant is in
                                        compliance with all registration procedures.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    When the conditions that led to the issuance of the stop order have changed for the
                                                    better, the legal term (remember, this is a law exam) used to describe the lifting of the
                                                    stop order is vacated (e.g., “the order has been vacated”).

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTIONS
                                                         It is important that you be able to recognize the difference between a cease and
                                                         desist order and a stop order. Look at the following example questions:

                                                    1.   An agent of a broker-dealer solicits clients to purchase unregistered promissory
                                                         notes. The agent claims that promissory notes are not securities and, therefore, do
                                                         not need to be registered. The Administrator disagrees with that position and would
                                                         issue
                                                           A. a cease and desist order against the agent.
                                                           B. a cease and desist order against the issuer of the note.
                                                           C. a stop order against the agent.
                                                           D. a stop order against the issuer.
                                                         Answer: A. Unless we had reason to believe that the issuer was the one claiming
                                                         that its notes were not securities, the only person guilty here is the agent. Stopping
                                                         the agent from continuing to solicit the purchase of unregistered securities is done by
                                                         issuing a cease and desist order.

                                                         Alternatively, if the question went like this:

                                                    2.   Palterer Products, Inc. (PPI), headquartered in State J, has sent an announcement
                                                         to a number of broker-dealers in the state promoting their 8% promissory notes as
                                                         a high-interest nonsecurity alternative to a bank CD. The compliance officer of your
                                                         firm forwards this to the State J Administrator. What action would the Administrator
                                                         likely take?
                                                           A. Issue a cease and desist order against the compliance officer with or without a

                                                    C. Issue a stop order against the compliance officer after giving an opportunity for
                                                       a hearing
                                                    D. Issue a stop order against PPI after giving an opportunity for a hearing
                                                   Answer: D. Promissory notes are securities, and, therefore, PPI must stop soliciting
                                                   the sale of them as nonsecurities. The method of doing so is through the issue of
                                                   a stop order. No order would be forthcoming against the compliance officer; she
                                                   was only doing her job correctly. Remember, cease and desist orders are against
                                                   registered securities professionals and stop orders against issuers. Finally, the cease
                                                   and desist order can be issued with or without a hearing and the stop order only after
                                                   a hearing.


                                    Nonpunitive Terminations of Registration
                                    A registration can be terminated even if there has not been a violation of the USA. A request
                                    for withdrawal and lack of qualification are both reasons for cancellation.
                                                                                                                                                Unit 12
                                    Withdrawal
                                    A person may request on his own initiative a withdrawal of a registration. The withdrawal
                                    is effective 30 days after the Administrator receives it, provided no revocation or suspension
                                    proceedings are in process against the person making the request. In that event, the
                                    Administrator may institute a revocation or suspension proceeding within one year after a
                                    withdrawal becomes effective.


                                    Cancellation
                                    If an Administrator finds that an applicant or a registrant no longer exists or has ceased to
                                    transact business, the Administrator may cancel the registration.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              For any of the four securities professionals, the Administrator retains jurisdiction for
                                              a period of one year after the effective date of withdrawal of registration. That means
                                              that an action can commence for a violation discovered during that period. Note that
                                              FINRA has the same rule, but their jurisdiction lasts for two years.

                                              You may encounter this type of question regarding cancellation: “What would
                                              the Administrator do if mailings to a registrant were returned with no forwarding
                                              address?” The answer is, “Cancel the registration.” The Administrator may also cancel a
                                              registration if a person is declared mentally incompetent.

                                              Be familiar with the distinctions between cancellation and denial, suspension, and
                                              revocation. Cancellation does not result from violations or a failure to follow the
                                              provisions of the act. Cancellation occurs as the result of death, dissolution, or mental
                                              incompetency.

                                                    individual will have to find a new affiliation or the license will be canceled. Individual
                                                    agents or IARs who withdraw their registrations must reaffiliate within two years or

                                                              practices
                                                    2.   The Administrator may cancel the registration of an adviser if
                                                          A. mail is returned with notification that the forwarding notice has expired.
                                                          B. the adviser is not in the business any longer.
                                                          C. a court has declared the adviser to be mentally incompetent.
                                                          D. any of the above.


          LESSON 12.3: OTHER PENALTIES AND LIABILITIES
                                        LO 12.d Describe the civil rights of recovery for a security’s sale or
                                        investment advice purchased in violation of the Uniform Securities
                                        Act.


                                        Rights of Recovery from Improper Sale of Securities
                                        If the purchaser of securities feels that the sale has been made in violation of the USA, that
                                        purchaser may file a complaint with the Administrator. If the Administrator investigates the
                                        claim and finds it has merit, then a case will be opened against the offending broker-dealer
                                        and/or agent.

                                        If the client’s case is proven, at the direction of the Administrator, the client may recover:
                                         the original purchase price of the securities (“made whole”); plus
                                         interest at a rate determined by the Administrator (generally referred to as the state’s legal
                                           rate); plus
                                         all reasonable attorney’s fees and court costs; minus
                                         any income received while the securities were held.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    The exam may refer to the interest paid to the client as being at the state’s legal rate.

                                    Right of Rescission for Security Sales
                                    If the seller of securities discovers that a sale has been made in violation of the USA, the
                                    seller may offer to repurchase the securities from the buyer. In this case, the seller is offering
                                    the buyer the right of rescission. To satisfy the buyer’s right of rescission, the amount paid
                                    back to the buyer must include the original purchase price and interest, as determined by the
                                    Administrator.

                                    By offering to buy back the securities that were sold in violation of the act, the seller can avoid
                                    a lawsuit (and legal fees and court costs) through a letter of rescission. The buyer has 30 days
                                    after receiving the letter of rescission to respond. If the buyer does not accept or reject the
                                    rescission offer within 30 days, the buyer gives up any right to pursue a lawsuit at a later date.

                                               TAKE NOTE
                                               If the client rejects the offer within the 30-day period, he may sue. But if the offer is not
                                                                                                                                                     Unit 12
                                               accepted or rejected within that 30-day period, it becomes void.

                                               PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   How might this play out on the exam? Let’s take a look at a sample question:

                                                   Martha is an agent with Rapid Execution Services (RES), a broker-dealer registered in
                                                   all 50 states. Martha offers an IPO of a nonexempt security to a client without realizing
                                                   that the security has not been registered in the client’s state. The client purchases 500
                                                   shares of the new issue and, six months later, sells the stock at a price 70% below the
                                                   original purchase price. Because the stock was not registered in the client’s state, the
                                                   client could claim
                                                      I. payment of the difference between the proceeds and the purchase price.
                                                     II. interest at the state’s legal rate, minus any income received from the security.
                                                    III. court costs and lawyer’s fees if the client has to go to court.
                                                    IV. punitive damages equal to the amount of the loss.
                                                     A. I and II
                                                     B. I, II, and III
                                                     C. IV only
                                                     D. I, II, III, and IV
                                                   Answer: B. When a security is sold in violation of the USA (a nonexempt security
                                                   must be registered under this scenario), the client can claim to be “made whole” plus
                                                   interest, plus the expenses of going to court and paying for legal representation. In
                                                   general, to avoid the legal costs (and publicity) when a case like this is uncovered,
                                                   the broker-dealer will present an offer of rescission, which gives the client all of this
                                                   except the court and legal fees (because it is not necessary to go to court). Punitive
                                                   damages are not part of the client’s recovery rights.

                                        Rights of Recovery from Improper Investment Advice
                                        A person who buys a security as the result of investment advice received in violation of the
                                        USA also has the right to file a complaint. In the case of securities purchased as a result of
                                        improper investment advice, if the client’s case is proven, at the direction of the Administrator,
                                        the advisory client may recover:
                                         cost of the advice; plus
                                         loss as a result of the advice; plus
                                         interest at a rate determined by the Administrator; plus
                                         any reasonable attorney’s fees; minus
                                         the amount of any income received from the advice.


                                        Right of Rescission for Investment Advice
                                        Similar to the right of rescission described above for improper securities sales, an investment
                                        adviser who realizes that he has given advice that will subject him to civil action may avoid
                                        legal expenses by offering the client the same package as he would receive if he had sued—
                                        that is, refunding the cost of the advice, losses from the advice, and interest at the state’s
                                        predetermined rate, less any income received on recommended securities.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    Unlike some federal laws, there is no provision for receiving treble damages; that is, in
                                                    addition to receiving back your investment, you receive payment equal to three times
                                                    what you lost. That is primarily found in the federal laws regarding insider trading, but
                                                    that is not relevant to the Uniform Securities Act.


                                        LO 12.e Identify civil and criminal liability and penalties for
                                        violations of the Uniform Securities Act.


                                        Scope of Liability
                                        We need to define two terms:

                                        Civil liability: The accused person has not violated a state criminal code (the law). The
                                        aggrieved party has the right to sue for losses incurred. Damages are generally monetary
                                        and/or administrative (no jail sentence). These have been covered above in the discussion
                                        of the rights of recovery. The successful claim of the client must be paid by the securities
                                        professional.

                                        Criminal liability: The accused person has violated the state’s criminal code (broken the law).
                                        This could result in jail time.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    There are cases where the same action could result in both civil and criminal liability.




12_0-2532_LEM_65E_Unit12.indd 262                                                                                                               28/10/22 2:20 PM
                                                                                      Unit 12   Remedies and Administrative Provisions   263


                                    Under the USA, the actual seller of the securities or the advice is not the only person liable for
                                    the violation of the act. Every person who directly or indirectly controls the person who sold
                                    the securities or the advice, or is a material aid to the transaction, is also liable to the same
                                    extent as the person who conducted the transaction.

                                    The effect of this is that if an agent makes a sale in violation (or an IAR gives improper
                                    advice), but it can be shown that officers or partners of the broker-dealer or IA were
                                    irresponsible, action can be taken against them as well, and they can be found civilly liable.


                                    Claims Against the Surety Bond
                                    Earlier in this course, we discussed the need for securities professionals to post a surety bond
                                    under certain conditions. The USA states:

                                    “Every bond shall provide for suit thereon by any person who has a cause of action under this Act
                                                                                                                                                   Unit 12
                                    and, if the Administrator by rule or order requires, by any person who has a cause of action not
                                    arising under this act. Every bond shall provide that no suit may be maintained to enforce any
                                    liability on the bond unless brought within the time limitations of the Act.”

                                               TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                               In other words, in order for a surety bond to meet the requirements of the USA, it must
                                               provide that any customer who can prove a violation (and does so within the statute of
                                               limitations) is entitled to collect against the bond.

                                               TAKE NOTE
                                               Because this is an exam based on the law, it is sometimes necessary for us to delve
                                               into the legalities more than we would like. The USA states: “Any person who offers or
                                               sells a security in violation of the Act is liable to the person buying the security from
                                               him.” What this does is impose civil liability when the offer violates one of the specified
                                               provisions even though the sale does not. The making of a nonexempted offer before
                                               the effective date can create no civil rights on behalf of the offeree (the potential
                                               buyer) unless the offer results in a sale. When it does, however, this language means
                                               that the buyer may recover damages even though no contract was made until after the
                                               effective date.


                                    Statute of Limitations (Civil)
                                    The time limit, or statute of limitations, for violations of the civil provisions of the USA is
                                    three years from the date of sale (or rendering of the investment advice) or two years after
                                    discovering the violation, whichever comes first. It is unlikely to be tested, but just in case,
                                    under federal law, the statute of limitations for bringing action is the earlier of one year after
                                    discovery of the violation or three years after the date of the action.

                                               TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                               The USA provides that every cause of action under this statute survives the death
                                               of any person who might have been a plaintiff or defendant. Therefore, any bond
                                               required must provide that the action may be brought for the specified statute of
                                               limitations even though the person who is bonded dies before the expiration of that
                                               period.

                                        Criminal Liabilities
                                        Upon conviction for willfully violating any provision of the USA, a person may be fined,
                                        imprisoned, or both. The maximum penalty is a fine of $5,000, a jail sentence of three years,
                                        or both. It is important to note that no person may be imprisoned for the violation of any
                                        rule or order if he proves that he had no knowledge of the rule or order. In other words, you
                                        have to know that you are willingly in violation in order to get jail time. It is also important
                                        to note that while the Administrator does not have the power to arrest anyone, he may apply
                                        to the appropriate authorities in his state for the issuance of an arrest warrant. The appropriate
                                        state prosecutor, usually the State Attorney General, may decide whether to bring a criminal
                                        action under the USA, another statute, or, when applicable, common law. In certain states,
                                        the Administrator has full or limited criminal enforcement powers. To be convicted of fraud,
                                        the violation must be willful and the registrant must know that the activity is fraudulent.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    Fraud is the deliberate or willful concealment, misrepresentation, or omission of
                                                    material information or the truth to deceive or manipulate another person for unlawful
                                                    or unfair gain. Under the USA, fraud is not limited to common-law deceit.


                                        Statute of Limitations (Criminal)
                                        The statute of limitations for criminal offenses under the USA is five years from the date of
                                        the offense.


                                        Judicial Review of Orders (Appeal)
                                        Any person affected by an order of the Administrator may obtain a review of the order in an
                                        appropriate court by filing a written petition within 60 days. In general, filing an appeal does
                                        not automatically act as a stay of the penalty. The order will go into effect as issued unless the
                                        court rules otherwise.

                                        What about the SEC’s powers? As mentioned previously, the SEC has no jurisdiction over
                                        state securities laws (although federal law always supersedes state law). However, this exam
                                        deals with many areas of federal law, so we need to know about those powers.


                                        SEC Enforcement Powers
                                        Enforcement and administration of the federal securities laws, such as the Investment Advisers
                                        Act of 1940 (our focus here), is the responsibility of the SEC. As of the date of publication,
                                        there is no self-regulatory organization (SRO) for investment advisers. If that situation
                                        should change and become testable, it will be posted in the Content Updates. In other words,
                                        FINRA, the NYSE, and the like have no jurisdiction over federal covered investment advisers;
                                        only the SEC does. If the SEC suspects a violation of the law or its rules, it may take the
                                        following actions:
                                         Subpoena witnesses
                                         Acquire evidence
                                         Subpoena books and records
                                         Administer oaths




12_0-2532_LEM_65E_Unit12.indd 264                                                                                                            28/10/22 2:20 PM
                                                                                     Unit 12   Remedies and Administrative Provisions   265


                                     Go to a competent court of jurisdiction to obtain an injunction enjoining a person from
                                       continued activity until the results of a hearing
                                     Refer to the appropriate court for criminal prosecution
                                    The SEC has the power to censure; place limitations on the activities, functions, or operations
                                    of; suspend for a period not exceeding 12 months; or revoke the registration of any
                                    investment adviser if it finds, after a hearing, that the penalty is appropriate. If it is necessary
                                    to go to court, all hearings are held in the federal court system. If a defendant is found guilty,
                                    he may appeal an SEC order against him by filing that appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals
                                    with jurisdiction where the violation occurred.

                                    If the violation is one in which the SEC seeks criminal penalties, the act provides for a fine of
                                    no more than $10,000, imprisonment for no more than five years, or both.

                                    There is nothing in the USA that specifies a maximum suspension as there is in the federal

                                                                                                                                                 Unit 12
                                    law. Another difference is that, in the case of an appeal, it is made through the state court
                                    system, not the federal one. In both cases, the appeal must be filed within 60 days of the
                                    court’s decision.
                                    Another difference is in the level of penalties. Under the USA, the maximum penalties for a
                                    criminal infraction are a fine of up to $5,000 or a prison sentence not to exceed three years, or
                                    both. However, imprisonment is only an option when the violation is committed knowingly.

                                               TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                               You may be asked about either or both of these penalties on your exam and must
                                               be able to keep them straight. Federal law is $10,000 and five years. State law is $5,000
                                               and three years.

                                               TAKE NOTE
                                               Remember the sequence 5-5-3 for the application of criminal penalties: 5-year statute
                                               of limitations, $5,000 maximum fine, and/or imprisonment of no more than 3 years.

                                    Under the civil provisions, the statute of limitations runs for two years from the discovery of
                                    the offense or to three years after the act occurred, whichever occurs first.

                                               1.   Aaron is a client of XYZ Financial Services. Over the past several years, Aaron
                                                    has been suspicious of possible churning of his account but has taken no action
                                                    because account performance has been outstanding. After reviewing his most recent
                                                    statement, Aaron suspects that excessive transactions have occurred. He consults

             INTRODUCTION
                                    Before a person can become a customer, the person is first a prospect. Knowing what can and
                                    what cannot be said at all stages of the relationship is critical to not only the protection of the
                                    client but to the securities professional as well. One of the most important communication
                                    requirements is disclosure of all material information, especially potential conflicts of interest.
                                    Failure to abide by the required practices can lead to suspension or a more severe penalty such as
                                    a revocation or bar from the industry.

          LESSON 13.1: DISCLOSURES
                                       LO 13.a Identify the disclosures that must be made to clients and
                                       prospects by broker-dealers and investment advisers.

                                       When asked about the three most important factors affecting the value of real estate,
                                       invariably, the response is “Location, location, location.” In this industry, the three most
                                       important factors involved in avoiding disciplinary actions are “Disclosure, disclosure,
                                       disclosure.” There is very little that a securities professional cannot do as long as proper
                                       disclosure is made.


                                       Disclosure of Capacity by Broker-Dealers
                                       As stated in Unit 11, broker-dealers can operate either in a principal or agency capacity when
                                       executing transactions for their clients. When acting in a principal capacity, the BD is the
                                       contra party to the trade. That is, they are on the other side of the trade of the client. When
                                       the client is buying a security, the broker-dealer is selling it out of inventory. In this case,
                                       the firm’s profit comes from a markup. If the client is selling a security and the broker-dealer
                                       purchases it for its inventory, once again, the firm is acting as a principal (every trade has two
                                       principals—the buyer and the seller) and, in this case, the profit comes from a markdown.

                                       When acting in an agency capacity, the firm is acting like any other broker or agent (real
                                       estate broker, insurance agent, employment agent) in that they are simply putting the buyer
                                       and seller together. And, like all agents or brokers, they earn a commission.

                                       For the exam, it is important to know that broker-dealers must always indicate their capacity
                                       on the trade confirmation, sent no later than completion of the trade (settlement date). They
                                       will indicate if they acted as a broker (and always disclose the amount of commission) or if
                                       they acted as a principal (and depending on the circumstances—not tested—may have to
                                       indicate the markup or markdown).

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   This discussion on broker-dealer capacity will be revisited in Unit 23.


                                       Disclosure of Capacity by Investment Advisers
                                       As stated in Unit 9, the business of an investment adviser is giving advice; that is why they get
                                       compensated. They’re not in the business of executing securities transactions—that is the role
                                       of the broker-dealer.

                                       However, on rare occasions, an investment adviser might buy from or sell to an advisory client
                                       in the capacity of a principal. Or the adviser might put together a buyer and seller acting in
                                       the capacity of an agent.

                                       The Uniform Securities Act recognizes that both principal and agency transactions create
                                       the potential for advisers to engage in self-dealing. Principal transactions, in particular,
                                       may lead to abuses such as price manipulation or the placing of unwanted securities into
                                       client accounts. When an adviser engages in an agency transaction on behalf of a client, it is
                                       primarily the incentive to earn additional compensation that creates the adviser’s conflict of
                                       interest. Although recognizing the potential for these abuses, the regulators did not prohibit




13_0-2532_LEM_65E_Unit13.indd 268                                                                                                           28/10/22 2:27 PM
                                                                              Unit 13   Communications with Customers and Prospects   269


                                    advisers entirely from engaging in all principal and agency transactions with clients. Rather,
                                    they chose to address these particular conflicts of interest by imposing the following disclosure
                                    and client consent requirements:
                                     The client receives full written disclosure as to the capacity in which the adviser proposes
                                       to act.
                                     Client consent is obtained.
                                    Consent, which can be oral or written, may be obtained before or after the execution of the
                                    trade, but both of these must be done prior to completion of the transaction. This is unlike a
                                    broker-dealer, who, when acting as a principal in a trade with a customer or as the customer’s
                                    agent, need only indicate that capacity on the trade confirmation; consent is not required.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              Completion of the transaction is considered to be the day the trade settles. Under
                                              current industry practice, that is the 2nd business day after the trade is made.

                                    It is important to remember that:
                                     an adviser may obtain client consent to a principal or agency transaction after execution,
                                       but must obtain it prior to completion of the transaction (settlement date); and
                                     an adviser is not “acting as broker” within the meaning of the acts if the adviser receives
                                       no compensation (other than its advisory fee) for effecting a particular agency transaction
                                       between advisory clients. It is primarily the incentive to earn additional compensation
                                       that creates the adviser’s conflict of interest when effecting an agency transaction between

                                                                                                                                              Unit 13
                                       advisory clients.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              What happens if the investment adviser is also registered as a broker-dealer? The
                                              requirements just described do not apply to any transaction with a customer of
                                              a broker-dealer if such broker-dealer is not acting as an investment adviser in
                                              relation to such transaction. In other words, the transaction is not as a result of a
                                              recommendation from the adviser.


                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              What is really going on here? As stated previously, the function of an investment
                                              adviser is to be compensated for giving investment advice, not trading securities.
                                              Buying and selling securities is the job of a broker-dealer. This discussion deals with
                                              the odd case where an investment adviser wears “two hats” as it were and, in addition
                                              to giving advice, also trades the security.


                                    Agency Cross Transactions
                                    A similar case to the situation just described is the agency cross transaction where the
                                    investment adviser acts as an agent for both sides of the trade (hence the term agency cross
                                    transaction).

                                    In an agency cross transaction, the adviser (or IAR acting on behalf of the firm) acts as agent
                                    for both its advisory client and the party on the other side of the trade. Both state and federal




13_0-2532_LEM_65E_Unit13.indd 269                                                                                                       28/10/22 2:27 PM

                                       law will permit an adviser to engage in these transactions provided the advisory client executes
                                       a written consent prospectively (in advance) authorizing the investment adviser to effect
                                       agency cross transactions for such client, and the adviser discloses the following:
                                        The adviser will be receiving commissions from both sides of the trade.
                                        There is a potential conflict of interest because of the division of loyalties to both sides.
                                        On at least an annual basis, the adviser will furnish a statement or summary of the
                                          account identifying the total number of such transactions and the total amount of all
                                          remuneration from these transactions.
                                        In a conspicuous manner, the adviser indicates that this arrangement may be terminated
                                          at any time.
                                        No transaction is effected in which the same investment adviser or an investment adviser
                                          and any person controlling, controlled by, or under common control with that investment
                                          adviser recommended the transaction to both any seller and any purchaser.

                                       These requirements do not relieve advisers of their duties to obtain best execution and best
                                       price for any transaction.

                                       In addition to the prior written consent, at or before the completion of each agency cross
                                       transaction, the client must be sent a written trade confirmation that includes:
                                        a statement of the nature of the transaction;
                                        the date and, if requested, the time of the transaction; and
                                        the source and amount of any remuneration to be received by the IA (or IAR) in
                                          connection with the transaction.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   An adviser has a client who is conservative and another who generally looks for more
                                                   aggressive positions. The conservative client calls and expresses concerns about the
                                                   volatility of First Tech Internet Services, Inc., stating that he thinks this may be the best
                                                   time to exit his position. The adviser agrees and mentions that he has a risk-taking
                                                   client for whom First Tech is suitable and he’d like to “cross” the security between the
                                                   two clients, charging a small commission to each of them. He then contacts the other
                                                   client and recommends the purchase of First Tech. With the prior written consent of
                                                   both parties, this is not a violation because the recommendation was only made to
                                                   one side (the buyer).

                                                   In an agency cross transaction, the adviser may not recommend the transaction to
                                                   both parties of the trade.


                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   In the case of agency cross transactions, permission to engage in them must be
                                                   obtained in writing prior to the first transaction. In essence, the client is giving blanket
                                                   authority to engage in this activity. In the case of acting as a principal or agent, as
                                                   described previously, no blanket authorization is permitted, and oral or written, rather
                                                   than exclusively written, consent must be obtained prior to the completion of each
                                                   transaction.

                                    LO 13.b Recognize the general disclosure requirements.

                                    To provide some assurance that the disclosure requirements of the acts will not be violated,
                                    the regulators have recommended that each of the adviser’s advisory clients be given a written
                                    statement (the brochure described shortly) prepared by the adviser that makes all appropriate
                                    disclosures.

                                    The securities laws do not prohibit a registered investment adviser representative from being
                                    an employee of a registered broker-dealer. However, there would be a duty on the part of
                                    both the broker-dealer and the soliciting advisers to inform advisory clients of their ability to
                                    seek execution of transactions with broker-dealers other than those who have employed the
                                    advisers.

                                    Disclosure must be made to all current clients and to prospective clients regarding material
                                    disciplinary action. The broadest definition of material would include any actions taken
                                    against the firm or management persons by a court or regulatory authority within the past
                                    10 years. Required disclosure would include the following:
                                     State or regulatory proceedings in which the adviser or a management person was found
                                       to have violated rules or statutes that led to the denial, suspension, or revocation of the
                                       firm’s or the individual management person’s registration
                                     Court proceedings, such as a permanent or temporary injunction, against the firm or
                                       management person pertaining to an investment-related activity or any felony
                                     SRO proceedings in which the adviser or management person caused the business to lose
                                       its registration; or the firm or individual was barred, suspended, or expelled; or a fine
                                                                                                                                             Unit 13
                                       in excess of $2,500 or a limitation was placed on the adviser or management person’s
                                       activities

                                    Examples of failures to disclose material information to clients would include the following:
                                     An adviser fails to disclose all fees that a client would pay in connection with the advisory
                                       contract, including how fees are charged and whether fees are negotiable.
                                     An adviser fails to disclose its affiliation with a broker-dealer or other securities
                                       professionals or issuers.
                                     If a state-registered adviser has discretionary authority or custody over a client’s funds
                                       or securities or requires prepayment of advisory fees of more than $500 from a client
                                       six or more months in advance, the adviser fails to disclose a financial condition that is
                                       reasonably likely to impair the ability of the adviser to meet contractual commitments to
                                       those clients. In the case of a federal covered adviser, the dollar limit is more than $1,200.
                                     An adviser may defraud its clients when it fails to use the average price paid when
                                       allocating securities to accounts participating in bunched trades and fails to adequately
                                       disclose its allocation policy. This practice violates the act if securities that were purchased
                                       at the lowest price or sold at the highest price are allocated to favored clients without
                                       adequate disclosure.
                                     Any material legal action against the adviser must be disclosed to existing clients
                                       promptly. If the action occurred within the past 10 years, it must be disclosed by a
                                       state-registered adviser to prospective clients not less than 48 hours before entering into
                                       the contract, or no later than the time of entering into such contract, if the client has
                                       the right to terminate the contract without penalty within five business days. In the case
                                       of a federal covered adviser, the “48-hour rule” does not apply; disclosure is part of the
                                       brochure delivered no later than commencing the advisory agreement.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   BJS Advisory Service maintains no custody of customer funds or securities, requires no
                                                   substantial prepayments of fees, and does not have investment discretion over clients’
                                                   accounts. Which of the following would have to be promptly disclosed to clients?
                                                     I. The SEC has entered an order barring the executive vice president of the firm from
                                                        association with any firm in the investment business.
                                                    II. BJS has just been fined $3,500 by the NYSE.
                                                   III. A civil suit has just been filed against BJS by one of its clients alleging that BJS
                                                        made unsuitable recommendations.
                                                   A. I and II
                                                   B. I and III
                                                   C. II and III
                                                   D. I, II, and III
                                                   Answer: A. Material disciplinary violations must be reported by all investment advisers,
                                                   regardless of whether they keep custody. The first two answers fit the definition of
                                                   material actions, but not the third. If the suit goes in favor of the client and the adviser
                                                   is found guilty, disclosure would need to be made. However, there is something that
                                                   investment advisers who do not maintain custody or receive substantial prepayments
                                                   avoid having to do. What is that? They do not have to notify their clients about any
                                                   financial situation that might impair their ability to meet contractual commitments to
                                                   clients.


                                       Disclosure of Conflicts of Interest
                                       What is a conflict of interest? One legal definition goes something like this: “A term used to
                                       describe the situation in which a person in a position of trust, contrary to the obligation and
                                       absolute duty to act for the benefit of a designated individual, exploits the relationship for
                                       personal benefit, typically pecuniary.”

                                       Because of the fiduciary relationship, clients of investment advisers expect the advisers to do
                                       what is best for them, not for the person they’re trusting with their money. The best way to
                                       avoid these conflicts of interest is to disclose them so that the customer can decide what to do.
                                       Some examples of potential conflicts of interest are:
                                        offering a proprietary product, such as a house fund (a mutual fund where the
                                          underwriter or adviser is affiliated with the broker-dealer);
                                        offering a limited partnership offering (DPP) where the sponsor is an affiliate of the
                                          broker-dealer;
                                        program sponsors, such as investment companies or insurance companies, providing
                                          incentives or rewards to agents for selling the sponsors’ products;
                                        a securities professional having a financial interest in any security being recommended;
                                        a broker-dealer going public and placing shares of its own stock into discretionary
                                          accounts; and
                                        a broker-dealer publishing a favorable research report after underwriting the issuer’s stock
                                          offering.

                                       This is just a sample. The key point is that if there is any doubt about the transparency of the
                                       recommendation or transaction, be sure to make full disclosure.

                                               Suppose you were selling shares of a company where your sister was a control person.
                                               Do you think you’d have to disclose that potential conflict of interest to your clients?
                                               Yes!


                                    Disclosure of Fees
                                    Many years ago, NASAA declared that it is a prohibited business practice for a broker-dealer
                                    to charge unreasonable and inequitable fees for services performed, including miscellaneous
                                    services such as collection of monies due for principal, dividends or interest, exchange or
                                    transfer of securities, appraisals, safekeeping, or custody of securities and other services related
                                    to its securities business. However, as long as these charges are not unreasonable, they would
                                    be permitted for performing these services. But if clients were not aware of those fees, or
                                    didn’t understand them, firms could take unfair advantage.

                                    NASAA recognizes that not all broker-dealers offer the same level of services and that those
                                    who offer a large array of services to their clients may charge more without it being considered
                                    an unethical business practice. In other cases, a particular transaction may involve more
                                    expense to the broker-dealers, particularly in a thinly traded security, generally defined as one
                                    with very low trading volume, and that too would justify a charge that is higher than normal.
                                    Of course, all charges must be clearly disclosed to clients. If not, a violation has occurred.

                                    In recent years, attempts have been made to reduce the potential conflict of interest when
                                    there are different levels of compensation for different products. One method FINRA has
                                    been promoting is the use of “product agnostic” compensation grids (also referred to as

                                                                                                                                                Unit 13
                                    “neutral grids”). These can be an effective practice to reduce incentives for agents to prefer
                                    one type of product (e.g., equities, bonds, mutual funds, variable annuities) over another.
                                    These grids typically pay a flat percentage of the revenue an agent generates, regardless of the
                                    product recommended.

                                    In 2015, NASAA published an investor advisory regarding fees charged by broker-dealer firms
                                    for services and maintenance of investment accounts. The advisory followed research from
                                    NASAA showing that investors are confused about brokerage services and maintenance fees
                                    and want clear and easy access to fee information from their broker-dealer firms. A national
                                    public opinion poll commissioned by NASAA found that fees are important to investors,
                                    but a general lack of standardization and clarity in their disclosures has left investors unaware
                                    of how much their broker-dealer firms charge for the service and maintenance of their
                                    investment accounts. Here are some ways that broker-dealers can make the disclosures easier
                                    for customers to follow:
                                     Fees are typically disclosed when a customer account is opened. If the firm changes the
                                       fee schedule, be clear about it, and be sure to use appropriate methods to give advance
                                       notification of the changes to the customer.
                                     Minimize the fine print, or at least make the fees and charges clear. Whether using a table,
                                       a chart, or a list, make sure it is easy for customers to determine what the fees and charges
                                       are and how they are computed.
                                     Use standardized and uncomplicated terms to describe service and maintenance fees in
                                       order to help clients compare fees between different firms.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   A working group convened by NASAA has developed a model fee disclosure schedule
                                                   and related accessibility guidelines to help investors better understand and compare
                                                   various broker-dealer service- and maintenance-related fees. The template and
                                                   guidelines make fee disclosure easily accessible for prospective retail investors to use
                                                   to understand and compare fees. Under that guideline, broker-dealers should provide
                                                   retail customers at account opening written notification of all service charges and fees.
                                                   In addition, firms should provide retail customers with written notification at least 30
                                                   calendar days prior to the implementation or increase of any service charge or fee.
                                                   These notifications may be made by electronic means. Furthermore, the schedule
                                                   should be available on the firm’s website without needing password access.


                                       Typical Broker-Dealer Fees
                                       Examples of the more common fees that might be charged by a broker-dealer include the
                                       following:
                                        Issuance of a stock certificate. Although most securities are kept in street name, there
                                          could be instances where the customer wants delivery of the physical certificate. There is
                                          usually a charge for this service.
                                        Transferring an account. When a client decides to move the account from one
                                          broker-dealer to another, there is usually a charge to cover the administrative expenses of
                                          the transfer.
                                        Wiring funds. Although frequently waived for those with large account balances, if the
                                          client needs money wired out of the account, a charge, similar to that made by most
                                          banks, is levied against the account.
                                        Margin account interest. When purchasing on margin, money is borrowed, and the rate
                                          of interest charged on the borrowed funds must be disclosed.
                                        Account maintenance fees. Similar to the monthly charge on your bank statement, many
                                          firms charge an annual account fee, particularly for small accounts.
                                        Safekeeping of funds/securities. This is the charge made for maintaining custody of client
                                          assets, which is usually waived for larger accounts.
                                        Late settlement fee. This is similar to the late fee on a credit card. When a client’s
                                          payment arrives after the settlement date (or is returned due to insufficient funds), the
                                          broker-dealer may assess a fee.
                                        Postage and handling. Although many firms absorb the cost of normal mailings, express
                                          or overnight delivery at the request of the client is usually subject to a charge.

                                       This is not a complete list, but it includes the most common charges. What is most important
                                       for the exam is that all of the fees must be disclosed.

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   Not included in the fee disclosure documents are:
                                                    commissions;
                                                    markups and markdowns; or
                                                    advisory fees.

                                       There are other documents where those disclosures are made.

                                    Regulation Best Interest (Reg BI)
                                    On June 5, 2019, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a package of rulemakings
                                    and interpretations designed to enhance the quality and transparency of retail investors’
                                    relationships with investment advisers and broker-dealers, bringing the legal requirements and
                                    mandated disclosures in line with reasonable investor expectations while preserving access (in
                                    terms of choice and cost) to a variety of investment services and products. Specifically, these
                                    actions include new Regulation Best Interest and the new Form CRS Relationship Summary.
                                    For investment advisers, this form is also known as Form ADV Part 3.

                                    Regulation BI requires most firms to submit a Form CRS (Client Relationship Summary) to
                                    the SEC. It is a disclosure document that must be provided to retail investors at the earliest of
                                    opening an account, placing an order, or making any recommendation. Form CRS is viewed
                                    by the SEC as a document that should be reader friendly, graphical, and short and should be
                                    no longer than two 8.5 × 11-inch pages for a broker-dealer or investment adviser and four
                                    pages for dually registered firms (registered as both broker-dealers and investment advisers).
                                    The summary may be delivered electronically or on paper. When the form is updated, firms
                                    must deliver the new one to retail investors within 30 days after the update was filed with
                                    the SEC.

                                    A firm’s relationship summary tells retail investors about:
                                     the types of services a firm offers;
                                     the fees and costs investors will have to pay for those services;
                                     conflicts of interest a broker or adviser has;
                                     the required standard of conduct associated with the services a firm offers;
                                     whether a firm and its financial professionals have reportable legal or disciplinary history;        Unit 13
                                     key questions (conversation starters) to ask the financial professional; and
                                     links or other references to more detailed information.
                                    Each firm’s relationship summary will have similarly worded headings and cover generally the
                                    same topics in the same order to make it easy for investors to compare firms.

                                    As of the date of this printing, we have not heard anything about Reg BI, especially Form
                                    CRS, being on this exam. NASAA is notoriously slow about adding new, relevant information
                                    to their exams, but we wanted this material to be available to our students when it is included
                                    on the exam. Please be sure to check the Content Updates on your dashboard for further

                                                   2.   Fiduciary Investment Group (FIG), an investment adviser registered in six states, from
                                                        time to time acts as a principal in trades recommended to advisory clients. Under the
                                                        provisions of the Uniform Securities Act,
                                                          A. FIG is engaging in an unlawful practice.
                                                          B. FIG must receive consent of the clients and disclose its capacity no later than
                                                              execution of the trade.

                                                              completion of the trade.
                                                          D. FIG does not need consent because the trade was recommended to existing

          LESSON 13.2: MISREPRESENTATIONS, INCLUDING GUARANTEES

                                       LO 13.c Indicate the unlawful representations concerning
                                       registrations.


                                       Misrepresentations
                                       Misrepresentation is a prohibited practice. There are two areas covered: registration of the
                                       securities professional and registration of a security.


                                       Misrepresenting a Securities Professional’s Registration
                                       Once you are registered, what can you say about that? Can you say the Administrator has
                                       approved of you or your registration? Not at all! Representing that your registration implies
                                       any kind of approval of you or your qualifications is a prohibited practice. What you can state
                                       is that you are a registered agent of ABC Broker-Dealer, or you are a registered investment
                                       adviser representative of the XYZ Investment Adviser. This would also include misrepresenting
                                       the nature of the services to be provided.


                                       Misrepresenting a Security’s Registration
                                       Similar to the above, it is prohibited to imply that registration of a security means that the
                                       Administrator (or any regulatory body) has approved of the issue. In fact, on the front page (or
                                       inside cover) of every prospectus is a statement called the disclaimer, which states that the
                                       security has not been approved or disapproved, and any representation to the contrary is a
                                       criminal offense.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                        LMN Securities, a broker-dealer registered with the SEC in more than a dozen
                                                        states, has just become a member firm of the New York Stock Exchange. It would be

                                                          A. the membership in the NYSE is a testimony to the integrity of the firm.
                                                          B. they are now members of the NYSE.
                                                          C. they are now federal covered and will no longer have to register in those states
                                                              where they do not maintain a place of business.
                                                         D. this adds one more level of approval of the firm’s business.

                                                   Answer: B. When it comes to the registration of any securities professional, any
                                                   statement relating to approval or something similar is prohibited. There is no such
                                                   thing as a federal covered broker-dealer, and becoming a member of a national stock
                                                   exchange has no impact on the state registration of a broker-dealer.


                                    LO 13.d Recall the restrictions on performance guarantees.


                                    Guarantees
                                    There is little that can be guaranteed in this industry.


                                    Guaranteed Security
                                    As mentioned in the beginning of this course, a guaranteed security is where a party other
                                    than the issuer guarantees the payment of principal and interest (on a debt security) or
                                    dividend (on an equity security). The important thing about that guarantee is that there
                                    is no guarantee on the performance of the investment; that is, gains cannot be part of the
                                    guarantee.


                                    Guarantee Against Loss
                                    Unfortunately, it is not uncommon in the industry for a securities professional to tell a client
                                    something to the effect of, “If this stock doesn’t earn X% within the next three months, I’ll

                                                                                                                                                   Unit 13
                                    make up the difference,” or, “I am so sure you won’t lose on this investment that I’ll buy it
                                    back from you at your cost plus 10%.” Both of these are considered performance guarantees
                                    and are prohibited actions.

                                    Perhaps the simplest statement regarding guarantees is found in the NASAA Model Rule on
                                    Unethical Business Practices of Investment Advisers, Investment Adviser Representatives, and
                                    Federal Covered Advisers, where it lists “guaranteeing a client that a specific result will be
                                    achieved (gain or no loss) with advice which will be rendered” as one of the prohibitions.

                                               TAKE NOTE
                                               Although performance guarantees are prohibited, under certain circumstances,
                                               investment advisers can receive performance-based compensation. That means the
                                               advisory contract with the client can provide that an investment return that is better
                                               than that of a selected index can result in a higher fee to the adviser. Of course, it must
                                               go both ways: if the performance of the account is below that of the index, the fee is
                                               reduced.


                                               TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                               If justified, a broker-dealer, but not an associated person of the firm, may correct a
                                               bona fide error. An associated person of a broker-dealer cannot do this because of the
                                               concern that any such payment may conceal individual misconduct.

                                                   1.   Which of the following statements may be made by an issuer selling securities to the
                                                        public that are registered with the Administrator?
                                                         A. The Administrator has cleared this issue for sale to the public.
                                                         B. The Administrator has passed on the adequacy of the information provided in
                                                             the prospectus.
                                                         C. The Administrator has approved the accuracy of the information contained in
                                                             the prospectus.
                                                         D. The Administrator has affirmed the merits of the security as an investment.

                                                        date, they may sell the stock back to the firm at original cost plus interest at the
                                                        state’s legal rate. This would be

                                                         D. a prohibited guarantee against loss.


          LESSON 13.3: THE CONTRACT FOR ADVISORY SERVICES

                                       LO 13.e Identify the required elements of the investment advisory
                                       contract.

                                       The primary relationship between a client and an investment adviser is evidenced by an
                                       investment advisory contract. There are three major differences between federal and state law.
                                       The USA prohibits entering into, extending, or renewing any advisory services, unless the
                                       contract is in writing, while federal law permits the contract to be written or oral. Another
                                       difference concerns the amount of the fees. The USA requires that fees be competitive, while
                                       federal law only requires that they be reasonable in view of the services rendered. Finally, the
                                       NASAA Model Rule on performance-based compensation is a bit more stringent than that of
                                       the SEC, as we will cover in the next unit.

                                       Under both acts, the contract must disclose:
                                        the services to be provided, including custody if appropriate;
                                        the term of the contract (contracts can be of any length, not necessarily annual, but all
                                          renewals under state law, just as with initial contracts, must be in writing);
                                        the amount of the advisory fee or the formula for computing the fee;
                                        the amount or manner of calculation of the amount of any prepaid fee to be returned in
                                          the event of contract termination;
                                        whether the contract grants discretionary power to the adviser or its representatives;
                                        that no assignment of the contract may be made by the adviser without the consent of the
                                          other party to the contract (the client); and
                                        that if the adviser is organized as a partnership, any change to a minority interest in the
                                          firm will be communicated to the other party to the advisory contract (the client) within
                                          a reasonable period of time. A change to a majority of the partnership interests would be
                                          considered an assignment.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              It is necessary for you to understand the technical definition of assignment as
                                              used in the acts. When an advisory firm is sold, what do you think its major asset
                                              is? Furniture? Computers? No. It is the advisory contracts with clients and, legally,
                                              that sale means the contracts have been assigned to the new buyer. This does not
                                              mean that the clients have to approve of the sale; they only have to approve of
                                              letting the new owner(s) manage their money. They can decide to take their money
                                              elsewhere. Assignment also includes any direct or indirect transfer or pledge of an
                                              investment advisory contract by the adviser or of a controlling block of the adviser’s
                                              outstanding voting securities by a stockholder of the adviser. If the investment adviser
                                              is a partnership, no assignment of an investment advisory contract is considered
                                              to result from the death or withdrawal of a minority of the partners or from the
                                              admission to the adviser of one or more partners who, after admission, will be only a
                                              minority interest in the business, while a change to a majority would be considered
                                              an assignment. However, a reorganization or similar activity that does not result
                                              in a change of actual control or management of an investment adviser is not an
                                              assignment.


                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              If a broker-dealer forms a subsidiary that registers as an investment adviser, existing
                                              clients of the BD wishing to become clients of the IA must enter into a new contract for
                                              advisory services.


                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   ABC Investment Advisers, organized as a partnership, has seven equal partners. At               Unit 13
                                                   ABC’s annual partnership meeting, one of the partners announces their retirement,
                                                   while another is leaving to become a partner in another firm. As a result, ABC must
                                                   notify
                                                    A. the Administrator of the change in partners within a reasonable period of time.
                                                    B. the other party to the contract of the change in partners within a reasonable
                                                         period of time.
                                                    C. the SEC of the change in partners within a reasonable period of time.
                                                    D. its advisory clients of the change prior to the renewal date of the firm’s
                                                         registration.
                                                   Answer: A. When a minority interest changes in an IA structured as a partnership,
                                                   notification to the firm’s advisory clients (the other party to the advisory contract)
                                                   must be made within a reasonable period of time.

                                    The acts also prohibit waiving fees in the event of losses in the client’s account. The Model
                                    Rule states that “indicating, in an advisory contract, any condition, stipulation, or provisions
                                    binding any person to waive compliance with any provision of the Uniform Securities Act or
                                    of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940” is an unethical business practice.

                                    One final prohibition found in both state and federal law deals with performance-based
                                    compensation—that is, including in the advisory contract a provision where the adviser’s fee
                                    will be increased for good performance and decreased for poor performance. On the exam,
                                    unless the question refers to one of the exceptions we’re going to learn about in the next unit,
                                    you should always take the attitude that performance-based compensation is prohibited.

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   This point (waivers) sometimes comes up on the exam. What you have to know is
                                                   that in all cases on the test (remember, this course is about the test world and not the
                                                   real world), waivers are not permitted. For exam purposes, if you are given a question
                                                   where clients agree to waive their rights to sue, the agreement is null and void.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                       The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 would permit investment advisory contracts to
                                                       provide for
                                                          I. assignment without the client’s consent.
                                                         II. changes to be made in a partnership with notification to clients within a
                                                             reasonable period of time.
                                                        III. compensation based on average assets under management over a particular
                                                             time period.

                                                       Answer: C. A client’s contracts, whether written or oral (technically, the Investment
                                                       Advisers Act of 1940 does not require written contracts), may not be assigned without
                                                       the client’s consent under any circumstances. If the adviser is a partnership, notice
                                                       must be made to clients of any changes in the membership of the partnership within
                                                       a reasonable time period.
                                                       It is always permitted to charge a fee based on the average value of assets under
                                                       management.


                                       Summary of Notice and Consent
                                        Investment advisers organized as a partnership must notify clients when there is a change
                                          involving a minority of the partners (e.g., 5 equal partners, 1 dies, 1 retires—notification
                                          within a reasonable period of time).
                                        Investment advisers organized as corporations do not have to notify clients of changes to
                                          shareholders.
                                        Investment advisers may only assign client contracts with client permission. Assignment
                                          occurs when there is a change to a majority of the partners (in our example above, if
                                          one more of the partners left, that would be 3 out of 5—a majority). In the case of a
                                          corporation, if a majority of the stock is pledged as collateral for a loan, it is considered an
                                          assignment.

             LESSON 13.4: THE INVESTMENT ADVISER BROCHURE

                                    LO 13.f Recall the contents of the investment adviser’s brochure
                                    including wrap fee programs.                                                                                  Unit 13

                                    As mentioned earlier, Form ADV Part 2 is a disclosure document that, under state and federal
                                    securities laws, is required to be given to clients.

                                    Part 2 consists of the following three parts:
                                     Part 2A of Form ADV: Firm Brochure
                                     Part 2A Appendix 1 of Form ADV: Wrap Fee Program Brochure
                                     Part 2B of Form ADV: Brochure Supplement (describes certain supervised persons)
                                    Under SEC and similar state rules, investment advisers are required to deliver to clients
                                    and prospective clients a brochure disclosing information about the firm. They also may be
                                    required to deliver a brochure supplement disclosing information about one or more of their
                                    supervised persons. Part 2 of Form ADV sets out the minimum required disclosure that the
                                    brochure (Part 2A for a firm brochure, or Appendix 1 for a wrap fee program brochure) and
                                    brochure supplements (Part 2B) must contain. Here are some of the key points of which you
                                    should be aware:
                                     Narrative Format. Part 2 of Form ADV consists of a series of items that contain
                                       disclosure requirements for the firm’s brochure and any required supplements. The items
                                       require narrative responses. If an item does not apply to their business, they must indicate
                                       that the item is not applicable. There are 18 items on Form ADV Part 2A (with a 19th

                                            one for state-registered advisers only). Remember, this is for clients to use to understand
                                            what the IA does so that the information disclosed relates to the way the IA operates the
                                            business. Some of the items include:
                                            –– a description of the types of advisory services provided,
                                            –– fees and compensation and if they are negotiable,
                                            –– methods of analysis, investment strategies, and risk of loss,
                                            –– disciplinary information,
                                            –– how you select or recommend broker-dealers for client transactions,
                                            –– custody practices, and
                                            –– investment discretion.
                                        Plain English. The items in Part 2 of Form ADV are designed to promote effective
                                          communication between the firm and their clients. The brochure and supplements
                                          must be written in plain English, taking into consideration the clients’ level of financial
                                          sophistication. Specifically, the SEC states that the brochure should be concise and direct.
                                          The brochure should discuss any conflicts the adviser has or is reasonably likely to have
                                          and practices in which it engages or is reasonably likely to engage.
                                        Disclosure Obligations as a Fiduciary. Under federal and state law, IAs act in a fiduciary
                                          capacity and must make full disclosure to their clients of all material facts relating to the
                                          advisory relationship. As a fiduciary, they also must seek to avoid conflicts of interest with
                                          their clients and, at a minimum, make full disclosure of all material conflicts of interest
                                          between them and their clients that could affect the advisory relationship.
                                        Full and Truthful Disclosure. Obviously, all information in the brochure and brochure
                                          supplements must be true and may not omit any material facts.
                                        Filing. The investment adviser must file the brochure(s) (and amendments) through
                                          the IARD system. If the IA is federal covered or in the process of registering with the
                                          SEC, it is not required to file the brochure supplements through the IARD or otherwise.
                                          However, a copy of the supplements must be preserved and made available to SEC staff
                                          upon request. If the IA is registered with or is in the process of registering with one or
                                          more state securities authorities, a copy of the brochure supplement (Part 2B) must be
                                          filed for each supervised person doing business in that state.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   Only in the case of state-registered investment advisers is it required to file the
                                                   brochure supplements. If you think about it, it makes sense because virtually all
                                                   of the supervised persons described in the supplements are investment adviser
                                                   representatives, and they are always registered on a state level only, not with the SEC.

                                       The cover page of the brochure must state the name, business address, contact information,
                                       website address (if there is one), and the date of the brochure. Furthermore, the cover page of
                                       the brochure must state the following (or other clear and concise language conveying the same
                                       information) and identify the document as a brochure:

                                       “This brochure provides information about the qualifications and business practices of [firm name].

                                    Brochure Supplement Disclosing Individual Advisory Personnel
                                    As has been mentioned earlier, Part 2B is a brochure supplement that must contain certain
                                    information about “advisory personnel on whom clients rely for investment advice.” The
                                    brochure supplement is also a narrative format in plain English and includes six required
                                    disclosure categories:
                                     Cover page identifying the supervised person (or persons) covered by the supplement as
                                       well as the advisory firm
                                     Educational background and business experience, including disclosing if the supervised
                                       person has no high school education, no formal education after high school, or no
                                       business background
                                     Disciplinary information about material events within the past 10 years, although the
                                       SEC says that even if more than 10 years have passed since the date of the event, you
                                       must disclose the event if it is so serious that it remains currently material to a client’s or
                                       prospective client’s evaluation
                                     Other business activities, including disclosing if the supervised person receives
                                       commissions, bonuses, or other compensation based on the sale of securities or other
                                       investment products, including as a broker-dealer or registered representative (agent), and
                                       including distribution or service (trail) fees from the sale of mutual funds
                                     Additional compensation beyond that paid by the client (such as a sales award or other
                                       prizes)
                                     Supervision, including providing the name, title, and telephone number of the individual
                                       responsible for supervising the supervised person’s advisory activities on behalf of the firm

                                                                                                                                               Unit 13
                                    Who exactly must be included in the brochure supplement? The investment adviser must
                                    prepare a brochure supplement for the following supervised persons:
                                     Any supervised person who formulates investment advice for a client and has direct client
                                       contact
                                     Any supervised person who has discretionary authority over a client’s assets, even if the
                                       supervised person has no direct client contact


                                    Balance Sheet Requirement for Federal Covered Advisers
                                    Any federal covered investment adviser whose agreement requires substantial prepayment of fees
                                    (as defined above) from clients must include a balance sheet with the adviser’s ADV Part 2A
                                    (brochure) for the adviser’s most recent fiscal year. The balance sheet must be prepared and
                                    audited by an independent public accountant.


                                    Balance Sheet Requirements for State-Registered Advisers
                                    An audited balance sheet must be included with Form ADV Part 2A (brochure) for any
                                    state-registered investment adviser whose agreement requires substantial prepayment of fees (as
                                    defined above) from clients. In addition, even without the fees, those who maintain custody
                                    of client funds and/or securities (covered in Unit 14) must include an audited balance sheet
                                    with their ADV Part 2A for their most recent fiscal year with the same requirements. The
                                    audited balance sheet is also required when the custodian is a related (affiliated) broker-dealer.
                                    Furthermore, state-registered advisers who exercise discretionary authority over client accounts
                                    but do not maintain custody must file with the Administrator, within 90 days of the end of
                                    the adviser’s fiscal year, a balance sheet, but this one does not have to be audited.

                                       Wrap Fee Programs
                                       The rules on disclosure are somewhat different for wrap fee programs. A wrap fee program
                                       is a program under which a client is charged a specified fee, or fees, not based directly on
                                       transactions in a client’s account, for investment advisory services (which may include
                                       portfolio management or advice concerning the selection of other investment advisers) and for
                                       execution of client transactions.

                                       Any registered investment adviser compensated under a wrap fee program for sponsoring,
                                       organizing, or administering the program, or for selecting or providing advice to clients
                                       regarding the selection of other investment advisers in the program, does not use the normal
                                       brochure or Part 2A of the ADV. Instead, that adviser furnishes clients and prospective clients
                                       Part 2A, Appendix 1.

                                       If the investment adviser sponsors a wrap fee program, it must deliver a wrap fee program
                                       brochure to their wrap fee clients—Part 2A, Appendix 1 of Form ADV. If the entire advisory
                                       business is sponsoring wrap fee programs, the firm does not need to prepare a firm brochure
                                       separate from the wrap fee program brochure(s). In other words, if all the IA does is sponsor
                                       wrap fee programs, it must prepare and deliver a completed Part 2A, Appendix 1, but not a
                                       Part 2A.

                                       Some of the required disclosures required under Appendix 1 include:
                                        a statement on the cover page of the wrap fee program brochure stating the following (or
                                          other clear and concise language conveying the same information) and identifying the
                                          document as a wrap fee program brochure:
                                           “This wrap fee program brochure provides information about the qualifications and business
                                           practices of [firm name]. If you have any questions about the contents of this brochure, please

                                        whether the fees are negotiable;
                                        the services provided under the program, including the types of portfolio management

                                        a statement that the program may cost the client more or less than purchasing these
                                          services separately;
                                        a description of the nature of any fees that the client may pay in addition to the wrap fee;
                                        if the person recommending the wrap fee program to the client receives compensation as
                                          a result of the client’s participation in the program:
                                            –– explain, if applicable, that the amount of this compensation may be more than what
                                               the person would receive if the client participated in the firm’s other programs or paid
                                               separately for investment advice, brokerage, and other services, or
                                            –– explain that the person, therefore, may have a financial incentive to recommend the
                                               wrap fee program over other programs or services;
                                        if a wrap fee program imposes any requirements to open or maintain an account, such
                                          as a minimum account size, disclose these requirements—if there is a minimum amount
                                          for assets placed with each portfolio manager as well as a minimum account size for
                                          participation in the wrap fee program, disclose and explain these requirements;

                                     describing how portfolio managers are selected and reviewed, the basis for recommending
                                       or selecting portfolio managers for particular clients, and the criteria for replacing or
                                       recommending the replacement of portfolio managers for the program and for particular

                                     disclosing whether any of the firm’s related persons act as portfolio managers for a wrap
                                       fee program described in the wrap fee program brochure:

                                           these conflicts of interest are addressed,
                                        –– disclose whether related-person portfolio managers are subject to the same selection
                                           and review as the other portfolio managers that participate in the wrap fee program,

                                       portfolio managers; and
                                     descriptions by state-registered investment advisers of any relationship or arrangement
                                       that they or any of their management persons have with any issuer of securities that is not
                                       already listed in Part 2A.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              It is generally agreed that “buy and hold” clients are not suitable for a wrap fee account
                                              because they don’t do enough trading to benefit from the fact that commissions are
                                              included in the program fee. Because trading costs (commissions and markups) are

                                                                                                                                                Unit 13
                                              included in the wrap fee, it is unlikely to see a complaint of churning. After all, churning
                                              is done to generate excess commissions, and that could not be the case in a wrap fee
                                              program.

                                    Brochure Delivery Requirements
                                    Both federal and state-registered advisers must prepare and deliver a brochure to their clients.
                                    If the question does not specify federal or state-registered (or refer to the Investment Advisers
                                    Act of 1940 or the Uniform Securities Act), you should assume they are asking about a
                                    state-registered adviser. It is, after all, NASAA’s exam. In keeping with modern technology,
                                    these brochures may be delivered electronically.


                                    Delivery Requirements for SEC Registered Advisers
                                    A firm brochure must be delivered to each client. It must be delivered even if the advisory
                                    agreement with the client is oral (under federal law, contracts may be oral or in writing; under
                                    state law, they must be in writing).

                                    The firm brochure must be given to each client before or at the time an advisory agreement
                                    is entered into with that client. Thereafter, each year, within 120 days of the end of the fiscal
                                    year, a free, updated brochure must be delivered to each client that either includes a summary
                                    of material changes or is accompanied by a summary of material changes; or, alternatively, it

                                       would be permitted to deliver to each client a summary of material changes that includes an
                                       offer to provide a copy of the updated brochure and information on how a client may obtain
                                       the brochure.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   If there are no material changes, then nothing—not the brochure, nor the brochure
                                                   supplement, nor the summary—is required to be sent.
                                                   Although, as we will see below, the brochure must be updated promptly when
                                                   something becomes materially inaccurate, the only time that an interim amendment
                                                   must be delivered to all clients is when there is a disciplinary action. This interim
                                                   amendment can be in the form of a document describing the material facts relating to
                                                   the amended disciplinary event.


                                       Delivery Requirements for State-Registered Advisers
                                       The brochure delivery requirements for state-registered advisers are essentially the same as that
                                       for covered advisers with one very important exception: under the NASAA Model Rule on
                                       adviser brochures, advisers are required to deliver the brochure to the client at least 48 hours
                                       before entering into an advisory contract, or at the time of entering into an advisory contract
                                       if the advisory client has the right to terminate the contract without penalty within five
                                       business days after entering into the contract. Some advisers charge a startup or setup fee. Any
                                       new client who does not receive a brochure at least 48 hours before entering into an advisory
                                       agreement may terminate the agreement and be refunded the setup fee. However, it would
                                       not be considered a penalty for the adviser to make a pro rata charge for management services
                                       rendered during that five-business-day period.


                                       Delivery of the Brochure Supplements
                                       Initially and annually, the investment adviser must deliver to a client the brochure
                                       supplements for each supervised person who provides advisory services to that client.
                                       However, there are three categories of clients to whom the IA is not required to deliver
                                       supplements:
                                        Clients to whom the IA is not required to deliver a firm brochure (Part 2A) or a wrap fee
                                          program brochure (Appendix 1 to Part 2A). The logic here is that because the supplement
                                          is a supplement to the brochure, if there is no brochure, why would there be a supplement?
                                        Clients who receive only impersonal investment advice, even if they receive a firm
                                          brochure. An example of this would include those paying $500 or more per year for a
                                          subscription.
                                        Individual clients who are any executive officers, directors, trustees, or general partners,
                                          or people serving in a similar capacity, of that firm; or any employees of that firm (other
                                          than employees performing solely clerical, secretarial, or administrative functions) who, in
                                          connection with their regular functions or duties, participate in the investment activities
                                          of that firm and have been performing such functions or duties for at least 12 months.

                                    Exemptions from the Brochure Rule
                                    There are two exemptions under both state and federal law from the delivery requirements of
                                    the rule.
                                     Contracts with an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of
                                       1940 (e.g., mutual funds) are exempted because those contracts are covered by that act.
                                     Advisers entering into a contract providing solely for impersonal advisory services—that
                                       is, publishers of market letters—are exempt from the rule’s initial delivery requirements.
                                       If the annual charge for this service is $500 or greater, delivery of the brochure must be
                                       offered with the same two timing options listed above.


                                    Updating the Brochure
                                    The brochure must be updated:
                                     each year at the time of filing the annual updating amendment; and
                                     promptly, whenever any information in the brochure becomes materially inaccurate.
                                    It is not required to update the brochure between annual amendments solely because the
                                    amount of client assets under management has changed. If the fee schedule has changed, then
                                    only those clients affected by the change must receive an amended brochure. However, if the
                                    brochure is being updated for a separate reason in between annual amendments (a disciplinary
                                    action, some other material change, and so forth), the IA should update that item(s) as part of
                                    the interim amendment.


                                                                                                                                            Unit 13
                                    If, when preparing the annual updating amendment, there are no material changes to the
                                    previous brochure, and there have been no interim amendments making material changes to
                                    the brochure that was filed with the previous year’s annual updating amendment, a summary
                                    of material changes does not have to be prepared (because there is nothing to say). Read what
                                    the SEC has to say about that: “If you do not have to prepare a summary of material changes,
                                    you do not have to deliver a summary of material changes or a brochure to your existing
                                    clients that year. If you are a state-registered adviser, you should contact the appropriate state
                                    securities authorities to determine whether you must make an annual offer of the brochure.”
                                    That means that a new brochure doesn’t even have to be offered (in the case of federal covered
                                    advisers) if there has been no material change.

                                    Try to follow these next two points.
                                     Federal covered advisers are required to file amendments to their brochure electronically
                                       through IARD. They are not required to file amendments to the brochure supplements
                                       with the SEC, but they must maintain a copy of them in their files.
                                     State-registered advisers are required to file amendments to their brochure and
                                       amendments to their brochure supplements with the appropriate state securities
                                       authorities through IARD.

                                    Why the difference? I think it just makes it easier for NASAA to write a hard test question.
                                    Finally, if the IA has no clients to whom delivery of a brochure is required, they don’t have to
                                    prepare one.

                                    Form ADV facts: Part 1B is only filed by state-registered advisers; only state-registered advisers
                                    file Part 2 with their regulators, while federal covered advisers must keep theirs on hand for
                                    inspection; Part 2A is the brochure that must be delivered to clients of all IAs within 120 days
                                    of the end of the fiscal year. A brochure supplement may be delivered instead, showing the

                                       material changes. If there are no material changes, there is no need to send a brochure. The
                                       Part 1A annual amendment must be sent to the SEC or Administrator within 90 days after
                                       the end of the fiscal year.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                        Many students get confused over the 90-day and 120-day requirements. This example
                                                        should help:
                                                        Which two of the following statements accurately describe the time limits for
                                                        investment adviser documents?
                                                           I. Filing of the annual updating amendment to Form ADV with the appropriate
                                                              regulatory body is within 90 days of the end of the adviser’s fiscal year.
                                                          II. Filing of the annual updating amendment to Form ADV with the appropriate
                                                              regulatory body is within 120 days of the end of the adviser’s fiscal year.
                                                         III. Delivery of the investment adviser’s brochure to the customer is due within 90
                                                              days of the end of the adviser’s fiscal year.
                                                         IV. Delivery of the investment adviser’s brochure to the customer is due within
                                                              120 days of the end of the adviser’s fiscal year.
                                                          A. I and III
                                                          B. I and IV
                                                          C. II and III
                                                          D. II and IV
                                                        Answer: D. Some logic here might help. The investment adviser must get its
                                                        paperwork into the state (or SEC) prior to the end of the 90-day period. Then, the IA
                                                        has another 30 days to get the information into the brochure to be sent to the clients.

             LESSON 13.5: CORRESPONDENCE AND ADVERTISING
                                    LO 13.h Describe the proper use of social media for communicating
                                    with customers and prospects.

                                    It should be clear that disclosure and fairness are the primary themes underlying all
                                    communications with customers. Use of social media websites for business purposes should be
                                    treated no differently from any other business-related electronic communication. Firms must
                                    ensure they have sufficient systems, policies, and procedures to supervise, review, and retain
                                    business communications made using social media sites. In this final segment of the unit,
                                    we will address several of the specific methods used to communicate with both existing and
                                    prospective clients.

                                    Definition: social media. The SEC’s definition of social media is “an umbrella term that
                                    encompasses various activities that integrate technology, social interaction, and content
                                    creation. Social media may use many technologies, including, but not limited to, blogs,
                                    microblogs, wikis, photos and video sharing, podcasts, social networking, and virtual
                                    worlds.” The terms social media, social media sites, sites, and social networking sites are used
                                    interchangeably in the industry.


                                    Social Media, Including Email and Text Messages
                                    Communication with customers has historically been through written correspondence, while
                                    the traditional way of reaching prospects has been through print, TV, and radio advertising. In

                                                                                                                                              Unit 13
                                    the 21st century, however, snail mail has given way to email, texting, and the broker-dealer’s
                                    website. Prospects are being reached through various social networks as well as the internet.

                                    At the time of this printing, NASAA’s primary concern with social media has been alerting
                                    investors to the risks. Although some of that may be tested, it is probable that the Series
                                    65’s focus will be on usage of social media by securities professionals. As has been done with
                                    other topics not directly addressed by NASAA, we will rely on the policies adopted by other
                                    regulators. But first, let’s look at some of NASAA’s comments regarding investor awareness.


                                    Investor Concerns Regarding Social Media
                                    Social networking in the internet age allows people to connect to one another more quickly
                                    and easily than ever before. Investment promoters increasingly are logging on to find investors
                                    and their money.

                                    The role of the securities professional is to help protect clients from falling prey to the many
                                    phony schemes found on social networks.

                                    While social networking helps connect people with others who share similar interests or
                                    views, con artists infiltrate these social networks looking for victims. By joining and actively
                                    participating in a social network or community, the con artist builds credibility and gains the
                                    trust of other members of the group. In online social networks, a con artist can establish this
                                    trust and credibility more quickly. The scammer has immediate access to potential victims
                                    through their online profiles, which may contain sensitive personal information such as
                                    their dates or places of birth, phone numbers, home addresses, religious and political views,
                                    employment histories, and even personal photographs.

                                    The con artist takes advantage of how easily people share background and personal
                                    information online and uses it to make a skillful and highly targeted pitch. The scam can

                                       spread rapidly through a social network as the con artist gains access to the friends and
                                       colleagues of the initial target.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   Social media generally takes two forms: static and interactive. Static content
                                                   remains posted until changed by the person who established the account on the
                                                   site. Generally, static content is accessible to all visitors to the site. Examples of static
                                                   content typically available through social networking sites include company websites,
                                                   profiles, backgrounds, or walls.
                                                   Interactive content, as the name implies, has input from both the creator and the
                                                   viewer. Common examples include blogs, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn.


                                       Online Red Flags for Investors
                                       Online red flags for investors include:
                                        Promises of high returns with no risk. Many online scams promise unreasonably high
                                          short-term profits. Guarantees of returns around 2% a day, 14% a week, or 40% a month
                                          are too good to be true. Remember that risk and reward go hand in hand.
                                        Offshore operations. Many scams are headquartered offshore, making it more difficult for
                                          regulators to shut down the scam and recover investors’ funds.
                                        E-currency sites. If investors have to open an e-currency account to transfer money, use
                                          caution. These sites may not be regulated, and con artists use them to cover up money
                                          trails.
                                        Recruiting friends. Most cons will offer bonuses if investors recruit their friends into the
                                          scheme.
                                        Professional websites with little to no information. These days anyone can put up a
                                          website. Scam sites may look professional, but they offer little to no information about
                                          the company’s management, location, or details about the investment.
                                        No written information. Online scam promoters often fail to provide a prospectus or
                                          other form of written information detailing the risks of the investment and procedures to
                                          get the investor’s money out.
                                        Testimonials from other group members. Scam artists frequently pay out high returns to
                                          early investors using money from later arrivals. This type of scam is a Ponzi scheme. Fraud
                                          aimed at groups of people who share similar interests is called affinity fraud.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                       One of your clients approaches you to get your evaluation of an investment
                                                       opportunity that was received through a Facebook post sent by a friend. The
                                                       investment promises a monthly return in excess of 1% and claims that it is registered
                                                       with an offshore regulatory body. You should explain to your client that
                                                         A. these are reasonable expectations based on the investment and the location
                                                             of the issuer.
                                                         B. your firm does not sell that security and, as a result, you cannot make any
                                                             comments about the issue.
                                                         C. it is important to check with the friend to find out more about the deal.
                                                         D. these are red flags and are a clear warning to stay away from this investment.
                                                       Answer: D. Unreasonably high returns and not being registered in the United States
                                                       are two items on the list of red flag warnings to investors published by NASAA.

                                    Regulatory Concerns About Social Media
                                    Both the SEC and FINRA have established policies, most of which are used as the basis for
                                    disciplinary actions when the Administrator’s staff conducts an examination of broker-dealers
                                    and investment advisers located in her state.

                                    FINRA has offered guidance to broker-dealers and registered personnel in their notices
                                    to members regarding the use of different technologies and devices for the delivery of
                                    business communications. As the technology, communications platforms, and devices are
                                    ever-changing, so will be the guidance, and FINRA will continue to supply interpretive
                                    materials to assist in that respect. Currently, the use of email, instant messaging, chat rooms,
                                    blogs, bulletin boards, and websites—including social networking sites such as Facebook,
                                    LinkedIn, and Twitter—are all included within FINRA’s guidance.

                                    While the challenge is generally to determine which category of public communication
                                    any piece falls under to then determine its supervisory and filing requirements, FINRA has
                                    said that it will always be the content delivered that ultimately determines this, and not the
                                    technology, platform, or device used to deliver it. In this light, FINRA reminds broker-dealers
                                    that compliance responsibilities when communicating via the internet or other electronic
                                    media are the same as in face-to-face discussions or in written communications with the
                                    public. Therefore, all existing FINRA rules and regulations applicable to communications
                                    with the public would also be applicable to communications delivered electronically by any
                                    technology or device if the content is business related. In addition, registered representatives
                                    (agents) must be aware of internal firm policies and procedures that may restrict or prohibit
                                    the use of certain electronic communications, and in those instances, FINRA directs that
                                    employees of the firm must abide by the firm’s internal policies.

                                    Although social media has been around for some time, it has now caught the attention of the              Unit 13
                                    SEC (and every other regulator, for that matter). You might ask, “Why should I be concerned
                                    with my emails or Facebook posts?” Well, here are just a couple of examples of how and why
                                    the regulators react.

                                    The problem for regulated financial institutions is that inappropriate use of email and other
                                    social media can mean noncompliance with government and industry regulations, resulting in
                                    hefty fines, potential loss of business, and fraud. A few years ago, a major international bank
                                    lost nearly €4.9 billion in fraudulent trades by a rogue employee that used instant messaging
                                    to manage the transactions. On a smaller level, in early 2016, an agent was fined $18,000
                                    and suspended from association with any broker-dealer for a period of two years for sending
                                    an unapproved email to prospective clients. During the same time period, a broker-dealer
                                    was fined $1.3 million, and one of its agents was fined $42,000, for failure to retain emails as
                                    required. So, this is serious business to the regulators.

                                    You need to know that agents are duty bound to follow the rules and regulations surrounding
                                    electronic communications, even during their own time, if they are identifiable as a
                                    representative of the securities firm. Members of the marketing team might understand what
                                    is appropriate to post to Facebook or what process to follow to post, but without proper
                                    training, average agents may not. Their posts or photographs from weekend parties might not

                                       Review and Supervision of Electronic Communications
                                       When it comes to review and supervision, it is important to note that the terms electronic
                                       communications, email, and electronic correspondence may be used interchangeably and can
                                       include such forms of electronic communications as instant messaging and text messaging.
                                       This is particularly important for those firms that permit their agents or investment adviser
                                       representatives to maintain social media platforms.


                                       Website Storage
                                       Websites are treated as would be any other advertisement. So, the original site design is kept
                                       for three years and, whenever revised, the new copy is maintained and starts a new retention
                                       requirement for that copy. Therefore, you will likely have several different versions in your
                                       advertising file at the same time.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   Two related terms may appear on your exam. If a firm permits a third-party post on
                                                   its website or provides links to a third-party site, it will be considered that the firm
                                                   is entangled with that post or link if the firm participates in the development or
                                                   preparation of the content. A firm may be deemed to “adopt” a third-party post or
                                                   content on a third-party site if the firm or its personnel explicitly or implicitly endorses
                                                   or approves the post or the content. The key to entanglement is that your firm had a
                                                   part in its authorship, whereas adoption is the use of content or a link that is solely the
                                                   creation of someone else—your firm is just using it.

                                       If you are active on social media, you are no doubt familiar with the term influencer. In
                                       the investment business, we have seen the rise of the finfluencers. These are influencers who
                                       produce content on financial topics. In some cases, their popularity is such that a positive
                                       comment about a stock can cause its price to soar (and a negative comment the reverse). If a
                                       BD or IA adopts any of their posts, the firm is responsible for the content and must be sure it
                                       is fair and balanced. We’ll mention them again under investment adviser advertising.


                                       LO 13.i Recognize the differences between advertising by
                                       broker-dealers and advertising by investment advisers.


                                       Advertising
                                       The NASAA Statement of Policy on Dishonest or Unethical Business Practices of
                                       Broker-Dealers and Agents considers it to be an unethical business practice to use any
                                       advertising or sales presentation in such a fashion as to be deceptive or misleading. An
                                       example of such practice would be:
                                        a distribution of any nonfactual data;
                                        any material or presentation based on conjecture;
                                        exaggerated or unrealistic claims in any brochure, flyer, or display by words, pictures, or
                                          graphs; or
                                        anything otherwise designed to supplement, detract from, supersede, or defeat the
                                          purpose or effect of any prospectus or disclosure.

                                    One way in which this violation occurs is when a broker-dealer or agent prepares a sales
                                    brochure for a new issue but includes only the positive information from the prospectus.
                                    Leaving out risk factors and other potentially deal-killing information is prohibited.
                                    Somewhat related, and also prohibited, is highlighting, or making any other marks on a
                                    prospectus to draw attention to key points.


                                    Broker-Dealer Advertising
                                    At least for exam purposes, every broker-dealer is a FINRA member and must comply with
                                    FINRA’s rule on communication with the public. The specifics of that rule (2210) are beyond
                                    the scope of the exam, so we will focus on NASAA’s policies.

                                    Included in advertising is a firm’s website. Whether through the website or other social media,
                                    an important form of communications with the public is the making of recommendations.

                                    A logical question is, do recommendations made through social media come under the same
                                    suitability constraints as any other recommendation? The reply is just what you would expect:
                                    of course they do. But it is not always obvious when a particular communication constitutes
                                    a recommendation for purposes of the suitability rule. Because so much hinges on what is
                                    considered to be a recommendation, let’s look further at some examples of what is and what is
                                    not a recommendation.

                                    In addition to when a broker-dealer acts merely as an order-taker regarding a particular
                                    transaction (an unsolicited transaction, which we know is an exempt transaction—exempt
                                    from the registration and advertising filing requirements under the USA), the policy generally
                                    would view the following activities and communications as falling outside the definition of
                                    recommendation.                                                                                        Unit 13
                                     A broker-dealer creates a website that is available to customers or groups of customers.
                                       The website has research pages or electronic libraries that contain research reports (which
                                       may include buy-sell recommendations from the author of the report), news, quotes, and
                                       charts that customers can obtain or request.
                                     A broker-dealer has a search engine on its website that enables customers to sort through
                                       the data available about the performance of a broad range of stocks and mutual funds,
                                       company fundamentals, and industry sectors. The data are not limited to, and do not
                                       favor, securities in which the BD makes a market or has made a buy recommendation.
                                       Customers use and direct this tool on their own. Search results from this tool may rank
                                       securities using any criteria selected by the customer, and may display current news,
                                       quotes, and links to related sites.
                                     A broker-dealer provides research tools on its website that allow customers to screen
                                       through a wide universe of securities (e.g., all exchange-listed and Nasdaq securities) or
                                       an externally recognized group of securities (e.g., certain indexes) and to request lists
                                       of securities that meet broad, objective criteria (e.g., all companies in a certain sector
                                       with 25% annual earnings growth). The BD does not impose limits on the manner
                                       in which the research tool searches through a wide universe of securities, nor does it
                                       control the generation of the list in order to favor certain securities. For instance, the
                                       BD does not limit the universe of securities to those in which it makes a market or for
                                       which it has made a buy recommendation. Similarly, the algorithms for these tools are
                                       not programmed to produce lists of securities based on subjective factors that the BD
                                       has created or developed, nor do the algorithms, for example, produce lists that favor
                                       those securities in which the BD makes a market or for which the BD has made a buy
                                       recommendation.

          294        Unit 13    Communications with Customers and Prospects



                                        A broker-dealer allows customers to subscribe to emails or other electronic
                                          communications that alert customers to news affecting the securities in the customer’s
                                          portfolio or on the customer’s watch list. Such news might include price changes,
                                          notice of prescheduled events (such as an imminent bond maturation), or generalized
                                          information. The customer selects the scope of the information that the firm will send
                                          to him.

                                       On the other hand, the regulators generally would view the following communications as
                                       falling within the definition of recommendation:
                                        A broker-dealer sends a customer-specific electronic communication (e.g., an email or
                                          pop-up screen) to a targeted customer or targeted group of customers, encouraging the
                                          particular customer(s) to purchase a security.
                                        A broker-dealer sends its customers an email stating that customers should be invested in
                                          stocks from a particular sector (such as technology) and urges customers to purchase one
                                          or more stocks from a list with buy recommendations.
                                        A broker-dealer provides a portfolio analysis tool that allows a customer to indicate an
                                          investment goal and input personalized information such as age, financial condition, and
                                          risk tolerance. The BD, in this instance, then sends the customer a list of specific securities
                                          the customer could buy or sell to meet the investment goal the customer has indicated.
                                        A broker-dealer uses data-mining technology (the electronic collection of information
                                          on website users) to analyze a customer’s financial or online activity—whether or not it
                                          is known by the customer—and then, based on those observations, sends (or “pushes”)
                                          specific investment suggestions that the customer purchase or sell a security.

                                       It is important to keep in mind that these examples are meant only to provide guidance
                                       and are not an exhaustive list of communications that are or are not considered to be
                                       recommendations. They recognize that many other types of electronic communications are
                                       not easily characterized. In addition, changes to the factual suppositions upon which these
                                       examples are based (or the existence of additional factors) could alter the determination of
                                       whether similar communications may or may not be viewed as recommendations.

                                       In addition, the rules have always permitted the use of testimonials for broker-dealers, but
                                       until the new investment adviser marketing rule (see following) they were strictly forbidden
                                       for use by IAs.

                                       Broker-dealers, therefore, should analyze all relevant facts and circumstances to determine
                                       whether a communication is a recommendation, and they should take the necessary steps to
                                       fulfill their suitability obligations.


                                       Investment Adviser Advertising
                                       When it comes to investment advisers, the NASAA Model Rule states that publishing,
                                       circulating, or distributing any advertisement which does not comply with the Investment
                                       Advisers Act of 1940 would be prohibited. On December 20, 2020, the SEC adopted
                                       amendments under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 that finalized reforms under the
                                       act to modernize rules that govern investment adviser advertisements and payments to
                                       solicitors. The amendments create a single rule that replaced the previous advertising and cash
                                       solicitation rules.

                                       These amendments are known as the Investment Adviser Marketing Rule. NASAA began
                                       including material on those amendments on April 1, 2022. Here are some key points that are

                                    The amended definition of advertisement includes two separate parts. The first part generally
                                    includes the kinds of communications traditionally covered by the advertising rule, and the
                                    second generally includes the kinds of activities previously covered by the cash solicitation rule.
                                     The first part includes any direct or indirect communication an investment adviser
                                       makes that (1) offers the investment adviser’s investment advisory services with regard
                                       to securities to prospective clients or private fund investors, or (2) offers new investment
                                       advisory services with regard to securities to current clients or private fund investors.
                                        –– The first part does not include one-on-one communications. However, hypothetical
                                           performance information does not qualify for this one-on-one exclusion unless
                                           provided in response to an unsolicited investor request or to a private fund investor.
                                        –– The first part also does not include extemporaneous, live, oral communications and
                                           information contained in a statutory or regulatory notice, filing, or other required
                                           communication.
                                        –– On the other hand, prepared material, such as scripts or slides to be used in a
                                           presentation, are likely going to be considered advertisements.
                                     The second part generally includes any endorsement or testimonial for which an adviser
                                       provides cash or noncash compensation directly or indirectly (e.g., directed brokerage,
                                       awards or other prizes, and reduced advisory fees).

                                    Under the amendments, the definition of advertisement now includes:
                                     third-party information if the adviser has either endorsed or approved the information
                                       after publication or involved itself in the preparation of the information; e.g., it is adopted
                                                                                                                                            Unit 13
                                       or entangled. A growing concern of the regulators is the adoption (or even entanglement)
                                       with finfluencers;
                                     communications to “investors in a private fund”; and
                                     extemporaneous, live, written communications such as texts or electronic chats.


                                    General Prohibitions
                                    Under the general prohibitions, an investment adviser’s advertisement may not:
                                     include an untrue statement of a material fact, or omit to state a material fact necessary
                                       to make the statement made, in light of the circumstances under which it was made, not
                                       misleading;
                                     include a material statement of fact that the adviser does not have a reasonable basis for
                                       believing it will be able to substantiate upon demand by the SEC;
                                     include information that would reasonably be likely to cause an untrue or misleading
                                       implication or inference to be drawn concerning a material fact relating to the adviser;
                                     discuss any potential benefits without providing fair and balanced treatment of any
                                       associated material risks or limitations;
                                     reference specific investment advice provided by the adviser that is not presented in a fair
                                       and balanced manner;
                                     contain a statement that any analysis, report, or service will be furnished for free when
                                       that is not the case;
                                     represent that a chart, formula, or other device being offered can, by itself, be used to
                                       determine which securities are to be bought or sold;

                                        include or exclude performance results, or presenting performance time periods, in a
                                          manner that is not fair and balanced;
                                        otherwise be materially misleading; or
                                        represent or imply that the adviser has been sponsored, recommended, or approved, or
                                          that its abilities or qualifications have in any respect been passed upon, by the SEC or the
                                          Administrator (for example, the SEC has taken the position that the use of the initials
                                          RIA following a name on printed materials would be misleading because, among other
                                          things, it suggests that the person to whom it refers has a level of professional competence,
                                          education, or other special training, when in fact there are no specific qualifications for
                                          becoming a registered investment adviser; the term registered investment adviser may be
                                          used, but not the initials).

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   One thing to look for on the exam deals with investment advisers who advertise
                                                   a charting or similar system—they must indicate that there are limitations and
                                                   difficulties inherent in using such programs.


                                       Testimonials
                                       For the first time since the passage of the act in 1940, the marketing rule permits the use of
                                       testimonials (statements from clients about their experience with the investment adviser) and
                                       endorsements (statements by persons who are not clients) in an advertisement, if the adviser
                                       satisfies the following disclosures:
                                        Advertisements must clearly and prominently disclose whether the person giving the
                                          testimonial or endorsement (the “promoter”) is a client;
                                        That cash or noncash compensation was provided for the testimonial or endorsement, if
                                          applicable;
                                        A brief statement of any material conflicts of interest on the part of the person giving the
                                          testimonial or endorsement resulting from the adviser’s relationship with such person;
                                        Solicitors may be considered promoters for purpose of the rule; and
                                        Investment advisers also must enter into a written agreement with promoters, except
                                          where the promoter is an affiliate of the adviser or the promoter receives de minimis
                                          compensation (i.e., $1,000 or less, or the equivalent value in noncash compensation,
                                          during the preceding 12 months). If exceeding the de minimis level, a copy of this
                                          agreement shall be made available to those receiving these testimonials and endorsements.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   Although the SEC traditionally referred to those who engaged in compensated
                                                   solicitation activity under the previous rule as solicitors, it uses the term promoter
                                                   in the new rule to refer to a person providing a testimonial or endorsement, whether
                                                   compensated or uncompensated. The rule also uses the term provider at times when
                                                   discussing a person providing an uncompensated testimonial or endorsement. Unless
                                                   falling under the de minimis rule, when it comes to receiving compensation—yes
                                                   for promoters and no for providers. It turns out that there is a serious distinction.
                                                   Promoters are subject to the “bad actor” rule (LO 8.d and LO 9.c) and are disqualified
                                                   from receiving compensation while providers are not (because they never receive
                                                   compensation).

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              The “like” feature on an investment adviser’s social media site could be deemed to be
                                              a testimonial if it is an explicit or implicit statement of a client’s experience with the
                                              adviser. Not included in compensation is salary or bonuses paid to employees of the
                                              investment adviser.


                                    Past Performance
                                    The marketing rule allows the inclusion of performance information in an advertisement
                                    if certain conditions are met. Specifically, the marketing rule prohibits including in any
                                    advertisement:
                                     gross performance, unless the ad also includes net (after fees) performance;
                                     any performance results, unless they are provided for specific time periods (the most
                                       recent 1-, 5-, and 10-year periods to the extent applicable);
                                     “cherry-picking” by showing only the best performing portfolios;
                                     hypothetical performance, unless the adviser adopts and implements policies and
                                       procedures reasonably designed to ensure that the performance is relevant to the intended
                                       audience; and
                                     predecessor performance, unless there is appropriate similarity with regard to the
                                       personnel and accounts at the predecessor adviser and the personnel and accounts at the
                                       advertising adviser.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              Look for the terms fair and balanced as a description of the content of any advertising.           Unit 13


                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              Under the rule, a promotional piece is an advertisement if addressed to more than
                                              one person. As covered in Unit 9, LO 9.g, both NASAA’s rule and the SEC require
                                              maintaining a copy of all ads distributed to two or more persons.


                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              In the same manner that the use of the designation RIA is prohibited, investment
                                              adviser representatives may not use the initials IAR on business cards or any other
                                              literature. Yes, the exam might use IAR, but you can’t. What you can use on your
                                              business card are certain recognized professional or academic designations (assuming
                                              you’ve earned them). Examples would include CPA, CLU®, CFA®, CFP®, MBA, JD, or PhD.

                                    These prohibitions are fundamental and sound standards that all investment advisers should
                                    follow.

                                    Finally, Form ADV Part 1A has a new item, 5 L, that must be submitted each year as part of
                                    the annual updating amendment. It looks like this:

                                       L. Marketing Activities
                                       1. Do any of your advertisements include:
                                            a. Performance results?
                                            b. A reference to specific investment advice provided by you?
                                            c. Testimonials?
                                            d. Endorsements?
                                            e. Third-party ratings?
                                       2. If you answered “Yes” to L(1)(c), (d), or (e) above, do you pay or otherwise provide
                                          cash or noncash compensation, directly or indirectly, in connection with the use of

                                       Issues Related to Agents
                                       While much of the supervisory burden revolves around broker-dealer use of various social
                                       media tools, the nitty-gritty, day-to-day work relates to their agents. Some things to be aware
                                       of include the following:
                                        In addition to computers in the office, personal devices (Blackberry, iPhone, Android,
                                          etc.) used to communicate with clients in a social media setting are covered by the rules.
                                        Depending on the nature of the media, prior approval by a supervisory person may
                                          or may not be required. For example, an “unscripted” participation in an interactive
                                          electronic forum (such as Twitter) generally does not require prior supervisory approval.
                                          On the other hand, a LinkedIn page would probably require preapproval.
                                        Look out for the red flags. Certain activities, such as linking to third-party sites or
                                          receiving data feeds from outside sources, could contain information that NASAA
                                          considers objectionable.
                                        It is not the device or technology that determines if a piece delivered by a broker-dealer
                                          or any agent is subject to approval and recordkeeping. Rather, it should always be
                                          the content that determines if a piece delivered by an agent is subject to approval and
                                          recordkeeping.

                                       It is suggested that Twitter posts are easy to monitor, but sites such as Facebook are not, given
                                       what they’ve termed entanglement issues (i.e., the firm or its personnel is involved with the
                                       preparation of a third-party post) and the challenges they pose. Essentially, who is responsible
                                       for links to a third-party site, and who is responsible for third-party postings to an agent’s
                                       Facebook page?

                                       Specifically regarding Twitter, posts do not need supervisory preapproval except for an agent’s
                                       initial tweet.

                                    LinkedIn is considered different from Facebook, as it is more of a business networking site
                                    than a social site. With that, it is believed that information limited to your current position,
                                    past positions, and job responsibilities allow the site to be left unmonitored, as the firm would
                                    have no responsibility regarding that content for any individual. However, if testimonials
                                    are used on the site (“Joe is the best stockbroker in the world,” or “I’ve made a ton of money
                                    because of Sheila’s recommendations”), or if recommendations are posted on the site, then
                                    that would make it a business site that the firm is now responsible for.

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              The regulatory bodies are concerned about agents using social media to communicate
                                              with clients when they are using their
                                                I. office desktop computers.
                                               II. tablets supplied by the firm.
                                              III. smartphones.
                                              IV. personal laptops while on vacation.

                                               D. I, II, III, and IV
                                              Answer: D. The format is not what counts; it is the content that matters.


                                    Supervisory Actions to Be Taken by the Broker-Dealer or
                                    Investment Adviser
                                    Prior to allowing associated persons to use social media for business purposes, a firm’s policies        Unit 13
                                    and procedures must provide for personnel training and education relating to the parameters
                                    of permitted use. Both supervisory personnel and agents need to understand the difference
                                    between interactive and static content, between business and nonbusiness communications,
                                    and whether the communication is a retail communication requiring preapproval. A firm
                                    should consider requiring training in the use of social media prior to permitting use. At a
                                    minimum, a firm that permits use of social media sites must hold annual training as part of its
                                    continuing education obligations. Any such training will reinforce personnel understanding of
                                    the firm’s policies and procedures as applied to this continuously evolving technology and, in
                                    turn, limit the firm’s compliance risks.

                                    One of the unintended consequences of the growth of social media has been exposure to
                                    privacy issues. The firm’s social media policies should include relevant privacy issues. We will
                                    cover those in the next unit when we discuss cybersecurity and data protection.

                                    To summarize, because the technology behind social media continues to advance at such
                                    a rapid pace, potential damage to both the firm and employee exists. The potential for
                                    reputational and financial loss from any employee’s or firm’s mistake is difficult to quantify.
                                    To mitigate these, prior to venturing into any form of social media, it is suggested that firm
                                    policies should:
                                     be committed to writing and communicated firmwide;
                                     be written in a clear and concise manner so as to eliminate confusion;
                                     define the responsibilities of all concerned parties to minimize confusion and maximize
                                       expectations; and
                                     clearly describe the monitoring tools to be used by the firm.

                                       Until the law catches up with technology, a useful way to reduce and manage unforeseeable
                                       social media risk is to create a work environment that fosters a strong culture of compliance.

                                                   1.   One of your customers is a member of a local fraternal organization. He sends you a
                                                        flyer he received in the mail two days ago. The flyer discusses an investment offering
                                                        very attractive returns and promotes the fact that the principals of the business are
                                                        also active in the organization. The flyer closes with an appeal to join in with their
                                                        “brothers” and prosper. This is an example of

          INTRODUCTION
                                        The Uniform Securities Act was drafted for two primary reasons: (1) to eliminate conflicts in
                                        state securities legislation and make state securities laws uniform, and (2) to protect the public
                                        from unethical securities practices and fraud. Understanding ethical practices, and securities
                                        professionals’ obligations to follow them, is the subject of this unit. This unit addresses what
                                        constitutes unethical and prohibited business practices, as defined in the Statement of Policy
                                        on Dishonest or Unethical Business Practices of Broker-Dealers and Agents issued by NASAA
                                        (the North American Securities Administrators Association), the NASAA Model Rule on
                                        Unethical Business Practices of Investment Advisers, Investment Adviser Representatives, and
                                        Federal Covered Advisers, as well as what are considered unethical practices under federal
                                        securities laws. It will also explain the fiduciary responsibilities of investment advisers and
                                        their representatives.

                                        Recognizing that the industry is a dynamic rather than static one, this unit will also deal with
                                        the modern challenges of cybersecurity and data protection.

                                        Dishonest and unethical practices are heavily tested topics. You must know what these
                                        practices are and be able to apply the principles that guide ethical behavior to specific
                                        situations presented on the exam.


          LESSON 14.1: FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITIES OF INVESTMENT
          ADVISERS AND THEIR REPRESENTATIVES
                                        LO 14.a Identify the important fiduciary responsibilities when
                                        providing investment advisory services.

                                        Fiduciary Responsibility of Investment Advisers
                                        Unlike broker-dealers and their agents, investment advisers and their IARs have a fiduciary
                                        responsibility to their customers. That obligates these advisers and their representatives to
                                        put their clients’ interests ahead of their own. That is the primary reason why advisers need
                                        their clients’ consent when acting as agents or principals in trades with them (as covered in
                                        the previous unit). As fiduciaries, investment advisers must identify and address all material
                                        conflicts of interest by eliminating or disclosing such conflicts. Clients rely on the advice
                                        of their advisers and must feel confident that those advisers are working in the clients’ best
                                        interests.
                                        If the adviser also engages in nonsecurities-related activities, such as selling auto insurance or
                                        real estate, these represent potential conflicts of interest (time taken away from “watching the
                                        market”) and must be disclosed.

                                                     PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                          Investment advisers and their representatives have an obligation to place their
                                                          clients’ needs ahead of their own. This is legally known as
                                                            A. avoiding conflicts of interest.
                                                            B. making full disclosure.
                                                            C. fiduciary responsibility.
                                                            D. playing fair.
                                                          Answer: C. The obligation of investment advisers and IARs to place clients’ interests
                                                          ahead of their own is known as acting in a fiduciary capacity.

                                    Another responsibility is recognizing your capabilities. It is an unethical business practice to
                                    promise to provide services that you know can’t be provided. A tested concept is criticizing
                                    the work of other professionals. This is not to say that you can’t point out suggestions you
                                    would have made differently, such as a different clause in a will, but unless you are an attorney
                                    or an accountant, be careful of criticizing legal or accounting work performed by those
                                    professionals.


                                    Hedge Clauses
                                    A constant concern of the regulators is any attempt by an investment adviser to waive the
                                    implied fiduciary responsibilities inherent in the client/adviser relationship. One of the most
                                    common methods of doing so is through the use of the hedge clause, sometimes referred to as
                                    an exculpatory clause. This is not a new issue. In 1951, the SEC addressed it in a release stating
                                    that “the antifraud provisions of the Securities and Exchange Commission statutes are violated
                                    by the employment of any legend, hedge clause, or other provision which is likely to lead an
                                    investor to believe that he has in any way waived any right of action he may have.” This test
                                    is consistent with the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, which states that “any condition,
                                    stipulation, or provision binding any person to waive compliance with any provision of this
                                    Act or with any rule, regulation or order thereunder shall be void.”

                                    Several recent investment adviser applications filed with the states have contained advisory
                                    contracts with hedge clauses that the Administrator believed would be potentially misleading
                                    to clients.

                                    As an example, one state took issue with a contract that stated: “It is understood that we will
                                    extend our best efforts in the supervision of the portfolio, but we assume no responsibility for
                                    action taken or omitted in good faith if negligence, willful or reckless misconduct, or violation
                                    of applicable law is not involved.”

                                    So, here’s the bottom line for the exam. You will be presented with a question or two
                                    containing a statement to the effect of, “The client agrees to waive rule violations by the IA (or
                                    another securities professional).” The answer to choose is the one that states that “waivers are
                                    never permitted.”

                                    This is not to say that the acts prohibit the use of all hedge clauses. For example, the SEC
                                    has not objected to clauses that limit the investment adviser’s liability for losses caused

                                                                                                                                                 Unit 14
                                    by conditions and events beyond its control, such as war, strikes, natural disasters, new
                                    government restrictions, market fluctuations, communications disruptions, and so forth.
                                    Such provisions are acceptable because they do not attempt to limit or misstate the adviser’s
                                    fiduciary obligations to its clients; but it is highly unlikely that one of these choices will be on
                                    your test.


                                    LO 14.b Describe how the Prudent Investor Rule applies to
                                    investment advisers and their representatives when making suitable
                                    recommendations.

                                    Beginning with the dynamic growth of the stock markets in the late 1960s, the investment
                                    practices of fiduciaries experienced significant changes. As a result, the Uniform Prudent
                                    Investor Act (UPIA) was adopted in 1994 as an attempt to update trust investment laws in
                                    recognition of those many changes. One of the major influences on this legislation was the

                                        growing acceptance of modern portfolio theory. The UPIA (now used in almost every state)
                                        makes five fundamental alterations in the former criteria for prudent investing. Those changes
                                        are as follows:
                                         The standard of prudence is applied to any investment as part of the total portfolio, rather
                                           than to individual investments. In this context, the term portfolio means all of the trust’s
                                           or client’s assets.
                                         The trade-off in all investments between risk and return is identified as the fiduciary’s
                                           primary consideration.
                                         All categorical restrictions on types of investments have been removed; the fiduciary can
                                           invest in anything that plays an appropriate role in achieving the risk/return objectives of
                                           the account and meets the other requirements of prudent investing.
                                         The well-accepted requirement that fiduciaries diversify their investments has been
                                           integrated into the definition of prudent investing.
                                         The much-criticized former rule forbidding the trustee to delegate investment functions
                                           has been reversed. Delegation is now permitted, subject to safeguards and the requirement
                                           that the fiduciary act with reasonable care, skill, and caution.

                                        Because the most practical common application of the UPIA deals with retirement plans
                                        covered by Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), we’ll go into more
                                        detail when that topic is covered in Unit 18.


                                        Due Diligence
                                        SEC studies have indicated that investment advisers, including pension consultants, are
                                        increasingly recommending alternative investments, such as leveraged ETFs (covered in
                                        Unit 5), to their clients. Investment advisers are fiduciaries and thus must act in their
                                        clients’ best interests. An adviser that exercises discretion to purchase alternative investments
                                        on behalf of its clients or that relies on a manager to perform due diligence of alternative
                                        investments must determine whether such investments:
                                         meet the clients’ investment objectives; and
                                         are consistent with the investment principles and strategies that were disclosed by the
                                           manager to the adviser in the offering materials provided by the manager.

                                        The due diligence process can be more challenging for alternative investments due to the
                                        characteristics of private offerings, including the complexity of certain alternative investment
                                        strategies. Due diligence on the part of the investment adviser requires:
                                         identifying and disclosing conflicts of interest (e.g., benefits to the adviser or its employees
                                           for allocations made to private funds); and
                                         utilizing experienced investment teams when evaluating complex investment strategies
                                           and fund structures.

                                        Advisers utilizing appropriate due diligence methods do so in an attempt to identify certain
                                        risk indicators during their investment, operational, and risk management reviews. Failure to
                                        meet the adviser’s standards can lead to rejection of the manager or alternative investment.
                                        Some of these indicators are:
                                         Managers that were unwilling to provide requisite transparency regarding portfolio
                                           holdings to the adviser;
                                         Performance returns that did not correlate with known factors associated with the
                                           manager’s strategy as described by the manager;

                                     Alternative investment portfolio holdings that showed a high concentration in a single
                                       investment position, or a heavy concentration in a single sector, for a purportedly
                                       diversified investment strategy;
                                     Manager personnel that appeared to be insufficiently knowledgeable about a sophisticated
                                       strategy they were purportedly implementing;
                                     Manager investment style that appeared to have drifted over time;
                                     Use of an auditor that may not have significant experience auditing private investment
                                       funds or is an unknown auditor;
                                     Background checks that revealed unfavorable regulatory history, bankruptcy filings, or
                                       serious legal issues of the manager or key personnel; and
                                     Identification of undisclosed potential conflicts of interests, such as compensation
                                       arrangements or business activities with affiliates.

                                              KNOWLEDGE CHECK 14.1
                                              1.   An investment adviser runs an advertisement in the business section of the local
                                                   newspaper. The ad describes the nature of the firm’s model portfolio and indicates
                                                   that the firm has outperformed the overall market by 800% over the past 10 years,
                                                   and, therefore, they guarantee that their clients will more than keep pace with
                                                   inflation. At the bottom of the ad, in smaller print, is the following statement: “Results
                                                   are not guaranteed. Past performance is not indicative of future results. These results
                                                   are not normal and cannot be expected to be repeated.” This is an example of
                                                     A. a properly worded disclaimer.
                                                     B. an improper hedge clause.
                                                     C. a violation of an investment adviser’s fiduciary responsibility.
                                                     D. a wrap fee account.
                                              2.   One of the most significant features of the UPIA is the ability of a trustee to delegate
                                                   investment decisions to a qualified third party. Delegation is permitted as long as the
                                                   fiduciary to whom the powers are delegated
                                                     A. acts with skill and caution.
                                                     B. avoids high-risk investments.
                                                     C. considers the risk/reward trade-off of each individual security in the portfolio.
                                                     D. avoids diversification.

             LESSON 14.2: INVESTMENT ADVISER COMPENSATION

                                    LO 14.c Recall what constitutes compensation to an investment
                                    adviser, including the use of solicitors.


                                    Disclosure of Compensation
                                    One of the areas where the importance of the fiduciary relationship comes into play deals with
                                    compensation. As we covered when discussing advisory contracts, compensation details must
                                    always be disclosed. This would include:
                                     the method of computing compensation;
                                     refunding of prepaid fees;
                                     the type of compensation (hourly fees, fees based on AUM, commissions, etc.); and
                                     any incentives or other compensation from the issuer of securities recommended.

                                        That last bullet point is particularly important because of the fiduciary relationship. Incentives
                                        or bonuses will undoubtedly present a potential conflict of interest, and the IA must always
                                        put the interest of the client first.

                                        We learned in the previous unit that performance-based compensation is prohibited under all
                                        circumstances unless there is a qualifying exception. Now, we’ll look at those exceptions.

                                        Under state and federal law, the exceptions from the performance fee prohibition apply to
                                        contracts with a qualified client, defined as:
                                         a natural person or company that, immediately after entering into the contract, has at
                                           least $1.1 million under the management of the investment adviser;
                                         a natural person or company that the IA has reason to believe immediately prior to
                                           entering into the contract has a net worth exclusive of the primary residence (in the case
                                           of individuals, assets held jointly with a spouse, but no one else, can be used) in excess of
                                           $2.2 million; or
                                         a natural person who is an officer or director of the investment adviser, or one of their
                                           IARs who has been employed in the industry at least 12 months.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     Please notice the inconsistency in the rule. It is at least $1.1 million in AUM with the
                                                     adviser or net worth in excess of $2.2 million. Why couldn’t they both be at least, or in
                                                     excess of? Makes the test tougher, doesn’t it?

                                        The test may want you to know that a fee based on the average amount of money under
                                        management over a particular period is not considered to be a performance fee.

                                        There is one significant difference between the rules for state-registered IAs and federal
                                        covered IAs. In order for a state-registered IA to enter into, extend, or renew an investment
                                        advisory contract that provides for compensation to the investment adviser on the basis of a
                                        share of capital gains upon or capital appreciation of the funds of the client, the investment
                                        adviser must disclose in writing to the client all material information concerning the proposed
                                        advisory arrangement, including the following:
                                         That the fee arrangement may create an incentive for the investment adviser to make
                                           investments that are riskier or more speculative than would be the case in the absence of a
                                           performance fee
                                         Where relevant, that the investment adviser may receive increased compensation with
                                           regard to unrealized appreciation as well as realized gains in the client’s account
                                         The periods that will be used to measure investment performance throughout the contract
                                           and their significance in the computation of the fee

                                           performance, the significance of the index, and the reason the investment adviser believes
                                           that the index is appropriate

                                        None of these disclosures apply to federal covered advisers; however, from a practical
                                        standpoint (not on the exam), most of these are made to their clients.

                                    The most common type of performance fee is known as a fulcrum fee. In this case, the
                                    fee is averaged over a specified period (at least 12 months) with an increase or decrease in
                                    proportion to the investment performance in relation to the performance of a specified
                                    securities index (usually the S&P 500). For example, for each 5% that the client’s account
                                    outperforms the specified index, the adviser would receive an increase to the fee of 10 basis
                                    points (.10%). Of course, negative performance would have the opposite results.

                                              There are two additional points related to performance-based compensation that
                                              you must know. First, the adviser must use net performance—that is, consider both
                                              gains and losses. Second, as with so many other rules, the Administrator has the
                                              power to authorize this type of fee even when the client doesn’t meet the financial
                                              requirements.

                                    Section 28(e) Safe Harbor
                                    One specific form of compensation that is unique to investment advisers is soft dollar
                                    compensation from broker-dealers. This subject is dealt with in Section 28(e) of the Securities
                                    Exchange Act of 1934.

                                    Research is the foundation of the money management industry. Providing research is one
                                    important, long-standing service of the brokerage business. Soft dollar arrangements have
                                    developed as a link between the brokerage industry’s supply of research and the money
                                    management industry’s demand for research. What does that mean, and how does it work? To
                                    find the answers, we must review the provisions of Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange
                                    Act of 1934 and its safe harbor.

                                    Definition: safe harbor. The original use was a maritime one referring to a safe place for a
                                    ship to enter, especially during a storm or a war. In the business world, it has come to mean
                                    a method of behavior that avoids running afoul of the law. In our case, the Section 28(e)
                                    safe harbor describes compensation to an investment adviser from a broker-dealer that will
                                    generally not be considered unethical.                                                                     Unit 14
                                    Broker-dealers typically provide a bundle of services, including research and execution of
                                    transactions. The research provided can be either proprietary (created and provided by the
                                    broker-dealer, including tangible research products as well as access to analysts and traders) or
                                    third party (created by a third party but provided by the broker-dealer). Because commission
                                    dollars pay for the entire bundle of services, the practice of allocating certain of these dollars
                                    to pay for the research component has come to be called soft dollars. The SEC has defined
                                    soft dollar practices as arrangements under which products or services other than execution of
                                    securities transactions are obtained by an investment adviser from or through a broker-dealer
                                    in exchange for the direction by the investment adviser of client brokerage transactions to the
                                    broker-dealer, frequently referred to as directed transactions on the exam. Under traditional
                                    fiduciary principles, a fiduciary cannot use assets entrusted by clients to benefit itself. As
                                    the SEC has recognized, when an adviser uses client commissions to buy research from a
                                    broker-dealer, it receives a benefit because it is relieved from the need to produce or pay for
                                    the research itself.

                                        Because of the conflict of interest that exists when an investment adviser receives research,
                                        products, or other services as a result of allocating brokerage on behalf of clients, the SEC
                                        requires advisers to disclose soft dollar arrangements to their clients. Section 28(e) provides
                                        that a person who exercises investment discretion with respect to an account will not be
                                        deemed to have acted unlawfully or to have breached a fiduciary duty solely by reason of his
                                        having caused the account to pay more than the lowest available commission if such person
                                        determines in good faith that the amount of the commission is reasonable in relation to the
                                        value of the brokerage and research services provided.

                                        In adopting Section 28(e), Congress acknowledged the important service broker-dealers
                                        provide by producing and distributing investment research to money managers. Section 28(e)
                                        defines when a person is deemed to be providing brokerage and research services and states
                                        that a person provides brokerage and research services insofar as he:
                                         furnishes advice directly or through publications or writing about the value of securities;
                                           the advisability of investing in, purchasing, or selling securities; or the availability of
                                           purchasers or sellers of securities;
                                         furnishes analyses and reports concerning issuers, industries, securities, economic factors
                                           and trends, portfolio strategy, and performance of accounts; or
                                         effects securities transactions and performs functions incidental thereto (such as clearance,
                                           settlement, and custody).

                                        An adviser is obligated under both the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and state law to act
                                        in the best interests of its client. This duty generally precludes the adviser from using client
                                        assets for its own benefit or the benefit of other clients without obtaining the client’s consent
                                        based on full and fair disclosure. In such a situation, the antifraud provisions of the federal
                                        securities laws also would require full and fair disclosure to the client of all material facts
                                        concerning the arrangement. As the SEC has stated, “The adviser may not use its client’s assets
                                        for its own benefit without prior consent, even if it costs the client nothing extra.” Consent
                                        may be expressly provided by the client; consent also may be inferred from all of the facts and
                                        circumstances, including the adviser’s disclosure in its Form ADV.

                                        Section 28(e) does not relieve investment advisers of their disclosure obligations under the
                                        federal securities laws. Advisers are required to disclose, among other things, the products
                                        and services received through soft dollar arrangements, regardless of whether the safe harbor
                                        applies.

                                        Registered investment advisers must disclose certain information about their brokerage
                                        allocation policies to clients in Item 12 of Part 2A of Form ADV. Specifically, if the value
                                        of products, research, and services provided to an investment adviser is a factor in selecting
                                        brokers to execute client trades, the investment adviser must describe in its Form ADV:
                                         the products, research, and services;
                                         whether clients may pay commissions higher than those obtainable from other brokers in
                                           return for the research, products, and services;
                                         whether research is used to service all accounts or just those accounts paying for it; and
                                         any procedures that the adviser used during the last fiscal year to direct client transactions
                                           to a particular broker in return for the products, research, and services received.

                                        The purpose of this disclosure is to provide clients with material information about the
                                        adviser’s brokerage selection practices that may be important to clients in deciding to hire
                                        or continue a contract with an adviser and that will permit them to evaluate any conflicts of

                                    interest inherent in the adviser’s policies and practices. In this respect, the SEC and courts
                                    have stated that disclosure is required, even when there is only a potential conflict of interest.

                                    Here is an example of a statement found in one adviser’s brochure:

                                    “We may direct transactions for your account to registered broker-dealers in return for research
                                    products and services that assist us in making decisions about investments. The research products
                                    will be used to generally service all of our clients, so the brokerage commissions you pay may be used
                                    to pay for research that is not used in managing your account.”

                                    Finally, the SEC believes that an adviser accepting soft dollar benefits must explain that:
                                     the adviser benefits because it does not have to produce or pay for the research or other
                                       products or services acquired with soft dollars; and
                                     the adviser therefore has an incentive to select or recommend brokers based on the
                                       adviser’s interest in receiving these benefits rather than on the client’s interest in getting
                                       the most favorable execution.

                                               What this all comes down to is knowing what is and what is not included in the safe
                                               harbor. Here are some of the items that, if received as soft dollar compensation, would
                                               likely fall under the 28(e) safe harbor:
                                                research reports analyzing the performance of a particular company or stock;
                                                financial newsletters and trade journals could be eligible research if they relate
                                                  with appropriate specificity;
                                                quantitative analytical software;
                                                seminars or conferences with appropriate content; and
                                                effecting and clearing securities trades.
                                               On the other hand, likely to fall out of the safe harbor would be:

                                               PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                    The following example should help you better understand 28(e):
                                                    Which of the following would not be included in the safe harbor provisions of
                                                    Section 28(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934?
                                                     A. Proprietary research

                                                    Answer: C. Section 28(e) provides a safe harbor for those expenses paid with
                                                    soft dollars that offer a direct research benefit. Rent is not included in the list of
                                                    acceptable items coming under that safe harbor.

                                        Other Brokerage Practices
                                        In addition to disclosing how soft dollars are handled, there are several other practices
                                        involving broker-dealers and investment advisers where disclosure is required. Investment
                                        advisers must describe the factors that they consider in selecting or recommending broker-
                                        dealers for client transactions and determining the reasonableness of the broker-dealer’s
                                        compensation.


                                        Client Referrals
                                        It is not an uncommon practice for broker-dealers to recommend their clients to investment
                                        advisers. Naturally, the investment adviser is happy to receive the referral, and the
                                        broker-dealer hopes to continue to execute the client’s trades. This is considered as if the IA is
                                        compensating the broker-dealer for the referral. It is not illegal, but the IA must disclose the
                                        practice and, as a fiduciary, take steps to ensure that the charges for the services being rendered
                                        by the broker-dealer are reasonable.


                                        Directed Brokerage
                                        Directed brokerage is the practice of asking or permitting clients to send trades to a specific
                                        broker-dealer for execution. When the IA suggests the client use a specific broker-dealer(s),
                                        disclosure of any possible conflicts of interest must be made. There is nothing wrong with
                                        urging clients to use specific firms because of the quality of service received, even if the IA
                                        is doing so in response to referrals or soft dollars. As long as it is disclosed and the services
                                        rendered bear a reasonable relationship to their cost, directed brokerage should be a good deal
                                        for both the client and the IA. On the other hand, if the adviser permits the client to direct
                                        the brokerage firm to use, certain other disclosures are required. For example, the IA must
                                        explain that it may be unable to achieve most favorable execution of client transactions or that
                                        directing brokerage may cost clients more money. For example, in a client-directed brokerage
                                        account, the client may pay higher brokerage commissions because the IA may not be able
                                        to aggregate orders to reduce transaction costs, or the client may receive less favorable prices
                                        because the IA has arranged a preferred commission rate with a preferred broker-dealer. Here
                                        is an example of how that might appear in the brochure:

                                        “It is important to note that if you do not give KAPCO Advisers discretion to direct trades, you
                                        may limit our ability to negotiate favorable commissions and seek best execution for trades in your
                                        account. You may also be excluded from block trades and average price transactions.”


                                        Trade Aggregation and Allocation
                                        This is the practice of bundling (sometimes called bunching) trades to obtain volume discounts
                                        on execution costs. It occurs most often when an IA with discretion over accounts has several
                                        of them for whom the same security is appropriate and, instead of entering separate orders,
                                        enters them as one larger order. This invariably saves on execution costs. Sometimes, the order
                                        cannot be filled in one transaction or at a single price. In that case, it is generally considered
                                        that the fairest method of allocating the security’s cost is on an average basis.

                                    Rules on Custody of Funds and Securities
                                    For the most part, the federal and state rules are identical. Our text will focus on the rule
                                    stated in the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and, where the NASAA Model Rule differs, a
                                    notation will be made.

                                    If you are an investment adviser registered or required to be registered under either federal
                                    or state law, it is a fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative act, practice, or course of business
                                    within the meaning of the act for you to have custody of client funds or securities unless the
                                    following conditions are met:
                                     You have a qualified custodian. A qualified custodian maintains those funds and securities
                                       in a separate account for each client under that client’s name, or in accounts that contain

                                       your client’s behalf, either under the client’s name or under your name as agent, you must
                                       notify the client in writing of the qualified custodian’s name and address and the manner
                                       in which the funds or securities are maintained, promptly when the account is opened
                                       and following any changes to this information, such as a change in the location of the

                                                you have custody of funds or securities, identifying the amount of funds and of
                                                each security of which you have custody at the end of the period and setting forth
                                                all transactions during that period. An independent public accountant must verify
                                                all of those funds and securities by actual examination at least once during each
                                                calendar year, at a time that is chosen by the accountant without prior notice or
                                                announcement to you and that is irregular from year to year, and file a copy of the
                                                auditor’s report and financial statements with the SEC/Administrator stating that it
                                                has examined the funds and securities and describing the nature and extent of the
                                                examination. If the independent public accountant finds any material discrepancies
                                                during the course of the examination, the accountant must promptly notify the SEC/
                                                Administrator.
                                         Under the NASAA Model Rule, in the absence of a rule prohibiting custody, the
                                           investment adviser notifies the Administrator promptly in writing on Form ADV that the
                                           investment adviser has or may have custody.

                                        Definition: custody. For the purposes of this rule, custody means holding, directly or
                                        indirectly, client funds or securities, or having any authority to obtain possession of them.

                                        Custody also includes:
                                         possession of client funds or securities (but not of checks drawn by clients and made
                                           payable to third parties) unless you receive them inadvertently and you return them to
                                           the sender promptly, in any case within three business days of receiving them; therefore,
                                           you should remember that the SEC never considers the receipt of a third-party check to
                                           constitute custody, while the Administrator will if the check is not sent on within three
                                           business days (NASAA—under state law, the receipt of checks drawn by clients and made
                                           payable to unrelated third parties is considered custody unless forwarded to the third
                                           party within three business days of receipt, with the adviser maintaining a record of the
                                           event);
                                             –– On the other hand, when an advisory customer sends a check to the adviser as
                                                payment for the advisory fee, that is not considered custody because it is no longer
                                                the customer’s money; it belongs to the adviser.

                                                would not be considered custody if the certificate were returned to the client within

                                           or permitted to withdraw client funds or securities maintained with a custodian upon
                                           your instruction to the custodian;
                                         any capacity (such as general partner of a limited partnership, managing member of a
                                           limited liability company, or a comparable position for another type of pooled investment
                                           vehicle or trustee of a trust) that gives you or your supervised person legal ownership of or
                                           access to client funds or securities.

                                        A qualified custodian is a bank or savings association that has deposits insured by the Federal
                                        Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act; a broker-dealer
                                        holding the client assets in customer accounts who is registered in the appropriate state and
                                        with the SEC; and a foreign financial institution that customarily holds financial assets for its
                                        customers, provided that the foreign financial institution keeps the advisory clients’ assets in
                                        customer accounts segregated from its proprietary assets.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              Most investment advisers do not take custody and, therefore, are unable to accept
                                              direct delivery of customer securities or funds except under the limited conditions
                                              described in this section. However, broker-dealers are not constrained by this rule;
                                              they are only required to provide receipts anytime they accept customer assets.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              There are two major benefits to an investment adviser using a qualified custodian.
                                               Because the custodian is sending the quarterly reports to the client, that
                                                 administrative burden is lifted from the investment adviser.
                                               There is no requirement for a surprise annual audit by an independent
                                                 accountant.

                                    The NASAA Model Rule also adds language dealing with direct fee deduction. An adviser
                                    who has custody because the adviser’s fees are directly deducted from client’s accounts must
                                    also provide the following safeguards:
                                     Written authorization—the adviser must have written authorization from each client to
                                       deduct advisory fees from the accounts held with the qualified custodian.
                                     Notice of fee deduction—each time a fee is directly deducted from a client account, the
                                       adviser must concurrently
                                        –– send the qualified custodian notice of the amount of the fee to be deducted from the
                                           client’s account, and
                                        –– send the client an invoice itemizing the fee. Itemization includes the formula used to
                                           calculate the fee, the amount of assets under management the fee is based on, and the
                                           time period covered by the fee.
                                     Notice of safeguards—the investment adviser notifies the Administrator in writing on
                                       Form ADV that the adviser intends to use the safeguards provided above.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              If the above three requirements are satisfied, then the IA who is only considered
                                              to have custody because of direct deduction of fees will receive a waiver from the
                                              financial requirements for the net worth and bonding requirements described earlier

                                                                                                                                                Unit 14
                                              in this unit (usually $35,000). In addition, just as with the IA who uses a qualified
                                              custodian, they will be relieved of the obligation to file an audited balance sheet.

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              Let’s look at three examples of custody given by the SEC.
                                               An adviser that holds clients’ stock certificates or cash, even temporarily, puts
                                                 those assets at risk of misuse or loss. The rule, however, expressly excludes
                                                 inadvertent receipt by the adviser of client funds or securities, so long as the
                                                 adviser returns them to the sender within three business days of receiving them.
                                                 The rule does not permit advisers to forward clients’ funds and securities without
                                                 having custody, although advisers may certainly assist clients in such matters. In
                                                 addition, the rule makes clear that an adviser’s possession of a check drawn by
                                                 the client and made payable to a third party is not possession of client funds for
                                                 purposes of the custody definition. (Note that this is only true under NASAA rules
                                                 if forwarded within three business days.)

                                                      An adviser has custody if it has the authority to withdraw funds or securities from
                                                        a client’s account. An adviser with power of attorney to sign checks on a client’s
                                                        behalf, to withdraw funds or securities from a client’s account, or to dispose of
                                                        client funds or securities for any purpose other than authorized trading has access
                                                        to the client’s assets. An adviser authorized to deduct advisory fees or other
                                                        expenses directly from a client’s account has access to, and therefore has custody
                                                        of, the client funds and securities in that account. These advisers might not have
                                                        possession of client assets, but they have the authority to obtain possession.
                                                      An adviser has custody if it acts in any capacity that gives the adviser legal
                                                        ownership of, or access to, the client funds or securities. One common instance
                                                        is a firm that acts as both general partner and investment adviser to a limited
                                                        partnership. By virtue of its position as general partner, the adviser generally has
                                                        authority to dispose of funds and securities in the limited partnership’s account
                                                        and thus has custody of client assets.

                                                     Under the NASAA Model Rule on Recordkeeping of Investment Advisers, if a
                                                     state-registered investment adviser has custody because it advises a pooled
                                                     investment vehicle (see Unit 3), the adviser must also keep true, accurate, and current
                                                     audited account statements. The records required to be made and kept include:
                                                      the date(s) of the audit;

                                        The adviser is not required to keep a copy of the minutes of the board of directors, bank
                                        statements, or the trust agreement.

                                                     PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                          Which of the following advisers would be deemed to have custody of customer funds
                                                          or securities as defined in the Investment Advisers Act of 1940?
                                                           A. The adviser receives the proceeds of sales in the customer’s account.
                                                           B. The adviser receives a fee of $1,500 as a prepayment for the next contract year.
                                                           C. The adviser has investment discretion over the account.
                                                           D. All of the above.
                                                          Answer: A. Under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, discretion and substantial
                                                          prepayments are not considered custody. Access to funds in the client’s account is
                                                          one of the standard tenets of custody.

                                                     Although the general rule is that state-registered investment advisers having custody
                                                     must maintain a minimum net worth of $35,000 (or an equivalent surety bond), the net

                                    Form ADV-E
                                    Investment advisers that have custody of client funds or securities are required to undergo an
                                    annual surprise examination by an independent public accountant to verify client funds and
                                    securities. Form ADV-E is used as a cover page for a certificate of accounting of securities
                                    and funds of which the investment adviser has custody (surprise exam report). Form ADV-E
                                    contains both information about the adviser and the surprise exam conducted.

                                    The Form ADV-E is filled out by the investment adviser and then submitted along with
                                    the surprise examination report or statement by the independent public accountant after a
                                    surprise inspection of the adviser.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              Filing of Form ADV-E is required only when the investment adviser, rather than a
                                              qualified custodian, maintains custody of customer funds/securities.



                                    LO 14.f Recall the rules on maintaining discretion over customer
                                    accounts and complying with the Bank Secrecy Act.


                                    Investment Discretion
                                    Investment discretion is frequently lumped together with custody. They are not the same thing,
                                    and the exam will want you to know the differences.

                                    A discretionary account is an account set up with preapproved authority for a securities
                                    professional to make transactions without having to ask for specific approval.

                                    Discretion is defined as the authority to decide:
                                     which security;
                                     the number of shares or units; or
                                     whether to buy or sell.
                                    Normally, an order to buy or sell a security is at the direction of the client, generally via

                                                                                                                                                   Unit 14
                                    a telephone call (firms will not accept emailed orders without oral verification from the
                                    client). Many clients prefer the convenience of letting their securities professional “call the
                                    shots.” Obviously, the ability to determine the trading activity in a client’s account presents
                                    a potential conflict of interest. In the case of broker-dealers and agents, their compensation
                                    is transaction based—the more trading, the more income. In the case of investment advisers
                                    and their IARs, the conflict is less prominent (they are rarely compensated for trading), but,
                                    especially with the fiduciary responsibility they carry, there is a burden on them not to incur
                                    unnecessary trading costs in their clients’ accounts.

                                              To identify a discretionary order, try this method: an order is discretionary if any one of
                                              the three A’s is missing from the customer order. The three A’s are:
                                               Activity;
                                               Amount; and
                                               Asset.

                                        Discretion: Time or Price
                                        Both state and federal law prohibit the exercise of any discretionary power by a broker-dealer
                                        or agent in a customer’s account unless the customer has given prior written authorization (a
                                        power of attorney/trading authorization) to a stated individual or individuals and the account
                                        has been accepted by the brokerage firm, as evidenced in writing by the firm. No discretionary
                                        transactions can take place without this document on file. Once authorization is given, the
                                        firm is legally empowered to make trading decisions for the account, although the customer
                                        may also continue to enter orders on her own if she wishes.

                                        There is an exception to this requirement that applies to the exercise of time or price
                                        discretion—it is discretion orally granted by the customer to purchase or sell a specific
                                        amount of a particular security (e.g., “Buy 100 shares of ABCD and get the best price you
                                        can”).

                                        An oral grant of time or price discretion is limited to the end of the business day on which the
                                        customer grants it. An extension of such time or price discretion requires explicit signed and
                                        dated customer instructions. Any exercise of time or price discretion must be reflected on the
                                        order ticket (as is the case with regular discretion).

                                        Why is it necessary to have written instructions if the discretion is to carry beyond the
                                        date of the order? The concept of time or price discretion has been subject to abuse and/or
                                        misunderstanding. At one time, there was no time limit placed on a grant of oral time or
                                        price discretion by a customer. This became problematic in instances where an agent was
                                        granted such discretion but did not exercise it for an extended period of time, sometimes
                                        several weeks. This led to claims of unauthorized trading by customers who may have
                                        forgotten that they granted the discretion or assumed it was not valid for such an extended
                                        period of time. The written extension requirement under the rules is intended to prevent such
                                        misunderstandings.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     Discretion does not apply to decisions regarding the timing of an investment or the
                                                     price at which it is acquired.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     An order from a customer worded “Buy 100 shares of ABC for my account whenever
                                                     you think the price is right” is not a discretionary order because the client has
                                                     specified the action (buy), the amount (100 shares), and the asset (ABC). Time or price
                                                     are not considered discretion.


                                        Discretion for Investment Advisers
                                        Like anyone else, an investment adviser must have written authorization to exercise discretion
                                        in a client’s advisory account. However, there is a unique provision found in the NASAA
                                        Model Rules that permits oral discretionary authority to be used for the initial transactions
                                        in a customer’s account during the first 10 business days after the date of the first transaction.
                                        After that time, if the written authorization has not been received, no further discretionary
                                        activity can take place.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              Be aware of the calendar. The 10-business-day period is equal to two normal work
                                              weeks. If a client opens a discretionary account with an investment adviser and gives
                                              the OK orally, but three weeks have passed by since the initial trade and the written
                                              authorization has not been received, the IA can’t exercise discretion in the account,
                                              even if not taking action would cause disastrous results to the client’s portfolio.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              Probably the greatest concern of the regulators when it comes to discretionary
                                              accounts is the possibility of the account being churned. Churning can be described
                                              as a securities professional effecting transactions in a discretionary account that
                                              are excessive in size or frequency, in view of the financial resources, objectives,
                                              and character of the account. To safeguard against the possibility of churning, a
                                              designated supervisor or manager must review all trading activity in discretionary
                                              accounts frequently and systematically. We will discuss churning again later in this
                                              unit.


                                    Third-Party Trading Authorization
                                    In addition to granting a securities professional discretionary trading authorization, there
                                    is another common case where clients allow others to exercise control over their accounts.
                                    In Unit 16, we will discuss these in greater detail, but at this point, what you need to know
                                    is that executing a transaction on behalf of a customer without authorization to do so is a
                                    prohibited practice.

                                    Securities professionals may never enter an order for a client without proper written
                                    authorization, even when it is in the best interest of the client. You may be asked a question
                                    where a spouse of a client or another person with a strong personal relationship contacts an
                                    agent with transaction instructions, allegedly on behalf of the client. Unless there is a written
                                    third-party trading authorization on file, no activity can take place.

                                    Somewhat related to this activity is deliberately failing to follow a customer’s instructions.
                                    In this case, the client has given the specific terms of the order, and if the agent decides to
                                    purchase more or less than ordered or in any other way changes the nature of the order, it is a
                                    prohibited practice.

                                                                                                                                               Unit 14
                                    Commingling of Customer and Firm Assets
                                    Broker-dealers and investment advisers must segregate customers’ free securities or securities
                                    held in safekeeping. Customer “free” securities are those that have no lien against them
                                    (just like one might have a lien against your car). Securities pledged as collateral in a margin
                                    account have a lien against them.

                                    Securities that are held in a customer’s name must not be commingled (mixed) with securities
                                    of the firm.

                                    If a firm has 100,000 shares of ABCD common stock in its own proprietary account and its
                                    clients separately own an additional 100,000 shares, the firm may not place customer shares in
                                    the firm’s proprietary account.

                                    To mix shares together would give undue leverage or borrowing power to a firm and could
                                    jeopardize the security of client securities in the event of default.

                                        Improper Hypothecation
                                        It is unethical to hypothecate (pledge as collateral) a customer’s securities unless the
                                        broker-dealer secures from the customer a properly executed written consent promptly after
                                        the initial transaction in the client’s margin account. This will be explained fully in Unit 23.


                                        Money Laundering
                                        Money laundering involves disguising financial assets so they can be utilized without detecting
                                        the illegal activity that produced them. Through money laundering, a criminal transforms
                                        the proceeds of illicit activities into funds that appear to have been generated by legal means.
                                        Money laundering enables criminals to hide and legitimize the proceeds derived from illegal
                                        ventures.


                                        Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs)
                                        The Bank Secrecy Act requires every financial institution to electronically file through the
                                        Department of the U.S. Treasury a currency transaction report (CTR) on FinCEN Form 112
                                        for each cash transaction that exceeds $10,000 within 15 days of receipt of the currency. This
                                        requirement applies to cash transactions used to pay off loans; the electronic transfer of funds;
                                        or the purchase of certificates of deposit, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or other investments.
                                        The act also requires the reporting of wire transfers of $3,000 or more.

                                        If anyone designs deposits to fall under the $10,000 radar, this is a prohibited activity
                                        known as structuring. Financial institutions should have systems in place to monitor for and
                                        recognize such attempts.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     A customer makes 25 $500 cash deposits to pay for a $12,500 transaction. This should
                                                     be recognized at an attempt to structure payments to fall under the $10,000 radar to
                                                     avoid the filing of a CTR.

                                                          account statements must be sent no less frequently than

                                                          discretionary authority?

             LESSON 14.4: ETHICAL BEHAVIOR OF INVESTMENT ADVISERS AND
             THEIR REPRESENTATIVES

                                    LO 14.g Identify the implication of the NASAA Model Rule on
                                    Unethical Business Practices of Investment Advisers, Investment
                                    Adviser Representatives, and Federal Covered Advisers.

                                    NASAA’s Model Rule for investment advisers contains most of the prohibitions on unethical
                                    business practices of these securities professionals. Many of these practices have already been
                                    discussed previously in the text or will be covered in the following lessons, so we’ll limit this
                                    coverage largely to new items. Please read Appendix B for the complete listing, because there
                                    are several exam questions drawn from that information.


                                    Unethical Practices Relating Solely to Investment Advisers and
                                    Their Representatives
                                    Suitability of Recommendations
                                    Because the primary role of an investment adviser and its IARs is the furnishing of advice,
                                    it is clearly unethical to make any recommendation that is not suitable for the customer.
                                    Suitability depends on a number of factors, and all of them must be considered when making
                                    a recommendation.

                                               TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                               An unethical business practice is making blanket recommendations. That is when
                                               the investment adviser recommends the same security to most or all clients without
                                               regard to individual suitability.


                                    Use of Third-Party Reports
                                    It is considered unethical to provide a report or recommendation to any advisory client
                                    prepared by someone other than the adviser without disclosing that fact. (This prohibition
                                    does not apply to a situation where the adviser uses published research reports or statistical

                                                                                                                                                  Unit 14
                                    analyses to render advice or where an adviser orders such a report in the normal course of
                                    providing service.)

                                               EXAMPLE
                                               If an investment adviser provides a report to a client that is prepared by a third party,
                                               the adviser has a responsibility to disclose that fact to the client. By entering into
                                               an investment advisory agreement, the client relies on the expertise of the adviser
                                               to provide the advisory service. Thus, if the advice is provided by a third party, it is
                                               imperative that the adviser disclose this fact to the client so that the client is not
                                               misled. That would be something like turning in a term paper written by someone
                                               else and putting your name on it. The prohibition does not apply when an investment
                                               adviser gathers and uses research materials before making its recommendation to a
                                               client.

                                        Improper Trading Authorization
                                        No trade may be made without proper authorization from the advisory client or an authorized
                                        third party. The exam will frequently present a case where a client’s spouse or another third
                                        party such as a lawyer or an accountant contacts the firm with an order because the client is
                                        currently unavailable. If the required authorizations are not on file, the order must be refused.


                                        Lending or Borrowing
                                        Engaging in the practice of lending to or borrowing money or securities from a customer is
                                        considered an unethical business practice for all securities professionals.

                                        Securities professionals may not borrow money or securities from a client unless the client is a
                                        broker-dealer, an affiliate of the professional, or a financial institution engaged in the business
                                        of loaning money.

                                        Securities professionals may not loan money to clients unless the firm is a broker-dealer or
                                        financial institution engaged in the business of loaning funds, or the client is an affiliate.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     An IAR purchases a car from a retail client for $10,000 with a $3,000 down payment.
                                                     The balance is to be paid over the next 36 months. This is prohibited, because it is
                                                     borrowing money from a client who is not in the money-lending business.

                                                     TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                     As a former president of the United States once said, “Let me make one thing perfectly
                                                     clear.” When it comes to borrowing or lending money, you cannot borrow from any
                                                     client (including your mother) unless that client is a lending institution such as a
                                                     bank or credit union. Be careful—mortgage brokers are not in the business of lending
                                                     money; they put the borrower and the lender together, which is why they are called
                                                     brokers. Likewise, as an agent or IAR, you can never lend money to any client unless
                                                     the client has some kind of affiliation with your firm. If your broker-dealer handles
                                                     margin accounts, then, of course, money can be loaned to clients. Don’t take this
                                                     personally; just get the questions right on the exam.

                                                     EXAMPLE        Borrowing Money or Securities from Clients
                                                     One of the more confusing areas relates to borrowing money from (or lending money
                                                     to) clients. Part of the reason for the confusion is that FINRA rules (many students
                                                     taking the Series 65 exam have taken a FINRA test) permit borrowing (lending) to
                                                     clients under certain conditions that are more liberal than those of NASAA.
                                                     The first point to emphasize is that this prohibition only applies when the other side is
                                                     a client. Securities professionals may borrow (or lend) as much as they want to those
                                                     who are not clients, but once there is a client relationship, the NASAA policy takes
                                                     effect.

                                        So, which clients can you borrow from?
                                         A bank or other financial institution in the business of making loans (e.g., credit union)
                                         A broker-dealer in a margin account

                                    Which clients can’t you borrow from?
                                     The employee at the lending institution who processes or approves your loan
                                     The agent at the broker-dealer who services your margin account
                                     A mortgage broker (one who only arranges the loan)
                                     A family member

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   Lending arrangements between registered agents and their customers are permitted
                                                   if the customer
                                                      A. is a member of the representative’s immediate family.
                                                     B. is the mortgage broker who arranged for the mortgage on your home.
                                                     C. was your roommate in college and remains your best friend.
                                                     D. works at the desk next to yours.
                                                   Answer: D. You can borrow from or lend to another employee of your firm. You
                                                   can also borrow from clients who are in the money-lending business. Remember,
                                                   mortgage brokers don’t lend the money; they put together the lender and the
                                                   home buyer. If you’d like to borrow from an immediate family member, unless that
                                                   individual works for the same or an affiliated firm, the only way to do that is to
                                                   terminate the client relationship.


                                    Client Confidentiality
                                    Investment advisers and their representatives must respect the confidentiality of the
                                    relationship with their clients. It would be an unethical business practice to disclose the
                                    identity, affairs, or investments of any client unless required by law to do so, or unless
                                    consented to by the client.

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              An investment advisory firm has a responsibility to ensure that all information
                                              collected from a client be kept confidential. The only exception to the rule should be
                                              in those instances where the client or a joint owner authorizes the release of such
                                              information, or when the investment advisory firm is required by law to disclose such
                                              information.
                                                                                                                                                Unit 14
                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              If the advisory account is held in joint names, consent may be granted by any of the
                                              joint owners. On the exam, the most common example is from a spouse. Speaking of
                                              a spouse, the most common time when the firm could be required by law to disclose
                                              account information would be during a divorce proceeding in court. Another time
                                              would be during an IRS investigation, when you receive a subpoena from the court to
                                              testify.


                                    Conflicts of Interest
                                    SEC Release IA-1092 warns against effecting transactions in which the adviser has a personal
                                    interest in a manner that could result in preferring his own interest to that of his advisory
                                    clients.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     Some of the ways this applies are:
                                                      An investment adviser structures his personal securities transactions to trade on
                                                        the market impact caused by his recommendation to clients without disclosing
                                                        this to clients;
                                                      An investment adviser fails to disclose if his personal securities transactions are
                                                        inconsistent with advice given to his clients;
                                                      An investment adviser must disclose compensation received from the issuer of a
                                                        security being recommended; and
                                                      The SEC staff has taken the position that an investment adviser who sells
                                                        nonsecurities investments, such as insurance products, to clients must disclose
                                                        to clients and prospective clients all its interests in the sale of such nonsecurities
                                                        investments.


                                        LO 14.h Identify the kind of reporting required of investment
                                        advisers.

                                        In addition to the reporting related to updating Form ADV and the brochure, here are several
                                        other cases where investment advisers must report to the regulators.


                                        Section 13(f) Filings
                                        There is a reporting requirement that applies to SEC registered investment advisers.
                                        Section 13(f ) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires that any institutional
                                        investment manager that exercises investment discretion over an equity portfolio with a
                                        market value on the last trading day in any of the preceding 12 months of $100 million or
                                        more in 13(f ) securities must file a Form 13F with the SEC quarterly, within 45 days of the
                                        end of each quarter.

                                        The purpose of this rule is to require institutional investment managers who exercise
                                        investment discretion over accounts holding certain levels of securities to make periodic public
                                        disclosures of significant portfolio holdings.


                                        What Are 13(f) Securities?
                                        At the end of each calendar quarter, a list of these securities—called the Official List of
                                        Section 13(f ) Securities—may be found on the SEC’s website.

                                        Generally, the list includes exchange-traded (e.g., NYSE) or Nasdaq-quoted stocks, equity
                                        options and warrants, shares of closed-end investment companies, and certain convertible
                                        debt securities. Shares of open-end investment companies (i.e., mutual funds) are not
                                        included. Shares of exchange-traded funds (ETFs), however, are on the official list and would
                                        be reported on Form 13F.


                                        Investment Adviser Code of Ethics
                                        In order to ensure that investment advisers and their representatives will act in an ethical
                                        manner, all advisers are required to prepare a code of ethics. Although this code is part of the
                                        Investment Advisers Act of 1940, NASAA considers it binding on state-registered advisers as
                                        well. This code is under the jurisdiction of the chief compliance officer (CCO).

                                    Rule 204A1, Investment Adviser Code of Ethics, requires each adviser’s code of ethics to
                                    mandate that an adviser’s access persons (defined below) report their personal securities
                                    transactions and holdings to the adviser’s chief compliance officer or other designated persons.
                                    Access persons must each submit a holdings report:
                                     no later than 10 days after the person becomes an access person, and the information
                                       must be current as of a date no more than 45 days prior to the date the person becomes
                                       an access person.
                                     at least once each 12-month period thereafter on a date the adviser selects and the
                                       information must be current as of a date no more than 45 days prior to the date the
                                       report was submitted.

                                    Access persons must submit to the chief compliance officer or other persons designated in the
                                    firm’s code of ethics quarterly securities transactions reports within 30 days of the end of each
                                    quarter.

                                    The code of ethics must also require the CCO or her designee to review those reports.
                                    Reviewing these reports will allow advisers as well as the SEC’s examination staff to identify
                                    improper trades or patterns of trading by access persons.


                                    Access Person
                                    An access person is any of the adviser’s supervised persons who
                                     has access to nonpublic information regarding any clients’ purchase or sale of securities, or
                                       nonpublic information regarding the portfolio holdings of any reportable fund; or
                                     is involved in making securities recommendations to clients, or who has access to such
                                       recommendations that are nonpublic. If providing investment advice is the adviser’s
                                       primary business, all of the firm’s directors, officers, and partners are presumed to be
                                       access persons.

                                    The rule requires that the firm maintain a record of the names of persons who are currently,
                                    or have been within the past five years, access persons of the investment adviser. It is also
                                    required to keep a record of any decision, and the reasons supporting the decision, to approve
                                    the acquisition of securities by access persons for at least five years after the end of the fiscal
                                    year in which the approval is granted.


                                                                                                                                                Unit 14
                                    These procedures are designed to prevent violations by IARs and others in the firm who have
                                    access. Advisory firms should include the following elements, or address the following issues,
                                    when crafting their procedures for employees’ personal securities trading:
                                     Prior written approval before access persons can place a personal securities transaction
                                       (i.e., preclearance)
                                     Maintenance of lists of issuers of securities that the advisory firm is analyzing or
                                       recommending for client transactions, and prohibitions on personal trading in securities
                                       of those issuers. Remember, the regulators consider the use of a firm’s internal research
                                       prior to public release to be potential insider trading.
                                     Maintenance of restricted lists of issuers about which the advisory firm has inside
                                       information, and prohibitions on any trading (personal or for clients) in securities of
                                       those issuers
                                     Reminders that investment opportunities must be offered first to clients before the adviser
                                       or its employees may act on them, and procedures to implement this principle

                                        There are several exceptions where access persons may be permitted to trade in securities, such
                                        as when the person is participating in an automatic dividend reinvestment program (and does
                                        not alter the program to take advantage of the IA’s recommendations or other information),
                                        but it is unlikely that these will be tested.

                                                     TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                     Preapproval is necessary for an access person to acquire a beneficial interest in an
                                                     IPO or a private placement. Transaction reporting is not required when the security
                                                     purchased is any of the following:
                                                      Direct obligations of the government of the United States;
                                                      Bankers’ acceptances, bank certificates of deposit, commercial paper, or
                                                        high-quality short-term debt instruments, including repurchase agreements;
                                                      Shares issued by money market funds; or
                                                      Shares issued by open-end funds.

                                                     PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                          The primary business of ABC Advisers is providing investment advice. Therefore,
                                                          under the Code of Ethics, all of its directors, officers, and partners are
                                                           A. access persons.
                                                           B. automatically registered as investment adviser representatives.
                                                           C. required to post a surety bond.
                                                           D. prohibited in engaging in personal securities transactions other than in
                                                               U.S. government securities.
                                                          Answer: A. As stated previously, if providing investment advice is the adviser’s
                                                          primary business, all of the firm’s directors, officers, and partners are presumed to
                                                          be access persons. The automatic registration provision applies only to those who
                                                          function as IARs. There are no bonding requirements for IARs, and access persons
                                                          can engage in personal securities transactions under the conditions of the Code of
                                                          Ethics.


                                                     PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                          Alberto is an IAR with Exceptional Analysis and Results (EAR), an investment adviser
                                                          registered in three Southwestern states. Although Alberto relies heavily on the
                                                          recommendations furnished by EAR’s research department, he occasionally does his
                                                          own research for his personal account. As an access person, Alberto
                                                            A. would be prohibited from trading in his personal account.
                                                           B. would be prohibited from trading these securities in his personal account until
                                                                his research was made publicly available.
                                                            C. must report any personal transactions on a quarterly basis.
                                                           D. can only use personal research to benefit clients.
                                                          Answer: C. Alberto is considered an access person. As such, any personal securities
                                                          transactions must be reported on a quarterly basis. Alberto could not use research
                                                          reports developed by the firm until they were made publicly available, but his own
                                                          personal research doesn’t come under that requirement.

                                    Political Contributions by Investment Advisers (Pay to Play
                                    Rule)
                                    This is an SEC rule that prohibits investment advisers from receiving compensation for
                                    advisory services to a government entity (any agency, authority, or instrumentality of a state
                                    or political subdivision) for two years after the advisory firm or any covered associate makes
                                    a political contribution to a public official or candidate who is or would be in a position to
                                    influence the award of investment advisory business by public retirement funds. Please note
                                    that the advisory relationship can continue, just without any compensation. There are some
                                    exceptions, listed below.


                                    De Minimis Exception
                                    The rule allows covered associates to make contributions up to $350 per official or candidate
                                    per election in which they can vote, or $150 for other elections. Contributions by investment
                                    firms in any amount would trigger a violation of the rule.


                                    Covered Associates
                                    Covered individuals include:
                                     any general partner, managing member or executive officer, or other individual with a
                                       similar status or function;
                                     any employee who solicits a government entity for the investment adviser and
                                       any person who supervises, directly or indirectly, such an employee; and
                                     any political action committee controlled by the investment adviser.


                                    New Hire Exception
                                    When an investment adviser hires a new covered associate, political contributions made
                                    by that individual more than six months prior to coming on board do not trigger the ban.
                                    However, if the new person’s role is soliciting clients on behalf of the investment adviser,
                                    rather than rendering advice or other functions, this exception does not apply. In that case,
                                    there is a two-year “look back” period.


                                    Returned Contributions Exceptions                                                                         Unit 14
                                    An investment adviser can be excepted from the prohibition if the contribution is returned
                                    under certain conditions:
                                     The investment adviser must have discovered the contribution that resulted in the
                                       prohibition within four months of the date of such contribution;
                                     Such contribution must not have exceeded $350; and
                                     The contributor must obtain a return of the contribution within 60 calendar days of the
                                       date of discovery of such contribution by the investment adviser.

                                    Although unlikely to be tested, an investment adviser with more than 50 employees is entitled
                                    to no more than three exceptions, and one with 50 or fewer employees is limited to two
                                    exceptions during any single calendar year.

                                        Compliance Programs
                                        We have just completed a very comprehensive description of the many rules and regulations
                                        imposed upon investment advisers. How do the regulators ensure compliance with these
                                        rules? Effective October 2004, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 was amended to require
                                        each investment adviser registered with the SEC to adopt and implement written policies and
                                        procedures designed to prevent violation of the federal securities laws, review those policies
                                        and procedures annually for their adequacy and the effectiveness of their implementation,
                                        and designate a chief compliance officer (CCO) to be responsible for administering the
                                        policies and procedures. An adviser’s chief compliance officer should be competent and
                                        knowledgeable regarding the Advisers Act and should be empowered with full responsibility
                                        and authority to develop and enforce appropriate policies and procedures for the firm. Thus,
                                        the compliance officer should have a position of sufficient seniority and authority within
                                        the organization to compel others to adhere to the compliance policies and procedures. In
                                        fact, the CCO’s identity must be disclosed on Form ADV. However, the SEC does not set a
                                        standard of competency such as a specific qualification exam or number of years of experience.
                                        By and large, the states have followed suit for investment advisers registered with them.

                                        Under Rule 206(4)-7, it is unlawful for an investment adviser registered with the Commission
                                        to provide investment advice unless the adviser has adopted and implemented written policies
                                        and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violation of the Advisers Act by the adviser
                                        or any of its supervised persons. The rule requires advisers to consider their fiduciary and
                                        regulatory obligations under the Advisers Act and to formalize policies and procedures to
                                        address them.

                                        Each adviser, in designing its policies and procedures, should first identify conflicts and other
                                        compliance factors creating risk exposure for the firm and its clients in light of the firm’s
                                        particular operations, and then design policies and procedures that address those risks. The
                                        SEC and the Administrators expect that an adviser’s policies and procedures, at a minimum,
                                        should address the issues covered in this unit to the extent that they are relevant to that
                                        adviser.

                                        Although the rule requires only annual reviews, advisers should consider the need for interim
                                        reviews in response to significant compliance events, changes in business arrangements, and
                                        regulatory developments.

                                                     KNOWLEDGE CHECK 14.4
                                                     1.   An investment adviser who recommends the same security to a majority of her
                                                          clients is probably guilty of

             LESSON 14.5: ETHICAL BEHAVIOR OF BROKER-DEALERS AND THEIR
             AGENTS

                                    LO 14.i Recognize the requirements of the NASAA Statement of Policy
                                    on Dishonest and Unethical Practices of Broker-Dealers and Agents.

                                    NASAA’s policy lists many business practices that, when engaged in by broker-dealers or
                                    agents, are deemed dishonest or unethical. Subsequently, NASAA has issued several Model
                                    Rules that have expanded the list. Most students report seeing at least five questions on
                                    their Series 65 exam relating to this material. In most cases, the listed prohibition is logical
                                    common sense: “don’t lie, don’t cheat, and don’t steal.” However, due to the nature of this
                                    exam and their legal interpretations, particularly for those of you without a securities or law
                                    background, further explanations will be supplied.

                                    The premise of the policy is that each broker-dealer and agent shall observe high standards of
                                    commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade in the conduct of their business.
                                    Acts and practices, including but not limited to those enumerated below, are considered
                                    contrary to such standards and may constitute grounds for denial, suspension, or revocation
                                    of registration or such other action authorized by the Uniform Securities Act.


                                    Dishonest or Unethical Practices of Broker-Dealers and Agents
                                    Delivery Delays
                                    A broker-dealer engaging in a pattern of unreasonable and unjustifiable delays in the delivery
                                    of securities purchased by any of its customers and/or in the payment upon request of free
                                    credit balances reflecting completed transactions of any of its customers is unethical. A
                                    free credit balance is just like a credit balance on your charge card—it is your money and
                                    must be sent to you upon request. In the event that the client requests a certificate for the
                                    security purchased, it would be considered an unethical business practice for the firm to delay
                                    delivering it to the client.


                                    Unsuitable Recommendations
                                    Just as with investment advisers and their IARs, unethical activity includes recommending
                                    to a customer the purchase, sale, or exchange of any security without reasonable grounds to                 Unit 14
                                    believe that such a transaction or recommendation is suitable for the customer based upon
                                    reasonable inquiry concerning the customer’s investment objectives, financial situation and
                                    needs, and any other relevant information known by the securities professional.

                                    Securities professionals must always have reasonable grounds for making recommendations
                                    to clients. Before making recommendations, the securities professional must inquire into the
                                    client’s financial status, investment objectives, and ability to assume financial risk. What about
                                    the client who refuses to give any financial information or discuss objectives? In that case, all a
                                    broker-dealer or agent can do is accept unsolicited orders, because there is no basis for making
                                    any recommendation. As far as investment advisers and their representatives are concerned,
                                    because they are paid for their advice, if they don’t have the requisite information, they won’t
                                    open the advisory account.

                                                     So, what do you do when you think you’ve made a totally appropriate
                                                     recommendation to your client, but your client is not happy with it? Upon
                                                     reflection, you realize the client’s problem is a lack of understanding of both the
                                                     recommendation and the marketplace. What should you do? Most would agree that
                                                     the first step would be to attempt to impart some education to the client in an effort to
                                                     make your recommendation clearer. However, as with all customer issues, the client is
                                                     the one who has to make the final decision.


                                        Free Lunch Seminars
                                        Although not specifically included in the NASAA Statement of Policy, a Model Rule regarding
                                        unfair business practices, especially with regard to seniors, may be included on your exam. The
                                        most common instance is the so-called free lunch seminar. These seminars are widely offered
                                        by financial services firms seeking to sell financial products, and they often include a free
                                        meal for attendees. Even though many of these seminars are promoted as being educational
                                        or workshops accompanied by the statement (“nothing will be sold at this meeting”) the
                                        seminars are clearly intended to result in the attendees’ opening new accounts with the
                                        sponsoring firm and, ultimately, in the sale of investment products, if not at the seminar itself,
                                        then in follow-up contacts with the attendees.

                                        If not clearly presented, NASAA will consider that both the sponsoring firm and those
                                        individuals involved in the delivery of the seminar are committing a prohibited business
                                        practice.


                                        Churning
                                        Churning is generally defined as inducing trading in a customer’s account that is excessive in
                                        size or frequency in view of the financial resources, objectives, and character of the account
                                        for the purpose of generating commissions. A key here is the word excessive. By definition,
                                        anytime something is excessive, it is too much. The regulators understand that different
                                        clients have different needs and abilities to take risks, so what is excessive for the 80-year-old
                                        pensioner is probably not going to be so for the 40-year-old partner in a major law firm.

                                                     TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                     Excessive trading may be used on the exam instead of the word churning.


                                        Unfair Pricing
                                        A broker-dealer would be engaging in an unethical business practice when entering into a
                                        transaction with or for a customer at a price not reasonably related to the current market price
                                        of the security or receiving an unreasonable commission or profit. This is particularly an issue
                                        with stocks that trade infrequently on marketplaces such as the OTC Link®.


                                        Withholding Shares of a Public Offering
                                        Failing to make a bona fide public offering of all of the securities allotted to a broker-dealer
                                        for distribution, whether acquired as an underwriter, as a selling group member, or from
                                        a member participating in the distribution as an underwriter or selling group member, is

                                                                                           Unit 14   Ethical Practices and Obligations   331


                                    unethical. If the firm is fortunate to be part of the underwriting of one of these IPOs that
                                    skyrockets in price because the issue is oversubscribed, they’d better be sure to allocate the
                                    shares to clients in an equitable manner and not keep any for themselves.


                                    Responding to Complaints
                                    Failing or refusal to furnish a customer, upon reasonable request, information to which he is
                                    entitled, or to respond to a formal written request or complaint, is unethical.

                                    When a written complaint is received by the firm (and only written complaints are
                                    recognized), action must be taken. The complainant (customer) would be notified that the
                                    complaint had been received and an entry would be made in the firm’s complaint file. If an
                                    agent were the subject of the complaint, the agent would be notified but would not be given
                                    a copy of the complaint (agents do not have recordkeeping requirements). If the complaint
                                    is received by the agent rather than the firm, the agent must report the complaint to the
                                    appropriate supervisor. If the complaint is sent by email, that is considered in writing.

                                               TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                               A complaint received by electronic means (email) is considered a written complaint.

                                               EXAMPLE
                                               A customer is upset with her agent for not servicing her account properly and sends him
                                               a complaint via text message about her actions. Under the Uniform Securities Act, the
                                               agent should
                                               A. call the customer, apologize, and attempt to correct the problem.
                                               B. tell the customer he is willing to make rescission.
                                               C. do nothing because the complaint is not in writing.
                                               D. bring the customer complaint to his employer immediately.
                                               Answer: D. Any written customer complaint (an email or text message is considered
                                               written) must be brought to the attention of the agent’s supervisor without hesitation.


                                               TAKE NOTE
                                               Written complaints must be kept on file by broker-dealers for three years and
                                               by investment advisers for five years. Do not confuse this with FINRA’s four-year

                                                                                                                                                 Unit 14
                                               requirement; this is a NASAA exam.


                                    Reporting Errors
                                    In order to keep from generating complaints, any trade or other operational error, once
                                    discovered, must be reported by the agent to the appropriate supervisory person.


                                    Front Running
                                    Front running is the unethical business practice of a securities professional placing a personal
                                    order ahead of a previously received customer order. It occurs most frequently when the firm
                                    has received an institutional order of sufficient size to move the market. By running in front
                                    of the order, the firm or agent can profit on that movement. This may also be called trading
                                    ahead.

                                        Spreading Rumors
                                        Any agent or IAR hearing a rumor must report it to the appropriate supervisor. Firms must
                                        ensure that rumors they become aware of are not spread or used in any way, particularly not as
                                        the basis for recommendations.

                                                     PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                          An agent hears a rumor concerning a security and uses the rumor to convince a client
                                                          to purchase the security. Under the Uniform Securities Act, the agent may
                                                            A. recommend the security if it is an appropriate investment.
                                                           B. recommend the investment if the rumor is based on material inside
                                                               information.
                                                           C. recommend the security if the rumor came from a reliable source.
                                                           D. not recommend the security.
                                                          Answer: D. Rumors must be promptly reported to the appropriate supervisory
                                                          personnel and may never be used as the basis for a recommendation.


                                        Backdating Records
                                        All records and documents must reflect their actual dates. Although there can be tax or other
                                        benefits to clients when their trade confirmations are backdated, it is an unethical business
                                        practice to do so.


                                        Lending or Borrowing Securities or Money
                                        The rules are essentially the same as for investment advisers, with the exception that any
                                        broker-dealer offering margin accounts is authorized to lend to customers and borrow
                                        securities for short sales.


                                        Breakpoint Sales
                                        Review the discussion at LO 3.c for an understanding of this unethical business practice.


                                        Practices Relating Solely to Agents
                                        Fictitious Accounts
                                        Establishing or maintaining an account containing fictitious information in order to execute
                                        transactions that would otherwise be prohibited is unethical. Examples of this kind of conduct
                                        sometimes given on the exam are “beefing up” a client’s net worth to enable him to engage in
                                        margin or options trading, or making him appear to have more investment experience than is
                                        true.


                                        Sharing in Accounts
                                        Sharing directly or indirectly in profits or losses in the account of any customer without
                                        the written authorization of the customer and the broker-dealer that the agent represents is
                                        unethical.

                                        Agents cannot share in the profits or losses of client accounts unless the client and the
                                        broker-dealer supply prior written approval. In such a situation, it would be permissible to
                                        commingle the agent’s and the customer’s funds if they have a joint account. Unlike FINRA

                                    rules, a joint account is not required, nor is the sharing required to be proportionate to the
                                    agent’s financial contribution.

                                               TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                               Unlike agents, broker-dealers, investment advisers, and investment adviser
                                               representatives are never permitted to share in the profits or losses in their client’s
                                               accounts.


                                    Splitting Commissions
                                    Dividing or otherwise splitting the agent’s commissions, profits, or other compensation from
                                    the purchase or sale of securities with any person not also registered as an agent for the same
                                    broker-dealer, or for a broker-dealer under direct or indirect common control, is unethical.
                                    Interestingly enough, they can do this without disclosing the split to their clients unless it
                                    increases the transaction cost to the client. This is one of the very rare cases where disclosure is
                                    not necessary.


                                    Selling Away (Private Securities Transactions)
                                    Effecting securities transactions not recorded on the regular books or records of the
                                    broker-dealer that the agent represents, unless the transactions are authorized in writing by the
                                    broker-dealer prior to execution of the transaction, is unethical.

                                               TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                               The exam may refer to this as a trade made off the books of the broker-dealer. Just
                                               remember that it is considered to be a prohibited practice anytime an agent engages
                                               in a securities transaction not recorded on the regular books or records of the
                                               broker-dealer that the agent represents, unless the transaction is authorized in writing
                                               by the broker-dealer before execution of the transaction.

                                               EXAMPLE
                                               An agent was approached at a party by a friend and was asked if she knew anyone
                                               who might like to invest in a movie the friend was making. One of the agent’s clients


                                                                                                                                                   Unit 14
                                               was there and was interested, so much so that he ended up writing a check for
                                               $50,000. When the investor received his next account statement, he called the agent’s
                                               broker-dealer because he didn’t see the $50,000. The call was escalated up to the
                                               compliance officer, and the agent lost her license for selling away—engaging in a
                                               transaction “off the books” of the firm without prior authorization.


                                    Agent’s Account at a Different Broker-Dealer
                                    Although unusual, there are cases where an agent registered with a broker-dealer will open
                                    an account at another broker-dealer. The most common case is when that other BD offers a
                                    product that is not available at the agent’s firm. Under the rule, no person associated with a
                                    broker-dealer shall, without the prior written consent of that BD, open or otherwise establish
                                    at a broker-dealer other than the employer BD any account in which securities transactions
                                    can be effected and in which the associated person has a beneficial interest. The requirements
                                    of this rule do not apply to transactions in unit investment trusts, municipal fund securities
                                    (529 plans) variable contracts, or redeemable securities of companies registered under the
                                    Investment Company Act (e.g., variable annuities/life and mutual funds).

                                        LO 14.j Identify the requirements when selling securities on the
                                        premises of financial institutions.


                                        Sales of Securities at Financial Institutions
                                        The 1990s saw a proliferation of broker-dealer services being offered on the premises of
                                        financial institutions, particularly banks. In response to the potential for confusion as well
                                        as conflicts of interest, NASAA prepared Model Rules for sales of securities at financial
                                        institutions. Here are the key points for you to know.

                                        No broker-dealer shall conduct broker-dealer services on the premises of a financial institution
                                        where retail deposits (deposits from ordinary customers like you and me) are taken unless the
                                        broker-dealer complies initially and continuously with the following requirements.


                                        Setting
                                        Wherever practical, broker-dealer services should be conducted in a physical location
                                        distinct from the area in which the financial institution’s retail deposits are taken. In
                                        situations where there is insufficient space to allow separate areas, the broker-dealer has a
                                        heightened responsibility to distinguish its services from those of the financial institution.
                                        The broker-dealer’s name should be clearly displayed in the area in which the broker-dealer
                                        conducts its services.


                                        Customer Disclosure and Written Acknowledgment
                                        At or prior to the time that a customer’s securities brokerage account is opened by a
                                        broker-dealer on the premises of a financial institution where retail deposits are taken, the
                                        broker-dealer must:
                                         disclose, orally and in writing, that the securities products purchased or sold in a
                                           transaction with the broker-dealer
                                             –– are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC),
                                             –– are not deposits or other obligations of the financial institution and are not
                                                guaranteed by the financial institution, and
                                             –– are subject to investment risks, including possible loss of the principal invested; and
                                         make reasonable efforts to obtain from each customer, during the account opening
                                           process, a written acknowledgment of the disclosures.


                                        Communications with the Public
                                        The following logo format disclosures may be used by a broker-dealer in advertisements
                                        and sales literature, including material published or designed for use in radio or television
                                        broadcasts, automated teller machine (ATM) screens, billboards, signs, posters, and
                                        brochures, to comply with the requirements, provided that such disclosures are displayed in a
                                        conspicuous manner:

                                    As long as the omission of the disclosures would not cause the advertisement or sales literature
                                    to be misleading in light of the context in which the material is presented, such disclosures are
                                    not required with respect to messages contained in:
                                     radio broadcasts of 30 seconds or less;
                                     electronic signs, including billboard-type signs that are electronic, time and temperature
                                       signs, and ticker tape signs, but excluding messages contained in such media as television,
                                       online computer services, or ATMs; and
                                     signs, such as banners and posters, when used only as location indicators.

                                               KNOWLEDGE CHECK 14.5
                                               1.   On occasion, two registered agents cooperate on a sale. In that case, the
                                                    commissions earned may be split in all of the following cases except
                                                     A. when the agents are not registered with the same or an affiliated broker-dealer.
                                                     B. when one of the individuals is the other’s supervisor.
                                                     C. when consent to the split was not obtained from the customer.
                                                     D. when only one of the individuals has made an investment into the account.
                                               2.   The regulators are concerned when a broker-dealer operates on the premises of
                                                    a financial institution. However, the rules only apply when which of the following
                                                    activities takes place on those premises?
                                                     A. Personal loans are made
                                                     B. Retail deposits are taken
                                                     C. Mortgage loan applications are accepted
                                                     D. Safe deposit boxes are available


             LESSON 14.6: POTENTIAL CRIMINAL ACTIVITIES

                                    LO 14.k Recognize potential criminal activities applying to all
                                    securities professionals.

                                    As with the previous learning objectives, it is easiest to list the criminal activities of securities
                                    professionals with explanations or comments.


                                    Using Inside Information                                                                                      Unit 14

                                    Because the potential rewards are so great, using inside information is one of the most
                                    commonly violated rules by both investors and securities professionals. Some go to extreme
                                    lengths to try to hide the activity in an effort to make it difficult to uncover. Making
                                    recommendations on the basis of material inside information about an issuer or its securities
                                    is prohibited. Should an agent or IAR come into possession of inside information, she must
                                    report the possession of the information to a supervisor or compliance officer. Even the use
                                    of a broker-dealer or investment adviser’s internally generated research report prior to public
                                    release can be considered use of inside information.

                                               TAKE NOTE
                                               Material nonpublic inside information (MNPI) under securities law is any
                                               information about a company that has not been communicated to the general public
                                               and that would likely affect the value of a security. Even if you acquire the information
                                               “accidentally,” you cannot use it until it becomes public.

          336        Unit 14    Ethical Practices and Obligations



                                        An insider or control person is defined as an officer, director, or owner of more than 10% of
                                        the voting stock of the company, or the immediate family of any of these persons. After the
                                        tremendous insider abuses of the mid-1980s, the SEC took steps to beef up its enforcement
                                        of insider trading; hence this act. This act incorporated all of the other prohibitions against
                                        the activities of insiders and the use of inside information and also increased the penalties
                                        that could be levied and made the recipient of inside information as guilty as the insider who
                                        passed on that information. In other words, the tippee would be just as guilty as the tipper.

                                        An insider is in violation of SEC rules when he trades securities on the basis of material
                                        nonpublic information (MNPI) or when he passes on this information to another who
                                        subsequently acts on it. It is critical to remember that no chargeable violation has occurred
                                        unless a transaction has taken place.

                                        Even persons who do not meet the definition of an insider are subject to the rules governing
                                        the use of nonpublic information and could be liable for any actions taken. When it comes
                                        to who could potentially be an insider—that is, who could possibly possess material inside
                                        information—the list is virtually endless. One could therefore say that a potential insider
                                        could be anyone coming across information dealing with a company, other than those
                                        individuals who, by virtue of their title or other circumstance, are definitely insiders.


                                        The Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988
                                        (ITSFEA)
                                        This act gave the SEC authority to seek civil penalties against persons violating the provisions
                                        of the act in amounts up to the greater of $1 million or treble damages. Treble damages
                                        means that the guilty party could be fined up to three times any ill-gotten gains or up to three
                                        times any losses avoided by using inside information to get out before a market drop. The
                                        Federal Civil Penalties Inflation Adjustment Act of 2015 changed the way the civil penalty
                                        is applied for insider trading. The new penalties were applied as of August 1, 2016. The
                                        $1,000,000 is now indexed for inflation to $1,978,690 and represents the maximum civil
                                        penalty for insider trading to be compared to the treble damages. Historically, the exam stays
                                        away from numbers that change such as this one.
                                        These civil penalties are in addition to any disgorgement of profits made or losses avoided
                                        as a result of the insider trading. From this fine, the SEC is authorized to award bounties to
                                        informants. If the SEC should elect to pursue criminal action, then penalties would include
                                        potential jail time with a maximum sentence of 20 years.


                                        Chinese Wall Doctrine
                                        It is plain that regulators wish to maintain a level playing field for all, and if those with
                                        material nonpublic information were to let it leak out to favored interests, a prohibited
                                        activity would be taking place. This is particularly an issue with those broker-dealers who
                                        engage in investment banking, especially mergers and acquisitions. In order to do their
                                        job, they must have access to confidential information that is not publicly available—at
                                        least not yet. Therefore, in order to ensure that this information does not become available,
                                        for example, to the research department or the retail sales staff, these firms must erect
                                        (figuratively) a wall as impenetrable as the Great Wall of China between these departments.
                                        In essence, Chinese Wall is the term used to describe the procedures followed by these firms to
                                        insulate information from reaching the wrong hands.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              Although you might see the term Chinese Wall on your exam, the preferred term in the
                                              industry is information barrier.

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              As an example of the type of returns that can be made, Mr. H, a convenience store
                                              employee, has a sister whose boyfriend worked for a company that was about to be
                                              bought out by another company. The boyfriend mentioned that to the sister, who in
                                              turn told her brother. The day before the announcement was made public, Mr. H. took
                                              his life savings of $8,000 and invested in options in that company. The next day, after
                                              the announcement and the jump in price, he sold and reaped a profit of over $295,000
                                              (almost 37 times his investment in one trading day). Yes, he was caught (which is how
                                              we know the story) and had to return his profits and then some interest.
                                              Another case involved getting access to a law firm’s computer. The law firm specialized
                                              in mergers and acquisitions, and those with access were able to learn of upcoming
                                              takeover bids being made at prices significantly higher than the current trading price.
                                              To avoid being noticed, the trades were placed through the account of the mother
                                              of one of the participants, who was based in China. Total penalties in this case were
                                              almost $6 million plus interest of about $125,000.
                                              In our first example, Mr. H wasn’t looking for the information, but when it came his
                                              way, he used it. In the second example, the perpetrators hacked into the computers
                                              with malice aforethought.

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  Which of the following employees of a publicly traded company would most likely
                                                  have access to MNPI?
                                                   A. VP of Human Resources
                                                   B. Receptionist
                                                   C. Chief Financial Officer (CFO)
                                                   D. VP of Marketing
                                                  Answer: C. Although any of these employees could obtain access to MNPI, because
                                                  the CFO is the individual who sees the financial numbers first, it is part of the job to
                                                  have access to earnings numbers before anyone else.

                                              The exam may ask you to identify who is guilty of insider trading violations—a
                                              corporate officer of the issuer who divulges material inside information to a friend,
                                              but no transaction takes place, or an agent who executes a trade for a client who is
                                              acting on inside information? Simply giving someone inside information, although
                                              imprudent, is not a violation of the law. Only when the information is used for trading
                                              does a violation occur. In our question, the agent is in violation for accepting an order
                                              on the basis of material nonpublic information that results in a trade.


                                    Market Manipulation
                                    Effecting any transaction in, or inducing the purchase or sale of, any security by means of any
                                    manipulative, deceptive, or fraudulent device, practice, plan, program, design, or contrivance
                                    is generally considered a fraudulent practice.

          338        Unit 14    Ethical Practices and Obligations



                                        Securities legislation is designed to uphold the integrity of markets and transactions in
                                        securities. However, market integrity is violated when transactions misrepresent actual
                                        securities prices or market activity. The most common forms of market manipulation are
                                        matched orders and wash trades.


                                        Matched Orders
                                        These occur when an order to buy or sell securities is entered with knowledge that a matching
                                        order on the opposite side of the transaction has been or will be entered for the purpose of
                                        (1) creating a false or misleading appearance of active trading in any publicly traded security
                                        or (2) creating a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for any such
                                        security.

                                        Increased volume in a security can induce unsuspecting investors to purchase the security,
                                        thereby bidding up the price. As the price rises, participants who initiated the matched orders
                                        sell their securities at a profit.


                                        Wash Trades
                                        This is an order to buy or sell securities resulting in no change of beneficial ownership for
                                        the purpose of (1) creating a false or misleading appearance of active trading in any publicly
                                        traded security or (2) creating a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for
                                        any such security. This is typically done by an investor buying in one brokerage account and
                                        simultaneously selling through another. No real change in ownership has occurred, but to the
                                        marketplace, it appears that volume and/or price is increasing.

                                                     TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                     A wash sale for tax purposes is not related to this in any way. A wash sale for tax
                                                     purposes occurs when a person sells a security and repurchases it within 30 days prior
                                                     to or after the sale—this is covered in Unit 15 of this course.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     An industry term used to describe this increased volume and/or price caused by
                                                     matched orders and wash trades is painting the tape. The term is derived from the old
                                                     days when market activity was reported on ticker tape.

                                        Accurate recording of orders and subsequent trades is one way that regulators monitor for
                                        attempts to manipulate the market.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     So, what is the difference between a matched order and a wash trade? Keeping it
                                                     simple (because the exam only wants you to know they’re both illegal), wash trades
                                                     are trades in which the (natural or legal) person who is the beneficial owner of the
                                                     traded securities does not change, even though this is the impression conveyed to
                                                     the public. In other words, in a wash trade, it is the same investor trading in two or
                                                     more accounts owned or controlled by that single investor. In the case of matched
                                                     orders, these are prearranged entries of equal but opposite buy and sell orders in
                                                     the same security made between different parties with the intention to distort the
                                                     public impression of actual liquidity or prices. There is a change in ownership, but the
                                                     attempt is to deceive.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              Arbitrage is the simultaneous buying and selling of the same security in different
                                              markets to take advantage of different prices; it is not a form of market manipulation.
                                              Simultaneously buying a security in one market and selling it in another forces prices
                                              to converge and, therefore, provides uniform prices for the general public.

                                              1.   A company leaks some inside information to some key employees but not the
                                                   public. One of those employees tells the agent servicing his brokerage account, and
                                                   the agent tells another customer who trades on the information before it becomes
                                                   public. In this situation, who would be guilty of insider trading?

                                                     D. I, II, III, and IV
                                              2.   An investor receives an unsolicited email about a startup company trading for
                                                   pennies. The email notes that a patent for a new technology is forthcoming and
                                                   investors need to get in now. The next day the investor sees lots of information on
                                                   the same stock in an internet chat room. The hype seems to be similar to what was
                                                   received in the email blast. Being cautious, the investor senses that this could be
                                                     A. an effort to spread market rumors in an attempt to manipulate the stock.
                                                     B. a front running scheme to get ahead of large buy orders.
                                                     C. an attempt to generate commissions by churning investors’ accounts.
                                                     D. a fraudster attempting to peg the price of the stock.


             LESSON 14.7: PROTECTING CUSTOMER DATA

                                    LO 14.l Recognize that securities professionals must practice good
                                    cybersecurity, privacy, and data protection.

                                                                                                                                                Unit 14
                                    Cybersecurity, Data Protection, and Privacy
                                    Hardly a day goes by without news of a hacking attempt that has compromised the security of
                                    a company, its clients, or both. There are steps that can be taken by securities professionals to
                                    reduce the potential for loss to the firm and its clients.


                                    Cybersecurity
                                    In September 2014, NASAA released results of a pilot survey designed to better understand
                                    the cybersecurity practices of state-registered investment advisers. Based on that survey, in
                                    setting up a cybersecurity program, NASAA suggests addressing the following points:
                                     Cyber preparedness: Has the firm addressed which cybersecurity threats and
                                       vulnerabilities may impact its business?
                                     Cybersecurity compliance program: Does the firm have written policies, procedures, or
                                       training programs in place regarding safeguarding client information?

                                         Cybersecurity and social media: Does the firm have written policies, procedures, or
                                           training programs in place relating to the use of social media for business purposes
                                           (e.g., Linkedin, Twitter, Facebook)?
                                         Cyber insurance: Does the firm maintain insurance coverage for cybersecurity?
                                         Cyber expertise: Has the firm engaged an outside consultant to provide cybersecurity
                                           services for your firm?
                                         Cyber confidentiality: Does the firm have confidentiality agreements with any third-party
                                           service providers with access to the firm’s information technology systems?
                                         Cyber incident: Has the firm ever experienced a cybersecurity incident where,
                                           directly or indirectly, theft, loss, unauthorized exposure, use of, or access to customer
                                           information occurred? If so, has the firm taken steps to close any gaps in its cybersecurity
                                           infrastructure?
                                         Cyber disposal: Does the firm have a procedure for the disposal of electronic data storage
                                           devices?
                                         Cyber continuation: What are the plans for the firm’s continued operation during a
                                           cyber-event or cybersecurity incident?
                                         Cyber losses: Are there plans for treating the loss of electronic devices (e.g., loss of a
                                           laptop containing personal and confidential client information)?
                                         Cybersecurity safeguards: Does the firm use safeguards, such as encryption and antivirus
                                           or antimalware programs? Does the firm contact clients via email or other electronic
                                           messaging, and if so, does the firm use secure email or any procedures to authenticate
                                           client instructions received via email or electronic messaging to work against the
                                           possibility of a client being impersonated?


                                        Safeguarding Client Information
                                        Broker-dealers have a great deal of information about their clients that would be highly
                                        valuable to persons with evil intentions. Our primary concern here is with identity theft,
                                        which may be used to falsify client requests for funds and/or securities. In order to combat
                                        identity theft, securities professionals must be aware of the red flags.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     Identity theft means a fraud committed or attempted using the identifying information
                                                     of another person without authority. Red flag means a pattern, practice, or specific
                                                     activity that indicates the possible existence of identity theft.

                                        The regulators are concerned when broker-dealers (or other financial professionals) maintain
                                        what are referred to as “covered accounts.” The term covered account is defined as:
                                         an account that a financial institution offers or maintains—primarily for personal, family,
                                           or household purposes—that involves or is designed to permit multiple payments or
                                           transactions (not a business account—it is felt that there is much less identity theft risk
                                           there); or
                                         any other account that the financial institution offers or maintains for which there is a
                                           reasonably foreseeable risk to customers or to the safety and soundness of the financial
                                           institution from identity theft, including financial, operational, compliance, reputation,
                                           or litigation risks.

                                                                                         Unit 14   Ethical Practices and Obligations   341


                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              The definition includes a margin account as an example of a covered account. Also
                                              included is a brokerage account with a broker-dealer or an account maintained by
                                              a mutual fund (or its agent) that permits wire transfers or other payments to third
                                              parties.

                                    Investment advisers who have the ability to direct transfers or payments from accounts
                                    belonging to individuals to third parties upon the individuals’ instructions, or who act as
                                    agents on behalf of the individuals, are susceptible to the same types of risks of fraud as other
                                    financial institutions. Individuals who hold accounts with these investment advisers bear the
                                    same types of risks of identity theft and loss of assets as consumers holding accounts with
                                    other financial institutions. If such an adviser does not have a program in place to verify
                                    investors’ identities and detect identity theft red flags, another individual may deceive the
                                    adviser by posing as an investor.

                                    It is required that each financial institution that offers or maintains one or more covered
                                    accounts must develop and implement a written program designed to detect, prevent, and
                                    mitigate identity theft in connection with the opening of a covered account or any existing
                                    covered account. These provisions also require that each program be appropriate to the size
                                    and complexity of the financial institution and the nature and scope of its activities.

                                    The program must include reasonable policies and procedures to:
                                     identify relevant red flags for the covered accounts that the financial institution offers or
                                       maintains and incorporate those red flags into its program;
                                     detect red flags that have been incorporated into the program of the financial institution;
                                     respond appropriately to any red flags that are detected to prevent and mitigate identity
                                       theft; and
                                     ensure the program (including the red flags determined to be relevant) is updated
                                       periodically to reflect changes in risks to customers and to the safety and soundness of the
                                       financial institution or creditor from identity theft.


                                    Identity Theft Red Flags
                                    Following is a list of some of the most common warnings that firms should include in their
                                                                                                                                               Unit 14
                                    identity theft programs as is appropriate to the nature of the firm’s business:
                                     Alerts, notifications, or other warnings received from consumer reporting agencies or
                                       service providers, such as fraud detection services or a notice of credit freeze in response to
                                       a request for a consumer report;
                                     Presentation of suspicious documents, such as documents that appear to have been altered
                                       or forged;
                                     The photograph or physical description on the identification is not consistent with the
                                       appearance of the applicant or customer presenting the identification;
                                     Presentation of suspicious personal identifying information, such as a suspicious address
                                       change;
                                     Unusual use of, or other suspicious activity related to, a covered account;
                                     Notice from customers, victims of identity theft, law enforcement authorities, or other
                                       persons regarding possible identity theft in connection with covered accounts held by the
                                       financial institution;

                                         Personal identifying information provided by the customer is not consistent with other
                                           personal identifying information provided by the customer (e.g., there is a lack of
                                           correlation between the Social Security number range and date of birth);
                                         Personal identifying information provided is of a type commonly associated with
                                           fraudulent activity as indicated by internal or third-party sources used by the financial
                                           institution. For example,
                                             –– the address on an application is fictitious or is of a mail drop or a prison, or
                                             –– the phone number is invalid or is associated with a pager or an answering service;
                                         For financial institutions that use challenge questions (what is the name of your first
                                           pet?, etc.), the person opening the covered account or the customer cannot provide
                                           authenticating information beyond that which generally would be available from a wallet
                                           or consumer report; and
                                         Mail sent to the customer is returned repeatedly as undeliverable, although transactions
                                           continue to be conducted in connection with the customer’s covered account.

                                        Please note that this is not meant to be an exhaustive list. Your firm will make you aware of
                                        its program and the specific red flags they are addressing. The exam is more concerned about
                                        the concept than an actual list, although you should be able to recognize obvious patterns of
                                        misuse in an account.

                                                          A great concern to broker-dealers is the theft of the identity of a client. To reduce the
                                                          possibility of a client’s assets being improperly taken, most firms would consider all
                                                          of these to be red flags except
                                                            A. almost one year since your last contact with your client, you receive a phone
                                                               call requesting that funds be wired to an offshore account.
                                                            B. a client regularly visits your office to pick up a check representing the proceeds
                                                               of recently settled transactions.
                                                            C. when running a credit report on a new client’s application, there is a
                                                               discrepancy between the home address listed on the report and the one on
                                                               the new account form.
                                                            D. the photograph on the identification documents provided does not resemble
                                                               the individual opening the account.
                                                          Answer: B. There is nothing wrong with a client picking up a check for the proceeds
                                                          of a securities transaction, even if done on a regular basis (some folks don’t trust the
                                                          mail). Each of the other choices should raise a red flag as being something needing
                                                          further investigation.


                                        Methods for Protecting the Firm and Its Customers
                                        What are the methods of authentication used by customers or employees to access electronic
                                        data storage devices that allow access to client communications, client information, or both?

                                         Dual-factor authentication (e.g., key fobs, secure IDs)
                                         Adaptive-factor authentication (e.g., challenge questions)

                                                                                           Unit 14   Ethical Practices and Obligations   343


                                    Some questions to ask regarding the security methods used include the following:
                                     How often are updates downloaded to antivirus software?
                                     Does your firm utilize encryption on its files or devices?
                                     Does your firm utilize online or remote backup of electronic files?
                                     Does your firm allow remote access to servers or workstations via a virtual private network
                                       (VPN) or similar technology?
                                     Does your firm use free Cloud services, such as iCloud, Dropbox, or Google Drive, to
                                       store personal and confidential client information?
                                     Does your firm utilize your firm’s website to use or access client information data?
                                     Does your firm’s website include a client portal?
                                    As you can see from the many questions posed, protecting data is not a simple issue. Although
                                    the decision as to what will be used and how it will be used is that of the firm, agents must
                                    be aware of the tools being employed and how they work. That is why so much emphasis is
                                    placed on initial and continual training.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              Broker-dealers and investment advisers backing up client data should make sure it is
                                              encrypted.


                                    Privacy: Regulation S-P
                                    Regulation S-P, mandated by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, requires that firms take identity
                                    theft seriously and have adequate safeguards in the form of privacy policies to protect
                                    nonpublic personal information from unauthorized access or use. Member firms must provide
                                    an initial privacy notice to new customers when an account is opened and must provide an
                                    annual privacy notice to all customers. Regulation S-P permits firms to disclose nonpublic
                                    personal information to unaffiliated third parties unless the customer has elected to opt out
                                    of the disclosure. Examples of nonpublic personal information include a customer’s Social
                                    Security number, account balances, transaction history, the fact that the individual was at one
                                    time a customer, and any information collected through a consumer reporting agency or an
                                    internet cookie. Furthermore, the regulation requires that the customer be given 30 days to
                                    opt out before disclosure of nonpublic personal information may be made.
                                                                                                                                                 Unit 14
                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              An internet cookie is created with a view that allows the member firm to collect
                                              information about the customer and is an example that illustrates one of the many
                                              ways that any financial institution may obtain information about a consumer in
                                              connection with providing a financial product or service to that specific consumer.
                                              If the information is not specific, it is known as blind data or aggregate information
                                              that contains no personal identifiers. It is not deemed to be personally identifiable
                                              information and, therefore, not subject to Regulation S-P requirements.

                                    Regulation S-P distinguishes between a consumer and a customer. A consumer is an
                                    individual who obtains a financial product or service from a firm and has no further contact
                                    with the firm. A customer is an individual who has an ongoing relationship with a firm.
                                    Consumers are given an initial privacy notice only, while customers must be given both an
                                    initial and an annual privacy notice. Only individuals, not businesses or institutions, are
                                    covered by the regulation.

                                        Regulation S-P also requires members to adopt policies and procedures that provide adequate
                                        safeguards of confidential customer information and records. Not a month goes by without a
                                        headline of a major break in security at a large company. Technological advancements, such
                                        as public access WiFi, present many confidentiality issues for firms. Among the many security
                                        concerns is that data are broadcast out into the airwaves, making interception easier. Wireless
                                        connections present an attractive mechanism for hackers to tap into the user’s workstation
                                        to gain access to the corporate network. Before permitting employees to access customer
                                        information remotely, members must implement and update appropriate measures to secure
                                        customer information. These measures may need to go far beyond a firewall and off-the-shelf
                                        defensive software to stay ahead of criminals who want to access your systems.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     Reasonable opt-out methods available to members include providing a reply form
                                                     with the opt-out notice, an electronic means to opt out if the customer has agreed to
                                                     the electronic delivery of information, and a toll-free number that customers may call.
                                                     The SEC has stated that members are not providing a reasonable means to opt out if
                                                     the only method to do so is by writing a letter to the member.

                                                     PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                          Under Regulation S-P, if an investment adviser sends a customer an initial privacy
                                                          notice that contains an opt-out provision, the firm may not disclose nonpublic
                                                          personal information about that customer for how many days from the mailing?

                                                           D. 30
                                                          Answer: D. An investment adviser (or broker-dealer) must give a customer 30 days to
                                                          implement any opt-out provision in the privacy notice.

             LESSON 14.8: BUSINESS CONTINUITY AND SUCCESSION
                                    As mentioned previously several times, NASAA does not have a separate principal’s
                                    registration category like FINRA does. This means that registrants passing the Series 65 exam
                                    can go to the Administrator’s office with a completed Form ADV and, in most states, a check
                                    for $200 and become a registered investment adviser. Because there is no way for NASAA
                                    to know if you will be opening your own IA firm or simply working as an IAR, some of the
                                    information tested goes into detail that one would expect to be limited to the owners of the
                                    firm. This lesson is an example of that.


                                    LO 14.m Recall what constitutes an adequate business continuity

                                    In April 2015, NASAA released a Model Rule dealing with business continuity plans for
                                    state-registered investment advisers. In most respects, it mirrors FINRA Rule 4370 dealing with
                                    their member broker-dealers. The rule requires that every investment adviser shall establish,
                                    implement, and maintain written procedures relating to a Business Continuity and Succession
                                    Plan (BCP). The plan should be based upon the facts and circumstances of the investment
                                    adviser’s business model, including the size of the firm, the type(s) of services provided, and the
                                    number of locations of the investment adviser. The plan shall provide for at least the following:
                                     The protection, backup, and recovery of books and records
                                     Alternate means of communication with customers, key personnel, employees, vendors,
                                       service providers (including third-party custodians), and regulators, including, but
                                       not limited to, providing notice of a significant business interruption or the death or
                                       unavailability of key personnel or other disruptions or cessation of business activities
                                     Office relocation in the event of temporary or permanent loss of a principal place of
                                       business
                                     Assignment of duties to qualified responsible persons in the event of the death or
                                       unavailability of key personnel

                                    Purpose of a Business Continuity Plan
                                    The most common purpose of a BCP is to have processes and procedures in place to ensure
                                    that critical business functions can continue during and after a disaster or other significant
                                    business interruption. BCPs outline actions advisers should take if utility outages, catastrophic
                                    natural disasters, national emergencies, acts of terrorism, or other types of disturbances disrupt
                                    day-to-day business operations. Advisers’ BCPs should reflect comprehensive approaches to
                                    reduce and manage risks associated with disasters, significant business interruptions, and
                                    work stoppages. All BCPs should include Succession Plans. Advisers have a fiduciary duty to
                                    act in the best interest of their clients, and it is in the best interest of clients for advisers to
                                    adopt a Succession Plan with procedures to ensure continuity of services and the day-to-day
                                    operations of the business, or to smoothly wind down advisers’ businesses in the event of
                                    death, disability, or incapacity. Without proper planning, the unexpected loss of executives,
                                    key personnel, or owners can be disastrous to the business and to clients.

                                        Succession Issues
                                        Planning for an unexpected succession situation is an important part of a BCP. While there
                                        are some succession issues that apply to every adviser (e.g., every adviser needs a designated
                                        regulatory contact person), each adviser must also tailor its Succession Plan to the adviser’s
                                        needs. An adviser’s business entity structure will affect the types of items that should be
                                        addressed in the adviser’s Succession Plan.

                                        For example, in a sole proprietorship, the client’s legal relationship is with the sole proprietor,
                                        who is often the only investment adviser representative. With the death or permanent
                                        disability of the owner, the sole proprietorship itself may legally terminate as an entity, as
                                        would any powers of attorney, advisory contracts, and other client agreements. The deceased
                                        (or otherwise incapacitated) sole proprietor is likely to be the only regulatory contact and
                                        may be the only person who would be able to access electronic client files or authorize
                                        rebates of prepaid fees. There are many additional issues, such as probate, that are unique
                                        to sole proprietorships and affect the implementation of a Succession Plan. Therefore, the
                                        adviser should have a Succession Plan that will immediately address these issues when an IAR
                                        becomes unavailable. Regardless of who takes over, a person cannot provide advisory services
                                        for compensation unless she is registered with the state’s securities regulator(s) or exempt from
                                        registration.

                                        Advisers should consider the following items when drafting a Succession Plan to ensure that
                                        the Succession Plan adequately accounts for the risks related to the business entity.
                                         Are the clients’ investment advisory contracts with an individual or a legal entity?
                                         Does an IAR’s death or unavailability affect the advisory agreement?

                                    1.   The first step in developing a Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is to identify the risks
                                         that could cause a service interruption. Such risks would include:
                                           A. a natural disaster (such as storms, earthquakes, or flooding).
                                          B. the death or disability of a key employee.
                                          C. a service provider interruption (such as the internet going down).

                                    2.   The death of an investment adviser’s key person would most likely have the
                                         greatest immediate effect when the firm is organized as

                                          B. an LLC.

             INTRODUCTION
                                    Taxes on income and capital gains diminish the amount of money available to the person who
                                    earns it. As a result, personal and business investment decisions are often influenced by the tax
                                    implications.


             LESSON 15.1: INDIVIDUAL TAXATION

                                    LO 15.a Recognize income tax fundamentals for individuals.

                                    Taxes function as either regressive or progressive. Regressive taxes (e.g., sales, excise, payroll,
                                    property, and gasoline taxes) are levied at the same rate regardless of income and thus represent
                                    a smaller percentage of income for wealthy taxpayers than for taxpayers with lower incomes.
                                    Because low-income families spend a larger percentage of their incomes than they save or
                                    invest, regressive taxes consume a larger fraction of the income of the poor than of the wealthy.
                                    Progressive taxes (e.g., estate, gift, and income taxes) increase the tax rate as income increases.
                                    Progressive taxes are costlier to people with high incomes than to people with low incomes.
                                    This unit will deal with taxation on the federal level with specific reference to state taxes when
                                    necessary.

                                                     TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                     In a progressive tax system, the term used to describe the highest rate paid on income
                                                     (sometimes referred to as the next dollar received, or the last dollar received) is the
                                                     individual’s marginal tax rate. For example, in 2021, a single individual with taxable
                                                     income in excess of $209,425 was taxed on each dollar earned above that amount
                                                     at a rate of 35% until reaching $523,601, at which time the excess is taxed at 37%.
                                                     Therefore, if this individual reported earnings of $250,000, it is proper to say that the
                                                     marginal tax rate is 35%. If the individual earned $550,000, then it would be 37%.

                                        Please note that the actual tax brackets are never tested on the exam because they change every
                                        year—we are showing them only as examples. The only tax-related numbers that might appear
                                        on the exam are the annual IRA maximum and the annual gift exclusion.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     Based on the above information, a single taxpayer with taxable income of $220,000
                                                     is given a $10,000 bonus. The federal income tax on that bonus is taxed at the
                                                     individual’s marginal (or top) tax bracket rate of 35%, so the tax would be $3,500. This
                                                     individual won’t move into another bracket until taxable income exceeds $523,601.

                                        Besides the amount of income, the most important factor in determining an individual’s
                                        income tax bill is the choice of filing status.

                                        The choice of filing status one makes has a major impact on the amount of taxes levied. There
                                        are five different filing statuses:
                                         Single
                                         Married filing jointly
                                         Married filing separately
                                         Head of household
                                         Qualifying widow(er) with dependent child
                                        Filing status is determined by your marital status as of the last day of the year. If more than
                                        one filing status applies to the taxpayer, the IRS suggests using the one resulting in the lowest
                                        tax obligation. Generally, that will be married filing jointly. For those who are not married, if
                                        qualifying, the lowest rate is usually obtained by filing as head of household.

                                                     TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                     How you file a return can impact your taxes. Your tax-filing status is based on your
                                                     marital status as of the end of the year (December 31). In the case of a “single” parent
                                                     with dependent children, it will generally be most advantageous to use the filing status
                                                     “head of household.”

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     In most cases, the tax-filing status that results in the highest income tax is

                                                     B. married filing jointly.

                                               Answer: D. In general, for the same amount of income, filing single will result in the
                                               highest income tax while married filing jointly, the lowest. Head of household is usually
                                               the best for those who are not married but do have children.
                                    Other factors include:

                                    Age: Taxpayers who are 65 or older receive an addition of $1,300 each if married and filing
                                    a joint return, or $1,600 if single, to the standard deduction. This additional amount is also
                                    available to those who are blind or disabled. This increased standard deduction can lower the
                                    tax bill.

                                    State of residence: If the taxpayer lives in a state with a state income tax, up to certain limits,
                                    the amount paid can be taken as a deduction on the federal return, thus lowering the tax due.

                                    Citizenship: An individual who is not a citizen of the U.S. may pay taxes at a different rate
                                    than citizens and may also receive certain tax credits due to tax treaties. Much of this depends
                                    on whether the individual is a resident alien or a nonresident alien, and the details are beyond

                                                    Under current tax law, which of the following would not be a factor in determining an
                                                    individual’s federal income liability?

                                                    Answer: D. One area in which the federal tax laws do not discriminate is the
                                                    individual’s sex. Those 65 and older are entitled to an additional exemption;
                                                    non-U.S. citizens may pay more or less tax based on tax treaties and other factors;
                                                    and filing status has a major impact on taxes.

          LESSON 15.2: TAXATION OF INCOME VERSUS THE SALE OF CAPITAL ASSETS
                                        LO 15.b Identify the different sources of income and loss.


                                        Types of Income and Losses
                                        Individuals can receive income from a number of sources. Let’s discuss the most important
                                        ones for the exam.


                                        Earned Income
                                        Earned income includes salary, bonuses, tips, and income derived from active participation in
                                        a trade or business.


                                        Alimony
                                        Alimony is payment made under a (divorce) court order (or under a legal separation
                                        agreement) to an ex-spouse. Alimony may be paid directly to the ex-spouse or to a third
                                        party on the ex-spouse’s behalf (e.g., to pay premiums on the ex-spouse’s life insurance or
                                        contribute to the ex-spouse’s IRA). Alimony payments, within limits, are generally deductible
                                        to the spouse making the payments and includable in income for tax purposes by the spouse
                                        receiving them.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     Effective January 1, 2019, the tax treatment of alimony was reversed. That is, the
                                                     former spouse paying the alimony won’t get to deduct the payment and the former
                                                     spouse receiving the alimony won’t report it as income. That change means that
                                                     anyone receiving alimony from a divorce decree entered into after December 31, 2018,
                                                     cannot declare that as income for IRA purposes. It does not affect earlier divorces.


                                        Child Support
                                        Alimony should not be confused with child support. Child support is a legal obligation of a
                                        parent to provide financial support for a child (typically occurring when the parent providing
                                        the support is not the parent with whom the child or children live). Child support is not
                                        deductible by the parent who pays it, nor is it includable in income by the recipient, who is
                                        often the other parent receiving the support on behalf of the child of the dissolved marriage.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     Chuck and Alice divorced on November 2, 2018, after a 10-year marriage that produced
                                                     two children—Tim, age 6, and Kim, age 8. Under a court order, it is decided that Chuck
                                                     will pay Alice $1,000 per month in alimony and $600 per child per month ($1,200 in
                                                     total child support). Chuck may deduct $12,000 of alimony payments for the tax year
                                                     ($1,000 × 12 months) on his federal income tax return. Alice must report $12,000 of
                                                     alimony payments for the tax year on her federal income tax return. Chuck cannot
                                                     deduct any of the $14,400 in child support, nor is any of it reportable for income tax by
                                                     Alice or their children.

                                                                                                       Unit 15   Tax Considerations     355


                                               Had the divorce taken place two months later (in 2019), then Chuck would not have
                                               been able to deduct the alimony and Alice would not report it as income. That means
                                               the alimony would not count as earned income for IRA purposes.

                                               TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                               For purposes of an IRA contribution, alimony from pre-2019 is considered eligible
                                               income while alimony from a divorce after 2018 is not. Child support is never eligible
                                               income.


                                    Passive Income and Passive Losses
                                    Passive income and passive losses come from rental property, limited partnerships, and
                                    enterprises (regardless of business structure) in which an individual does not actively
                                    participate. For the general partner, income from a limited partnership is earned income; for
                                    the limited partner, the income is passive, not earned. Passive income is netted against passive
                                    losses to determine net taxable income, which is then taxed at ordinary income rates. Passive
                                    losses may be used to offset only passive income.

                                    Do not confuse passive losses, which are investment related, with casualty losses, which are
                                    not. You may be able to deduct losses based on the damage done to your property during
                                    a disaster. A casualty is a sudden, unexpected, or unusual event. This may include natural
                                    disasters like hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and earthquakes. It can also include losses from
                                    fires, accidents, thefts, or vandalism. But, because these losses are not investment related, the
                                    exam should not get into any detail as to how much can be deducted from taxable income.


                                    Portfolio Income
                                    Portfolio income includes dividends, interest, and net capital gains derived from the sale
                                    of securities. No matter what the source of the income, it is taxed in the year in which it is
                                    earned. Capital gains and capital losses will be covered separately.


                                    Dividend Income
                                    If the dividend qualifies (you don’t need to know the technical points that make a dividend
                                    qualify), the tax rate is generally a maximum of 15%. (It can be as high as 20% or more
                                    for very high-income taxpayers, but that is unlikely to be tested.) Otherwise, the dividend
                                    is taxed at ordinary income rates. For test purposes, assume that any dividend from a
                                    U.S. corporation, including stock mutual funds, is qualified, unless the question states
                                    otherwise.

                                               PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   An investor who would like to increase current income from investments and, at
                                                   the same time, pay taxes on that income at less than her marginal tax rate would
                                                   probably find which of the following to be most suitable?
                                                    A.   U.S. Treasury bonds
                                                    B.   Public utility stock                                                                  Unit 15

                                                         Answer: B. The key to this question is that dividends paid on stock issued by
                                                         American companies (and certain qualified foreign corporations) generally qualify for
                                                         a reduced tax rate (maximum 15 to 20%). No such benefit accrues to money market
                                                         funds (their dividends are generated from interest income), and government bond
                                                         interest is always taxed as ordinary income (although state income tax free). The
                                                         dividends on a growth stock would also qualify, but, because the question deals
                                                         with increasing current income, public utility is a more sensible approach. This is an
                                                         example of how the test might present you with two answer choices that could be
                                                         correct, and you must choose the one that is more correct.


                                        Interest Income
                                        Interest on any debt security (other than tax-free municipal issues) is always taxed at ordinary
                                        income rates. Please note that interest on U.S. Treasury securities (but not GMNA and
                                        FNMA debt) is exempt from state and local taxation, but not federal. Furthermore, income
                                        distributions from bond funds are not qualified dividends and are taxed fully as ordinary
                                        income.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     Although interest income from municipal bonds is tax free, capital gains are fully
                                                     taxable. Capital gains occur when the bond is sold for a price that is greater than
                                                     the investor’s cost basis (investment) in the bond. This is also true of capital gains
                                                     distributions from municipal bond mutual funds. While the income distributions may
                                                     be tax free, capital gains from any source are always taxable.

                                                     TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                     In the case of TIPS, the taxation is a bit different. Being Treasury securities, they
                                                     are exempt from state and local income tax. However, the annual interest payment
                                                     received is taxable on a federal basis as ordinary income and, what is reminiscent of
                                                     the tax treatment of a zero coupon bond discussed in Unit 2, the annual increase to
                                                     the principal is taxed as well.

                                        What about income from foreign issuers? Dividend and interest income received from foreign
                                        securities, including ADRs, is normally subject to withholding tax, typically about 15%, by
                                        the issuer’s country of domicile. Current U.S. tax law allows many investors to reclaim the
                                        withheld tax as a credit against taxes owed on their tax returns, and it is not a preference item
                                        for AMT (LO 15.d). For example, if you purchased some Matilda (also called kangaroo)
                                        bonds (remember them from Unit 2: they are issued in the Australian marketplace by
                                        non-Australian entities), the Australian government requires that a withholding tax be placed
                                        on the interest, but U.S. taxpayers can take that tax withheld as a credit against U.S. income
                                        tax due on the interest. In almost all cases, income from foreign securities is taxed in the
                                        U.S. at all levels (federal and state).


                                        Taxation of Reinvested Distributions
                                        Distributions are taxable to shareholders whether the distributions are taken in cash or
                                        reinvested. The issuer must disclose whether each distribution comes from income or realized
                                        capital gains. Form 1099, which is sent to shareholders after the close of the year, details tax
                                        information related to distributions for the year. Dividends must be reported as dividend
                                        income and will be taxed either as ordinary income or as a qualifying dividend, generally with

                                    a maximum rate of 15%; capital gains distributions from mutual funds are generally reported
                                    as a long-term capital gain. Reinvesting distributions has a compounding effect.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              One term you might see on the exam refers to an interest-on-interest plan, and it will
                                              be compared to a dividend reinvestment plan. What is the exam referring to? This is
                                              nothing other than a typical bank savings account where your interest compounds,
                                              usually quarterly. Therefore, you are earning interest on the interest. From a tax
                                              standpoint, this interest, just like reinvested dividends, is taxable in the year received.


                                    Dividend Reinvestment Plans
                                    Some corporations offer their shareholders the opportunity to purchase additional shares of
                                    the company’s common stock using their cash dividend. Under most dividend reinvestment
                                    plans (DRIPs), the shareholder automatically purchases the additional shares directly from
                                    the issuer, paying little or no commission and often at a discount to market price. In fact,
                                    most companies permit investors in these plans to add money along with the reinvested
                                    dividend. As was covered above, reinvesting dividends does not mean they are not currently
                                    taxed. However, the amount of reinvested dividends increases the investor’s cost basis, thereby
                                    reducing the amount of capital gains if the position is later sold at a profit.


                                    The Effect of Reinvestments on Cost Basis
                                    Because the taxes have already been paid on any income reinvested, when the investor sells the
                                    asset, the cost basis is increased so that the income is not taxed again.

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              An investor purchases 100 shares of KAPCO common stock for $100 per share and
                                              elects to participate in KAPCO’s Dividend Reinvestment Plan (DRIP). During the next
                                              five years, the investor receives dividends totaling $2,200, which has allowed the
                                              purchase of 20 additional shares through the DRIP. With KAPCO selling at $110 per
                                              share, the investor liquidates the entire position. For tax purposes, the investor has
                                              a capital gain of $1,000, even though the proceeds are $3,200 more than the original
                                              investment. Here’s the math:
                                              Purchase – 100 shares @ $100 = $10,000. Add the reinvested dividends of $2,200 to
                                              increase the cost basis to $12,200. Sell all the shares (100 + the 20 acquired through
                                              the DRIP) = 120 × $110 = $13,200. The proceeds exceed the adjusted cost basis by
                                              $1,000, and that is the amount of the capital gain.

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  An investor purchases 100 shares of DERP common stock @ $50 per share and
                                                  elects to have all cash dividends reinvested through the DRIP being offered by DERP.
                                                  After holding the stock for five years, the investor has reinvested $1,200 and acquired
                                                  20 additional shares. If the market price of DERP is $55 per share and the investor

                                                                                                                                                   Unit 15

                                                         Answer: B. The investor establishes the position at a cost of $5,000. To that, we add
                                                         the $1,200 cost of the reinvested dividends, bringing the investor’s tax cost basis to
                                                         $6,200. When all of the shares are sold, the proceeds are $6,600 (120 shares x $55).
                                                         Subtracting the $6,200 cost from the $6,600 proceeds results in a capital gain of $400.


                                                     TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                     Regardless of fluctuations in the market price, as long as a dividend is paid, investors
                                                     participating in a DRIP will always have more shares in their account at the end of the
                                                     year than at the beginning.


                                        Retirement Plan Distributions
                                        Qualified retirement plan distributions are, with few exceptions, taxed at the investor’s
                                        ordinary income tax rate when funds are withdrawn from the plan. Distributions from a
                                        qualified plan before the investor reaches age 59½ are also subject to a 10% early withdrawal
                                        penalty. Distributions from a qualified plan must begin by April 1 following the year the
                                        participant reaches age 72 (more on this in Unit 18).


                                        Margin Expenses
                                        Margin interest is a tax-deductible expense (margin accounts are covered in Unit 23). The
                                        one exception is interest expenses incurred in the purchase of municipal securities. Because
                                        municipal interest income is federally tax exempt, the IRS does not allow taxpayers to
                                        deduct the margin interest expenses for municipal securities. Investors can deduct interest
                                        expenses incurred when borrowing money to purchase other securities to the extent those
                                        interest expenses do not exceed their net investment income, which includes interest income,
                                        dividends, and all capital gains.


                                        Effective Tax Rate
                                        In an earlier Test Topic Alert, we introduced you to the term marginal tax rate. That should
                                        not be confused with the individual’s effective tax rate. What is the difference? As stated
                                        earlier, the marginal tax rate is the rate you pay on each additional dollar you receive as
                                        income. The effective tax rate, however, is the overall rate of tax you pay on your total taxable
                                        income. The following example should help you visualize the difference.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     In the Test Topic Alert, we showed you how a single person with $250,000 in taxable
                                                     income was paying taxes at a marginal rate of 35%. That is, a bonus of $10,000 would
                                                     result in an additional tax liability of $3,500. That 35% rate was in effect for all income
                                                     in excess of $200,000. According to the tax tables (and absolutely not tested), the tax
                                                     on that first $209,425 is $47,843, and then everything above that (until $523,601) is
                                                     taxed at 35%. So, for the single individual with $250,000 of taxable income, the total
                                                     tax bill would be $47,843 + (35% × $40,575) or $47,843 + $14,201, which is a total tax
                                                     of $62,044. That means that out of $250,000 in income, slightly less than 25% of it
                                                     ($62,044 divided by $250,000) went to pay tax. This works out to be an effective tax rate
                                                     of 24.82%.

                                    LO 15.c Distinguish between income and capital gains and how they
                                    are taxed.

                                    Whereas income is generally money received from the ownership of an investment
                                    (e.g., dividends on a stock, interest on a debt security, or earnings from personal work, such
                                    as salary), capital gains and losses always involve the sale of an asset. The sale of a security can
                                    result in a capital gain or a capital loss. A capital gain occurs when a security is sold for a
                                    price higher than its cost basis. If the selling price is lower than the cost basis, a capital loss
                                    occurs.


                                    Capital Gains
                                    A capital gain occurs when capital assets (securities, real estate, and tangible property)
                                    are sold at prices that exceed the adjusted cost basis. Usually, computing the capital gain
                                    or loss on an asset is a matter of comparing the purchase price with the selling price less
                                    commissions.

                                               TAKE NOTE
                                               A lower cost basis results in a larger capital gain. The gain is determined by comparing
                                               the sales proceeds with the cost basis.

                                               EXAMPLE
                                               If the investor’s cost basis in stock is $50 per share and shares are sold for $60, the
                                               investor has a capital gain of $10. However, if the investor’s cost basis is $55 and the
                                               shares are sold for $60, the investor’s capital gain is only $5.


                                    Adjusting Cost Basis
                                    An investment’s cost basis (total cost of the investment) is used to determine whether a
                                    capital gain or a capital loss occurs when an asset is sold. Because many factors affect an asset’s
                                    cost basis, the IRS requires the cost basis to be adjusted for such occurrences as stock splits
                                    and stock dividends.

                                               EXAMPLE
                                               A client buys 100 shares of RST at $55. Later, the company declares a stock dividend,
                                               and the investor receives 10 more shares. The client’s total investment remains $5,500,
                                               but there are now 110 shares of RST in the account. The investor’s adjusted cost basis
                                               per share is now $50 ($5,500 ÷ 110). When the securities are sold, the holding period
                                               is based upon the original purchase date; the date(s) of the acquisition of the shares
                                               through the stock dividend(s) or stock split(s) are of no consequence. If the sales price
                                               exceeds the adjusted cost basis, the investor realizes a capital gain; if they are lower, a
                                               capital loss.


                                    Effects of Reinvesting on Cost Basis for Computing Capital Gains/Losses                                        Unit 15
                                    A few pages ago, we discussed the fact that any distributions received, whether taken in
                                    cash or reinvested, were reported on Form 1099 as taxable for that year. In the case of
                                    reinvestments, because they have already been taxed, when a sale takes place, they are not
                                    taxed again—the amount reinvested adds to the investor’s tax basis (or cost).

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     An investor purchases 100 shares of XYZ common stock for $100 per share. Total cost
                                                     is $10,000. After enrolling in the DRIP offered by XYZ, the investor receives dividends
                                                     for three years in the total amount of $1,200. Let’s say that these reinvested dividends
                                                     have purchased 10 shares. The investor now sells all of the XYZ for $125 per share. For
                                                     tax purposes, there is a capital gain of $2,550. This is computed by subtracting the cost
                                                     ($10,000 + $1,200 = $11,200) from the proceeds (110 shares × $125 = $13,750).


                                        Capital Losses
                                        A capital loss occurs when capital assets are sold at prices that are lower than the adjusted cost
                                        basis.


                                        Net Capital Gains and Losses
                                        To calculate tax liability, a taxpayer must first add all short-term capital gains and losses
                                        for the year. (Short-term gains are investments held 12 months or less and are taxed at the
                                        investor’s ordinary income tax rate.) Then all long-term capital gains and losses are added.
                                        (A long-term capital gain or loss only occurs after the investor has held the investment at
                                        risk for a period exceeding one day plus 12 months.) Finally, the taxpayer offsets the totals
                                        to determine the net capital gain or loss for the year. If the result is a net long-term capital
                                        gain, it is taxed at the capital gains rate, currently at 15% for most taxpayers. If the net is a
                                        short-term gain, it is added to the taxpayer’s ordinary income.

                                        Capital losses that exceed capital gains are deductible against taxable income up to a
                                        maximum of $3,000 per year. Any capital losses not deducted in a taxable year may be carried
                                        forward indefinitely as a deduction to offset capital gains in future years. When you carry
                                        over a loss, it remains long term or short term. A long-term capital loss that you carry over
                                        to the next tax year will reduce that year’s long-term capital gains before it reduces that year’s
                                        short-term capital gains. When you figure your capital loss carryover, use your short-term
                                        capital losses first. If you have not reached the $3,000 limit on the capital loss deduction
                                        against income after using the short-term capital losses, use the long-term capital losses until
                                        you reach the limit.


                                        Determining Which Shares to Sell
                                        An investor holding identical securities, each with a different acquisition date and cost basis,
                                        may determine which shares to sell by electing one of three accounting methods: first in, first
                                        out (FIFO); share identification; or average cost basis. If the investor fails to choose, the IRS
                                        assumes the investor liquidates shares on a FIFO basis.

                                        When FIFO shares are sold, the cost of the shares held the longest is used to calculate the gain
                                        or loss. In a rising market, this method normally creates adverse tax consequences.

                                        When using the share identification accounting method, the investor keeps track of the cost
                                        of each share purchased and uses this information to liquidate the shares that would provide
                                        the lowest capital gain. Share identification is used to identify the specific per-share cost basis
                                        when shares are sold. The investor keeps track of the cost of each share purchased and specifies
                                        which shares to sell on the basis of that investor’s specific tax needs.

                                                                                                         Unit 15   Tax Considerations     361


                                    A shareholder may elect to use an average cost basis when redeeming mutual fund shares (but
                                    not shares of specific stocks). The investor would calculate average basis by dividing the total
                                    cost of all shares owned by the total number of shares. The shareholder may not change the
                                    decision to use the average basis method without IRS permission.

                                               TAKE NOTE
                                               Share identification may result in more advantageous tax treatment, but most
                                               accountants prefer the convenience of the averaging method for mutual fund shares.
                                               Share identification is most commonly used with stock sales.


                                    Wash Sale
                                    An investor may not use capital losses to offset gains or income if the taxpayer sells a security
                                    at a loss and purchases the same or a substantially identical security within 30 days before
                                    or after the trade date establishing the loss. The sale at a loss and the repurchase within this
                                    period is a wash sale. The loss that was disallowed, however, is added to the repurchased
                                    shares’ cost basis.

                                               EXAMPLE
                                               An investor buys 100 shares of ABC for $50 per share. One year later, the investor
                                               sells those shares for $40 per share. Fifteen days after the sale, 100 shares of ABC are
                                               repurchased for $42 per share. The investor’s new cost basis is $52 because the $10
                                               loss that was disallowed is added to the repurchase price of $42.

                                    Substantially identical securities include stock rights, call options, warrants, and convertible
                                    securities of the same issue.

                                    The IRS compares three qualities of debt securities in determining whether they are
                                    substantially identical: the maturity, coupon, and issuer. A bond is substantially identical if all
                                    three qualities of the bond sold at a loss and the newly purchased bond are the same.

                                    After selling a bond, an investor can buy another bond with a different maturity, coupon, or
                                    issuer without violating the wash sale rule.

                                               EXAMPLE
                                               An investor could sell an ABC 8% bond that matures in 2030 at a loss and buy back
                                               an XYZ 8% bond that matures in 2031 and claim the loss. This is commonly called
                                               tax-swapping.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     The wash sale rule applies only to realized losses—not to realized gains.


                                        Sale of a Primary Residence
                                        The final example of capital gains taxation deals with the unique treatment offered on the sale
                                        of a primary residence. There are special tax benefits available to those selling their primary
                                        residence as long as it has been lived in as the primary residence for at least two of the past five
                                        years. For a couple, the first $500,000 in profit is excluded from capital gains taxation; for a
                                        single person, it is the first $250,000.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     Chloe and Edgar bought their home 30 years ago for $50,000. Now that the children
                                                     are all on their own, they decide to downsize and move to a retirement village. If they
                                                     sell their home for $600,000, what is the tax consequence?
                                                     Chloe and Edgar are selling their home for a profit of $550,000. However, the first
                                                     $500,000 for a couple is excluded from taxation. Therefore, they will only have to
                                                     report the remaining $50,000 as a long-term capital gain.



                                        LO 15.d Recall the preference items included in the AMT computation.


                                        Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)
                                        Congress enacted the alternative minimum tax (AMT) to ensure that high-income taxpayers
                                        do not escape federal income taxes. Certain items that receive favorable tax treatment must be
                                        added back into taxable income for the AMT and include the following:

                                         Certain costs associated with limited partnership programs, such as research and
                                           development costs and excess intangible drilling costs
                                         Local tax and interest on investments that do not generate income
                                         Tax-exempt interest on private purpose municipal bonds issued after August 7, 1986.
                                           Examples of these private purpose or private activity bonds subject to the AMT would be
                                           those issued to finance sports stadiums, hospitals, housing projects, and so forth.
                                         Incentive stock options (ISOs), to the extent that the fair market value of the employer’s
                                           stock is in excess of the strike price of the option, even when the stock is not sold in
                                           that year

                                        To determine if you owe AMT, you compute your regular tax and then you compute the
                                        AMT and pay whichever is the higher amount. The IRS has an unusual way of stating this.
                                        They say that the AMT is the regular tax plus the amount by which the AMT exceeds the
                                        regular tax. So, if the AMT computation shows $12,000 due and the regular shows $10,000
                                        due, you take that $10,000 and add the amount by which $12,000 exceeds $10,000 ($2,000)
                                        to arrive at $12,000. Wouldn’t saying “Pay the higher of the two” be easier? It sure would,
                                        but then that might put some accountants out of business, just like simplifying the tax code
                                        would do.

                                    TAKE NOTE
                                    Items that must be added back in for the purpose of the AMT computation are
                                    sometimes called tax preference items. If the tax liability computed under the AMT
                                    computation is greater than the taxpayer’s regular tax computation, the taxpayer must
                                    pay the AMT amount.

                                    1.   Your customer in the 24% federal income tax bracket would probably pay the
                                         most tax on a $5,000 investment into
                                          A. dividends received on domestic common stock.
                                          B. dividends received on domestic preferred stock.
                                          C. interest received on U.S. Treasury bonds.
                                          D. interest received on municipal bonds.
                                    2.   A taxpayer has realized short-term capital gains of $50,000 and long-term capital
                                         gains of $75,000 during the taxable year. Over the same period, the individual
                                         realized short-term capital losses of $40,000 and long-term capital losses of
                                         $100,000. The tax consequences of these transactions are
                                           A. a net short-term capital gain of $10,000 and a net long-term capital loss of
                                               $25,000.
                                           B. a net long-term capital loss of $15,000 and no gain carryover.
                                           C. a $3,000 deduction from income and a long-term capital loss carryover of

                                    3.   Which of the following is considered a tax preference item for the purposes of
                                         calculating the alternative minimum tax?
                                          A. Incentive stock options (ISOs) to the extent that the fair market value of the
                                              employer’s stock is in excess of the strike price of the option
                                          B. Depreciation on property placed in service after 1986
                                          C. Intangible drilling costs to a limited partnership program

             INTRODUCTION
                                    When an individual account is opened, it is registered in the name(s) of one or more
                                    individuals; they are the account owners and the only individuals allowed access to and control
                                    of the investments in the account. Generally, any competent person of majority age can open an
                                    account, and anyone declared legally incompetent cannot. Fiduciary or custodial accounts may
                                    be opened for minors or legally incompetent individuals.

                                    In addition to individuals, accounts may be opened for anyone else meeting the definition
                                    of a person. That would include business and government entities. Some of these would be
                                    considered institutional accounts as defined in Unit 9.

                                    Please note that some of the learning objectives (LOs) involve taxation. For the most part, the
                                    numbers used were those in effect in 2021. As pointed out several times, you will never be tested
                                    on the exact numbers (because they change every year) but you will need to know the concepts.

          LESSON 16.1: WHO ARE CLIENTS?
                                        LO 16.a Recognize the different types of clients securities
                                        professionals serve, the different ownership categories, and the legal
                                        documentation required to open these accounts.

                                        Securities professionals can serve a wide variety of clients. They range from the individual
                                        client to sovereign governments and everything in between. In this unit we’ll cover accounts
                                        for natural persons, such as the various types of joint accounts. Accounts can be opened for
                                        all kinds of philanthropic endeavors, including charities and foundations. We’ll also spend
                                        time describing the various types of business accounts. Even though any type of government
                                        unit from municipalities to states to countries can employ the services of broker-dealers
                                        and investment advisers, the exam does not deal with those relationships other than when a
                                        broker-dealer acts as an underwriter for, or an investment adviser gives advice to, a political
                                        issuer.


                                        Types of Accounts
                                        Individual Accounts
                                        An individual account may be for a natural person, a trust, or a deceased person through an
                                        estate account. There is one beneficial owner. When referring to investment advisers, normally
                                        an individual client is a natural person whose investments are managed by an adviser for a fee.
                                        When a business is organized as a sole proprietorship, that business account is also considered
                                        an individual account. The adviser should establish, in consultation with the client, a written
                                        statement of objectives and investment strategy before making recommendations to the client.
                                        This document is frequently referred to as an Investment Policy Statement (IPS). In the next
                                        unit we will examine the client profile and see the information necessary to prepare the IPS.
                                        In Unit 18, we will discuss the use of the IPS by those with fiduciary responsibility over
                                        qualified retirement plans.

                                        The adviser must periodically review the client’s investment profile to determine whether any
                                        changes in circumstances could alter the client’s objectives.

                                        Unless certain legal documents are procured, the account holder is the only person who can:
                                         control the investments within the account; or
                                         request distributions of cash or securities from the account.


                                        Suitability for Individual Accounts
                                        Both federal and state regulations require that any investment recommendation be suitable
                                        based upon the client’s needs, objectives, and financial considerations. In the next unit, we
                                        will look at a number of those issues.

                                    Joint Accounts
                                    A joint account is owned by two or more persons, and each is allowed control over the
                                    account. Generally, suitability information is required on all of the tenants in the account. For
                                    exam purposes, there are only two common types of joint accounts offered by securities firms
                                                                                                                                               Unit 16
                                    and a third for real estate that we’ll cover after those two.

                                    On the new account form, the account must be designated as either tenants in common
                                    (TIC) or joint tenants with right of survivorship (JTWROS). Account forms for joint
                                    accounts require the signatures of all owners. Trading activity (buying or selling) may be
                                    initiated at the request of any one of the parties. If a security is purchased, and a certificate
                                    is issued, it must be in the name of all of the tenants. Furthermore, when that security is
                                    sold, all of the tenants must sign that certificate (or a stock or bond power). The check for
                                    the proceeds must be made payable to all of the tenants, and it will be sent to the address
                                    designated in the account documents.


                                    Joint Tenants with Right of Survivorship (JTWROS)
                                    JTWROS ownership stipulates that a deceased tenant’s interest in the account passes to
                                    the surviving tenant(s). Regardless of contributions, each JTWROS account owner has an
                                    equal and undivided interest in the cash and securities in the account. Upon the death or
                                    declaration of incompetency of any of the account owners, account ownership passes to the
                                    survivor(s); a right of succession occurs, and the other party or parties become sole owner(s)
                                    of the account.

                                               TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                               Whenever the test uses the term joint tenants, it means JTWROS (not tenants in
                                               common).


                                    Tenants in Common (TIC)
                                    TIC ownership (or JTIC) provides that a deceased tenant’s fractional interest in the account
                                    is retained by that tenant’s estate and is not passed to the surviving tenant(s). Ownership of
                                    a TIC account may be divided unequally. At the death of an account owner, that person’s
                                    proportionate share of the cash and securities in the account is distributed according to the
                                    instructions in the decedent’s will. If one account owner dies or is declared incompetent, all
                                    pending transactions and outstanding orders must be canceled immediately.

                                               EXAMPLE
                                               If a TIC agreement provides for 60% ownership interest by one owner and 40%
                                               ownership interest by the other, that fraction of the account would pass into the
                                               deceased owner’s estate upon death. The TIC agreement may be used by more than
                                               two individuals.

                                        Tenancy by the Entirety (TBE)
                                        This is a third type of concurrent ownership, or ownership by multiple persons. As with the
                                        other two we’ve described, each cotenant has an undivided interest in the account. Unlike the
                                        other two we’ve discussed, a tenancy by the entirety can be created only by married persons.
                                        The most important difference between a tenancy by the entirety and a JTWROS or TIC is
                                        that in this form of ownership, the consent of the other tenant is required before the other
                                        tenant can sell or give away her interest in the property. As with JTWROS, upon the death of
                                        one of the spouses, the deceased spouse’s interest passes to the surviving spouse. Because this
                                        form of ownership is restricted to spouses, it is considered similar to the community property
                                        laws found in some states. Tenancy by the entirety is most commonly used for ownership of
                                        real property (real estate) and almost never for an account at a securities firm.

                                        Definition: undivided interest. In a joint account, all owners have an undivided interest
                                        in the account. What does that mean, especially when we see that a TIC can have unequal
                                        shares? Simply stated, an undivided interest means that no tenant has a designated interest
                                        in any specific asset in the account. Even when the shares are unequal, one tenant doesn’t get
                                        stock A and the other stock B. Using our 60/40 example with the TIC account, one owner
                                        would have 60% of each of the holdings and the other 40% of each—the assets themselves are
                                        not divided between the owners.

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    Tenants in common can own unequal interests in the account, unlike joint
                                                      tenants with right of survivorship, who always share equally.
                                                    Tenants by the entirety are considered a single owner—no separate shares.
                                                    TIC does not avoid probate.
                                                    Checks or distributions must be made payable in the account name and endorsed
                                                      by all parties.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                       A new account is opened for joint tenants with right of survivorship. All of the
                                                       following statements are true except
                                                         A. orders may be given by either party.
                                                         B. mail can be sent to either party with the permission of the other party.
                                                         C. checks can be drawn in the name of either party.
                                                         D. in the event of death, the decedent’s interest in the account goes to the other
                                                             party.
                                                       Answer: A. Although either party may enter an order, any money or securities
                                                       delivered out of the account must be in the names of both owners. Right of
                                                       survivorship means that the surviving owner (or owners) receives the deceased’s
                                                       interest in the account.


                                        Suitability for Joint Accounts
                                        The suitability requirements for a joint account follow the same basic rules as all accounts—
                                        you must have a reasonable basis to believe all recommendations presented are suitable based
                                        on the information gathered. Because a joint account is really nothing other than a collection
                                        of individuals, suitability information must be obtained on all of the account owners, and any
                                        recommendations must be appropriate based upon that information. An example you might
                                        see on the exam has two brothers with a TIC account. One brother is an accredited investor

                                    under Rule 501 of the Securities Act, while the other is far from it. In this case, suitability is
                                    usually based on the “lowest common denominator” (the nonaccredited brother).

                                               PRACTICE QUESTIONS
                                               1.   Several investors open an account in joint tenancy. For suitability purposes, financial     Unit 16
                                                    information is required on which of the following investors?
                                                      A. The majority of the investors
                                                      B. The largest investor only
                                                      C. Only the one authorized to trade the account
                                                      D. All of the investors
                                                    Answer: D. When a joint account is opened, in order to be able to make suitable
                                                    recommendations, financial information should be obtained on all of the account
                                                    owners.

                                               2.   Which of the following individuals may not open a joint account?
                                                     A. Two spouses
                                                     B. Three sisters
                                                     C. Two friends
                                                     D. A parent and a minor child
                                                    Answer: D. A joint account may be opened by two or more individuals who have
                                                    legal standing. A minor may not be a party in a joint account because minors are not
                                                    legally considered a person (think back to Unit 9). A parent (or any other adult) can be
                                                    custodian for a minor, but that is a single account, not a joint account.


                                    Legal Requirements for Opening Accounts
                                    Opening an account for an individual requires the completion of the new account agreement.
                                    This is basically a contract between the broker-dealer or investment adviser and the customer
                                    explaining the rights and obligations of both and the charges for the services that will be
                                    rendered. Information that must be obtained from the client includes items such as:

                                       and does she have the capacity to enter into the agreement?);
                                     employment information; and
                                     the Customer Identification Program (CIP) notice. In order to help the government fight
                                       the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, broker-dealers and investment
                                       advisers are required by federal law (the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001) to obtain, verify,
                                       and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. Customer
                                       identification requirements apply to all customers opening a new account as those terms
                                       are defined in the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA). That information includes:
                                        –– full name,
                                        –– date of birth,
                                        –– permanent physical address (no mail receiving or incorporation services), and
                                        –– identification number (if a U.S. citizen, this is typically the Social Security number);
                                     citizenship or visa details; and
                                     financial information about the client.
                                    In the case of joint accounts, the information is the same except that details on all of the joint
                                    owners must be furnished. One of the joint owners is designated as the primary contact to
                                    receive statements and other communications.

          370        Unit 16    Types of Clients



                                        We have not heard anything about the exam requiring you to know the account opening
                                        details for business accounts, although there is plenty about those accounts tested that will be
                                        covered shortly.

                                        In Unit 4, we dealt with derivatives, especially options. There are some unique requirements
                                        to open those accounts. NASAA does not have a specific rule dealing with the opening of
                                        options accounts. Therefore, we will refer to the FINRA rules that are used as the guidelines
                                        for most states.

                                        Because trading options (puts and calls) generally involves a higher degree of risk than stocks,
                                        bonds, or mutual funds, a designated supervisory person with knowledge about options must
                                        approve the account opening. In addition, there is a special options disclosure document
                                        (ODD) that must be provided to any prospective options customer.

                                        In approving a customer’s account for options trading, a broker-dealer or agent associated
                                        with the broker-dealer must exercise due diligence to ascertain the essential facts relative to
                                        the customer, his financial situation, and his investment objectives. One question asked on
                                        a new options account form that is not required on a normal brokerage account opening is
                                        investment experience and knowledge (e.g., number of years, size, frequency, and type of
                                        transactions) for options, stocks and bonds, commodities, and other financial instruments.
                                        Based upon such information, the designated supervisory person shall specifically approve or
                                        disapprove in writing the customer’s account for options trading.

                                        The account approval will indicate the:
                                         date the options disclosure document (ODD) is furnished to the customer;
                                         nature and types of transactions for which the account is approved (e.g., buying, covered
                                           writing, uncovered writing, spreading, discretionary transactions);
                                         name of the agent assigned to the account;
                                         name of the supervisor approving the account;
                                         date of approval; and
                                         dates of verification of currency of account information.
                                        Within 15 days after a customer’s account has been approved for options trading, the
                                        broker-dealer must obtain from the customer a written agreement that the customer is aware
                                        of and agrees to be bound by FINRA rules applicable to the trading of option contracts and
                                        that the customer has received a copy of the current ODD. Part of the agreement states that
                                        the customer is also aware of and agrees to be bound by the rules of the Options Clearing
                                        Corporation.

                                        Finally, there are specific requirements for opening a margin account, and those will be
                                        covered in Unit 23.

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   When an agent with a broker-dealer opens a new options account for a client, in
                                                   which order must the following actions take place?
                                                      I. Obtain approval from a qualified supervisor.

                                                                                                                                             Unit 16
                                                     II. Obtain essential facts from the customer.
                                                    III. Obtain a signed options agreement.
                                                    IV. Enter the initial order.
                                                     A. I, II, III, IV
                                                     B. I, II, IV, III
                                                     C. II, I, IV, III
                                                     D. II, I, III, IV
                                                   Answer: C. The steps in opening an options account occur in the following order:
                                                   obtain essential facts about the customer; give the customer an options disclosure
                                                   document; have the manager approve the account; enter the initial order; and have
                                                   the customer sign and return the options agreement within 15 days.


                                              KNOWLEDGE CHECK 16.1
                                              1.   If three individuals have a tenants in common account with a firm and one individual
                                                   dies, then
                                                     A. the account must be liquidated and the proceeds split evenly among the two
                                                          survivors and the decedent’s estate.
                                                     B. the two survivors continue as co-tenants with the decedent’s estate.
                                                     C. trading is discontinued until the executor names a replacement for the
                                                          deceased.
                                                     D. the account is converted to joint with right of survivorship.
                                              2.   The Bank Secrecy Act requires that financial institutions, such as broker-dealers,
                                                   make reasonable efforts to determine the true identity of those who wish to open an
                                                   account. The primary vehicle for this is the customer identification program (CIP).
                                                   Information not required as part of the CIP would be the customer’s
                                                     A. full name.
                                                     B. complete date of birth.
                                                     C. physical address of birth location.
                                                     D. identification number.


             LESSON 16.2: NONNATURAL PERSON ACCOUNTS
                                    LO 16.b Distinguish between the different kinds of business entities
                                    capable of opening accounts.


                                    Sole Proprietorship
                                    This is the simplest form of business organization and is treated like an individual account.
                                    Therefore, the same issues of suitability that apply to individual accounts apply to the
                                    management of sole proprietorship accounts. In a sole proprietorship, all income (or loss) is
                                    that of the individual. In fact, one of the risks of operating in this fashion is that all of the
                                    owner’s assets are liable for the debts of the business—you can lose everything. Obviously, this
                                    is one of the major considerations when opening an account for this form of business.

          372        Unit 16    Types of Clients



                                        Partnership Accounts
                                        General Partnership
                                        A general partnership is an unincorporated association consisting of two or more individuals.
                                        In a general partnership, the partners manage and are responsible for the operation and debts
                                        of the business. Partnerships are easy to form and easy to dissolve, but they are generally not
                                        suited for raising large sums of capital. Partnerships allow the business’s profits and losses
                                        to flow directly through to the investors for tax purposes, thus avoiding double taxation of
                                        profits at the business and individual levels. As is the case with a sole proprietorship, the
                                        partners are personally liable for debts of the business.

                                        Because the income and losses flow through to the individual partners, an investment policy
                                        for a general partnership would have to consider the combined/collective objectives of all of
                                        the partners.


                                        Limited Partnership
                                        In the case of an enterprise organized as a limited partnership, the management (and liability)
                                        is assigned to the general partner(s) while the limited partner(s) are passive and have liability
                                        limited to their investment. This is the typical case with the Direct Participation Programs
                                        (DPPs) discussed in Unit 5. Suitability decisions are similar to a general partnership except
                                        that the limited partners do not have the full liability of the general partner(s).


                                        Corporate Accounts
                                        S Corporation
                                        An S corporation, although taxed like a partnership, offers investors the limited liability
                                        associated with corporations in general. The profits and losses are passed through directly to
                                        the shareholders in proportion to their ownership in the S corporation. One of the limitations
                                        placed on an S corporation is that it may not have more than 100 shareholders, none of
                                        whom may be a nonresident alien, or more than one class of stock (presumably common).
                                        Losses on S corporation stock may be claimed only to the extent of an investor’s basis in the
                                        shares. The basis includes money contributed or lent to the corporation.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   Geraldine invested $25,000 in an S corporation, along with nine other investors
                                                   who invested the same amount. Within a year, the corporation needed additional
                                                   equipment, so Geraldine lent $10,000 to the business from her own funds. Her basis
                                                   is now $35,000. If the corporation experiences a $400,000 loss, Geraldine’s portion is
                                                   $40,000. However, she may deduct only $35,000 of the loss because that is the amount
                                                   of her basis.


                                        C Corporation
                                        A C corporation is a business structure that distinguishes the company as a separate entity
                                        from its owners. If a business expects to need significant capital, this form is almost always
                                        the preferred choice. Unlike the management of a partnership (the general partner[s]), in
                                        most cases, the corporation’s officers and directors are shielded from personal liability for
                                        the corporation’s debts and losses. Shareholders are also shielded from corporate creditors.
                                        That is the limited liability benefit of owning stock. Corporate income tax applies to the
                                        corporation as an entity rather than being passed through to the shareholder. If your client is

                                    a C corporation, you will only look at the corporation’s financial needs and objectives when
                                    determining suitability.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              C corporation earnings are subject to double taxation. Before distribution, the                   Unit 16
                                              earnings are taxable to the corporation and then are taxed again to the shareholder
                                              when paid out as a dividend. Distributions from LLCs and S corporations are taxed
                                              only once because there is no taxation at the business entity level. On the other hand,
                                              as we will learn in later in this unit, C corporations are entitled to exclude 50% of
                                              dividend income received from domestic corporations.


                                    Limited Liability Company (LLC)
                                    Not really a corporation nor a partnership, a limited liability company (LLC) is a business
                                    structure that combines benefits of incorporation (limited liability) with the tax advantages of
                                    a partnership (flow-through of taxable earnings or losses). The LLC owners are members (not
                                    shareholders) and are not personally liable for the debts of the LLC. Don’t be surprised if the
                                    exam uses the term limited liability membership company. That is just another way of saying
                                    LLC. Unlike the S corporation with its limit of 100 shareholders, there is no upper limit on
                                    the number of members in an LLC.

                                              If a sole proprietorship operates under a DBA (Doing Business As) name that might
                                              seem to imply it is a corporation, it does not remove the full liability from the
                                              individual owner.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              Any business organization client where the entity itself has no liability and is not
                                              subject to tax, such as a partnership, an LLC, or an S corporation, requires the adviser
                                              to look through the entity to the owners in order to properly meet the suitability
                                              standards.


                                    Choosing the Right Business Structure
                                    Here are some testable points to consider when a person is considering the most appropriate
                                    business form to use:
                                     The easiest business to set up, especially if you don’t expect much liability, is the sole
                                       proprietorship. However, because the business and the owner are inseparable, there is
                                       unlimited liability and no limits to the amount of the loss (if any) that may be claimed on
                                       the proprietor’s tax return.
                                     Partnerships and LLCs are generally easier to form and dissolve than a C corporation.
                                     Benefits of structuring a business as a general partnership, an LLC, or an S corporation
                                       would include no double taxation as is the case with a C corporation.
                                     However, a company that expects to be very profitable should be a C corporation instead
                                       of a partnership, an LLC, or an S corporation because in those three, all earnings pass to
                                       owners—nothing can be retained.
                                     Only the sole proprietorship and the C corporation are taxed on their income. The sole
                                       proprietorship’s income is on the owner’s personal tax return (Schedule C of Form 1040)
                                       and the corporation’s is on Form 1120.

                                         The only logical choice where a large amount of capital is to be raised is the C
                                           corporation.
                                         The business entities that have limited liability for owners as well as flow-through of
                                           income or loss are the limited partnership, LLC, and S corporation. The C corporation
                                           has limited liability but no flow-through; the sole proprietorship and general partnership
                                           have flow-through but unlimited liability.
                                         Corporations (including LLCs) survive the death of their owners (even if there is only one
                                           shareholder in an S corporation or C corporation or one member of the LLC).
                                         When it comes to transferability of ownership, the corporate form, especially the C
                                           corporation, is the preferred choice (selling shares is usually pretty straightforward).

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTIONS
                                                   1.   Three friends plan to start a new business. It is anticipated it will be several
                                                        years before the business turns a profit. Which of the following types of business
                                                        organization would be best if they wish to limit their liability while at the same time
                                                        being able to receive favorable tax treatment for the expected losses?
                                                         A. C corporation
                                                         B. S corporation
                                                         C. General partnership
                                                         D. Sole proprietorship
                                                        Answer: B. The only way to limit liability is through a corporation (or LLC or limited
                                                        partnership—neither of which is offered here as a choice). The S corporation allows
                                                        for the flow-through of operating losses to the shareholders while the C corporation
                                                        does not.

                                                   2.   Which of the following business structures is most appropriate for retaining money in
                                                        the business?
                                                          A. A C corporation
                                                         B. A sole proprietorship
                                                         C. An LLC
                                                         D. An S corporation
                                                        Answer: A. Only in the case of a C corporation is money retained not subject to tax
                                                        on the personal level. In all of the other choices, any income is passed through to the
                                                        owners, making it inefficient to accumulate funds in the business.

                                                   3.   Felix and Kathleen are two equal partners in a successful business. With surplus
                                                        funds to invest, they contact a financial planner registered as an investment adviser.
                                                        One recommendation the adviser makes is that they restructure the business as a
                                                        limited liability company (LLC). The most likely reason for that is
                                                          A. tax savings.
                                                          B. the ability to raise additional funds without giving up control of the business.
                                                          C. removing the unlimited liability from the two partners.
                                                          D. customers feel more comfortable dealing with an LLC than a partnership.
                                                        Answer: C. One problem with the partnership form of business is that the partners
                                                        have unlimited personal liability. That is not the case with an LLC; liability is limited
                                                        to the invested capital. The tax treatment for an LLC and a partnership are the same,
                                                        so there would be no tax savings. Raising additional funds means bringing in more
                                                        members with the possibility of losing control.

                                                                                                                                             Unit 16
                                    Sole Proprietorships
                                    Sole proprietorships are the simplest business form but offer no liability protection to the
                                    owner. In fact, this is the only form of business where the potential loss is unlimited because
                                    the personal assets of the owner are at risk in addition to any assets owned by the business.
                                    The owner computes the earnings of the business on Schedule C of her Form 1040, so
                                    anything made (or lost) by the business is reflected directly on her tax return—there is no
                                    separate tax return for the business entity.


                                    Partnerships
                                    Partnerships are relatively easy to form and dissolve and come in two types. Both offer
                                    flow-through of income and losses, the difference being in the degree of liability. General
                                    partnerships provide no liability protection to the partners. In other words, if the business
                                    goes under, they, collectively and separately, are liable for any losses. In a limited partnership,
                                    as the name implies, something is limited. In this case, it is the liability. A limited partner’s
                                    maximum loss is what has already been invested plus any funds committed for but not yet
                                    contributed. That is why so many DPPs are organized as LPs.

                                    Partnerships do not pay taxes. They file an information return, a Form 1065, and attach
                                    to that (and send a copy to each limited partner) a Schedule K-1 indicating the amount of
                                    income (or loss) to be inserted on the investor’s personal Form 1040.


                                    Limited Liability Company (LLC)
                                    The LLC is somewhat of a hybrid between the partnership and the corporation. The federal
                                    government does not recognize an LLC as a classification for federal tax purposes. An LLC
                                    business entity must file as a corporation, partnership, or sole proprietorship. Generally, a
                                    one-member LLC will use Schedule C, just as if it were a sole proprietorship. Those with two
                                    or more members invariably file as partnerships using Form 1065 to provide the IRS with
                                    the information and Schedule K-1 for each member’s share of income or loss. If filing as a
                                    corporation, they generally file as an S corporation, but it is unlikely, for test purposes, that
                                    you will have to know anything about an LLC filing as a corporation.


                                    Corporations
                                    As with partnerships, we have two types here as well—the C corporation and the S
                                    corporation. Of all the business entities we’ve discussed, the only one that actually files a tax
                                    return on which it must pay income tax is the C corporation. It files on Form 1120 and pays
                                    taxes at a rate that generally does not exceed 21%. The key fact about the C corporation is
                                    that its dividends are paid out after paying income taxes, and then that dividend is taxable to
                                    the shareholder; hence the term double taxation.

                                    The S corporation (sometimes referred to by its ancient name, Subchapter S corporation, on the
                                    exam) is treated for tax purposes the same as a partnership except that the return filed is Form
                                    1120S. Shareholders receive a Schedule K-1 indicating their share of income or loss. Just as
                                    with the LLC and the partnership, the business entity is not taxed; everything flows through
                                    to the owners. The TCJA (Tax Cuts and Jobs Act) of 2017 made a major change in the way
                                    that flow-through business entities are taxed, but those are unlikely to be tested.

                                        C corporations are major investors in securities. Some Internal Revenue Code (IRC)
                                        provisions affecting C corporations as investors include the following:
                                         Dividend exclusion rule: Dividends paid from one corporation to another are 50%
                                           exempt from taxation. A corporation that receives dividends on stocks of other domestic
                                           (and certain qualifying foreign) corporations, therefore, pays taxes on only 50% of the
                                           dividends received.
                                         Municipal securities: Like individual taxpayers, corporations do not pay federal taxes on
                                           interest received from municipal bonds.


                                        Filing Dates for Business Tax Returns
                                        Sole Proprietorship
                                        A business organized as a sole proprietorship is an extension of the individual running the
                                        business, so its year-end date is December 31, and the tax return due date is the same as the
                                        individual’s—April 15 of the following year.


                                        Single Member LLC
                                        If the business is an LLC with only one member, it is taxed like a sole proprietorship, using
                                        Schedule C with a year-end date of December 31. The tax returns are due and taxes payable
                                        on April 15 of the following year.


                                        Partnership and Multiple Member LLCs
                                        The tax-filing requirements for a partnership and an LLC with more than one member are the
                                        same. An information return is filed on Form 1065, with a Schedule K-1 sent to the partners/
                                        members indicating the amount of income or loss attributable to each of them. Remember,
                                        the business entity pays no income tax—all reportable income/loss flows through to the
                                        partners/members. Form 1065 and the K-1 are due on March 15 of the following year. The
                                        year-end date for these businesses is typically December 31. Because these are flow-through
                                        entities, they don’t pay taxes. Taxes are due on April 15, when the individual partners/
                                        members file their Form 1040s showing their share of the business’s income or loss that was
                                        reported on Schedule K-1.


                                        Corporations
                                        A regular (C) corporation may choose any convenient date as their year-end date (usually a
                                        quarter-end date). C corporation tax returns are due and taxes are payable on the 15th day of
                                        the fourth month after the end of the company’s fiscal (financial) year. So, a C corporation
                                        with a year-end date of December 31 must file and pay taxes by April 15; a C corporation
                                        with a year-end date of September 30 must file and pay taxes by January 15.

                                        In the case of an S corporation, income/loss is taxed on individual income tax returns.
                                        Therefore, an S corporation must usually take a calendar year-end date (December 31) unless
                                        the corporation can establish a reasonable business purpose for a different date. The due date
                                        for filing Form 1120S is the same as for partnerships and multiple member LLCs (March 15
                                        for a December 31 year-end date). As with the other flow-through entities, Schedule K-1 is
                                        sent to shareholders one month before their personal income tax due date and is used in the
                                        preparation of their Form 1040 returns.

                                              You may be asked about tax documents for each of these different forms of business
                                              organizations. Sole proprietors file their business information on Schedule C. Members
                                              of LLCs and shareholders in S corporations receive Schedule K-1, and C corporations

                                                                                                                                                  Unit 16

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   Most new businesses operate at a loss for a period of time. If several of your clients
                                                   were forming a group to fund a start-up enterprise but wished to limit their liability
                                                   and, at the same time, be able to receive favorable tax treatment for the expected
                                                   losses, you would suggest forming which of the following?
                                                     A. C corporation
                                                     B. General partnership
                                                     C. LLC
                                                     D. Sole proprietorship
                                                   Answer: C. The only way to limit liability is through a corporation (C or S), LLC, or
                                                   limited partnership. The LLC allows for the flow-through of operating losses to the
                                                   shareholders while the C corporation does not.

             LESSON 16.3: FIDUCIARY ACCOUNTS AND TRUSTS
                                    LO 16.d Classify the special requirements for fiduciary accounts,
                                    including trust and estate accounts.


                                    Fiduciary Accounts
                                    In a fiduciary account, the individual granted fiduciary responsibility enters trades for the
                                    account; makes all of the investment, management, and distribution decisions; and must
                                    manage the account in the owner’s best interests.

                                    Examples of fiduciaries include the following:
                                     Trustee designated to administer a trust
                                     Executor (f. executrix) designated in a decedent’s will to manage the estate’s affairs
                                     Administrator appointed by the courts to liquidate the estate of a person who died
                                       intestate (without a will), known as an administrator in intestacy

                                         Guardian (conservator) designated by the courts to handle the affairs of a minor or a
                                           person judged incompetent
                                         Custodian of a UGMA account
                                         Receiver or trustee in a bankruptcy
                                        A fiduciary is anyone legally appointed and authorized to represent another person, act on
                                        that person’s behalf, and make decisions necessary to the prudent management of that person’s
                                        account. The constraints placed on the actions of a fiduciary are described in detail in the
                                        Uniform Prudent Investors Act (UPIA). For example, a fiduciary cannot use account contents
                                        for personal benefit but may be reimbursed for reasonable expenses incurred in managing
                                        the account. Do not confuse that with transaction costs. When determining appropriate
                                        investments, the cost of the transaction (trading commissions) is not nearly as important as
                                        how well the investment meets the needs of the account. The exam tends to focus its UPIA
                                        questions on those managing qualified retirement plans, so we’ll revisit the act in Unit 18.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   Any trades the fiduciary enters must be consistent with the trust’s investment
                                                   objectives.


                                        Opening a Fiduciary Account
                                        Opening a fiduciary account may require a court certification of the individual’s appointment
                                        and authority. An account for a trustee must include a trust agreement detailing the
                                        limitations placed on the fiduciary. No documentation of custodial rights or court
                                        certification is required for an individual to open a UGMA or UTMA account (see Unit 18).


                                        Power of Attorney
                                        If a person who is not named on an account is to have trading authority, the customer must
                                        file written authorization with the broker-dealer giving that person access to the account.
                                        Without this power in writing, no matter how tempting the answer on the exam, activity
                                        in the account cannot be created by anyone other than the account owner(s). Trading
                                        authorization usually takes the form of a power of attorney. Two basic types of trading
                                        authorizations are full and limited powers of attorney.


                                        Full Power of Attorney
                                        A full power of attorney allows an individual who is not the owner of an account to:
                                         deposit or withdraw cash or securities; and/or
                                         make investment decisions for the account owner.

                                        A limited power of attorney allows an individual to have some, but not total, control over an
                                        account. The document specifies the level of access the person may exercise.

                                               Limited power of attorney, also called limited trading authorization, allows entering of
                                               buy and sell orders but not the withdrawal of funds. Entry of orders and withdrawal of
                                               funds is only allowed if full power of attorney is granted.

                                                                                                                                                  Unit 16
                                    Durable Power of Attorney
                                    A full or limited power may be made “durable” by the grantor of the power. It is designed to
                                    provide that a specifically designated person maintains power over the account even upon the
                                    grantor’s incapacitation, whether due to physical or mental causes. Its most common use is
                                    when providing for aging parents. However, upon the death of either principal to the durable
                                    power of attorney, the power is terminated.

                                    How does this differ from the living will that we will discuss shortly? A living will is a written
                                    document making your specific end-of-life wishes known. The durable POA appoints
                                    someone to act on your behalf and make the decisions. So, if you want to be sure your wishes
                                    are followed, prepare a living will.

                                               TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                               A durable power of attorney survives the physical or mental incompetence of the
                                               grantor but not the death of either party.
                                               This means that orders entered after the time of death of the grantor, even if the
                                               purchase or sale was decided upon prior to death, are not accepted.


                                    Trust and Estate Accounts
                                    Two special kinds of accounts that may appear on the exam are those dealing with trusts and
                                    estates. What both of these have in common is that the person entering orders on behalf
                                    of the account is acting in a fiduciary capacity, whether it be the trustee of the trust or the
                                    executor (or administrator) of the estate. These fiduciaries are acting for the benefit of the
                                    beneficiary or beneficiaries of the trust or estate, so it is necessary to look at the objectives of
                                    the trust and the needs of the heirs.


                                    Trust Accounts
                                    A trust is a legal entity that offers flexibility to an individual who wishes to transfer property.
                                    Trusts may be established for a variety of personal and charitable property transfers. Trusts are also
                                    established as the legal entity for a corporate retirement plan, but that will be covered in a later unit.

                                    The subject of trust law is very complicated and should only be addressed by one who is
                                    competent in the subject, usually an attorney.

                                    This exam will require you to know the basics of trusts, how trusts are taxed, trustee
                                    responsibility, and your obligations when acting as an adviser to the account.


                                    Trust Parties
                                    For a trust to be valid, three parties must be specified in the trust document (trust agreement).
                                    These parties are a settlor, a trustee, and a beneficiary. Under certain circumstances, the settlor,
                                    trustee, and beneficiary may be the same individual. For a trust to be valid, both the settlor
                                    and the trustee must be competent parties. However, the beneficiary may be a minor or a
                                    legally incompetent adult.

                                        The Settlor
                                        The settlor is the person who supplies the property for the trust. Trust property is referred to
                                        as its principal or corpus. This party is also known as the maker, grantor, trustor, or donor.


                                        Trustee
                                        A trustee is an individual or another party holding legal title to property held for the benefit
                                        of another person (or persons). The trustee must administer the trust by following directions
                                        in a trust agreement or in a will. A trustee must perform certain duties relative to the trust
                                        property.

                                        A trustee is a fiduciary and is obliged to perform in the interest of the beneficiaries. The
                                        trustee may be one or more adult individuals or an entity in the business of trusteeship that
                                        is responsible for investing, administering, and distributing trust assets for the benefit of the
                                        beneficiary (or beneficiaries).

                                        In many ways, a trustee’s duties are like those of an executor (for an estate). However, a
                                        trustee’s duties generally continue for more time than a typical estate settlement, and the
                                        trustee is charged with the greater duty of investing trust assets.


                                        Beneficiary
                                        A beneficiary is a person for whose benefit property is held in trust. A beneficiary is one
                                        who receives or who is designated to receive benefits from property transferred by a trustor.
                                        Beneficiaries to a trust include only those persons upon whom the settlor intended to benefit
                                        from the trust property or those who would succeed their interests.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   Jill establishes a trust under which her husband, Julian, is to receive all income
                                                   produced by the trust property for as long as he lives. Upon Julian’s death, their
                                                   daughter, Janet, will receive the trust principal. Julian is a primary beneficiary.
                                                   However, until Julian’s death, Janet is a contingent beneficiary because her benefit
                                                   depends on the occurrence of an event—in this case, Julian’s death.

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   Although it doesn’t happen often, the grantor of the trust can also be the trustee and/
                                                   or the beneficiary.


                                        Remainderman
                                        When a trust has run its course and all expenses and distributions have been made, the
                                        person who receives the remaining balance is called the remainderman (no gender preference
                                        here—there’s no such term as “remainderwoman”). The most common case involves real
                                        estate. For example, the husband dies and arranges for his wife to have full use of their home
                                        until she passes away. At that time, any surviving children inherit the home. They are the
                                        remaindermen.

                                    Simple Trusts vs. Complex Trusts
                                    Simple Trusts
                                    All income earned on assets placed into a simple trust must be distributed during the year it

                                                                                                                                               Unit 16
                                    is received. If the trust does not distribute all of its net income at least annually, the trust is
                                    declared a complex trust. The trustee is not empowered to distribute the trust principal from a
                                    simple trust.


                                    Complex Trust
                                    On the other hand, a complex trust may accumulate income. A complex trust is permitted
                                    deductions for distributions of net income or principal. Capital gains are deemed part of the
                                    distributable net income of a complex trust unless reinvested. Furthermore, the trustee may
                                    distribute trust principal according to trust terms.

                                               TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                               The key difference between a simple and a complex trust is that the simple trust must
                                               distribute all of its annual income, whereas a complex trust is not obligated to do so.


                                    Living vs. Testamentary Trusts
                                    Living Trust
                                    A living trust, also known as an inter vivos trust, is established during the maker’s lifetime. A
                                    testamentary trust is established according to the instructions of a will—that is, not with the
                                    death of the maker.


                                    Testamentary Trust
                                    With a testamentary trust, the settlor retains control over assets until death (think “last will
                                    and testament”). The individual’s will stipulates that, at death, the testator’s property is to be
                                    placed in trust for the benefit of one or more beneficiaries.

                                    The testamentary trust does not reduce the grantor’s income or estate tax exposure.
                                    Furthermore, assets that pass to a testamentary trust do not avoid probate, because the
                                    validity of the will’s instructions to pass property to the trust must be substantiated in probate
                                    court.


                                    Living Will
                                    Please do not confuse a living will with a living trust or even a will. The common name for
                                    these is an advance directive or medical care directive. This has nothing to do with assets or
                                    beneficiaries. It is the individual’s instructions for end-of-life situations, such as withholding
                                    medical care or organ donation. The exam may show it as something like this:

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                       A living will is used to
                                                        A. avoid the cost and time of probate.
                                                        B. eliminate, or at least reduce, estate taxes.
                                                        C. ensure that the author’s assets are properly distributed after death.
                                                        D. express the author’s end-of-life wishes.
                                                       Answer: D. Sometimes referred to as a medical directive or advanced care directive,
                                                       a living will is used to express the author’s end-of-life wishes, such as organ donation,
                                                       “pulling the plug,” and so forth. It has nothing to do with a living trust or a last will
                                                       and testament describing the distribution of assets after death.

                                        One of the discoveries of the Madoff affair was the large amounts lost by charities and
                                        foundations. In most cases, certainly true for charities, they should be dealt with as the
                                        fiduciary accounts described above. In the case of foundations, because those are usually
                                        funded by the principals, a greater amount of investment flexibility may be called for.


                                        Philanthropic Funds
                                        Wealthy individuals may set up donor-advised funds that allow for flexibility and tax
                                        advantages. There are mutual fund sponsors and banks that offer these individuals the
                                        opportunity to donate a lump sum, take a current tax deduction, and then have the assets
                                        invested to earn over a period of time while allowing the donor to advise distributions
                                        to favored charities. If you are dealing with high net worth (HNW) clients who are of a
                                        charitable bent, there could be great merit in advising them in this direction.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                       For which of the following types of clients would the suitability requirements be
                                                       somewhat more relaxed?
                                                        A. A guardian for an orphan
                                                        B. A charity
                                                        C. A foundation
                                                        D. An executor
                                                       Answer: C. Guardians and executors are fiduciaries controlling assets of those who
                                                       cannot speak for themselves. Charities raise funds from donors expecting that the
                                                       money will be invested wisely. Foundations are generally funded by their founders,
                                                       who usually give those managing the money greater flexibility.


                                        Impact Investments
                                        Impact investing can be defined as “the intentional allocation of capital to generate a positive
                                        social or environmental impact that can be—and is—measured.”

                                        Charities and foundations usually have a specified goal, whether it be medical research (think
                                        American Cancer Society) or social goals (think Greenpeace). Impact investing is when
                                        the entity commits a portion of its funds to those companies or industries that align with
                                        those goals. It’s unlikely the Cancer Society would have tobacco stocks in its portfolio, and
                                        Greenpeace probably wouldn’t invest in strip mining companies.

                                    Impact investing is a subset of Socially Responsible Investing (SRI), which attempts to
                                    generate positive social good in addition to the goals typically outlined in an SRI approach.
                                    Where socially responsible investing fund managers are generally passive and adopt a “do
                                    no harm” approach, impact investing funds typically not only seek to create positive impact

                                                                                                                                             Unit 16
                                    but also measure and report their impact in a transparent way. The acronym “ESG” is also
                                    frequently found. This stands for environment, social, and corporate governance.

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  A socially responsible mutual fund would probably invest in companies
                                                   A. generating high returns.
                                                   B. acting with high ethics and morality.
                                                   C. located in a single geographic area.
                                                   D. with a major presence on social media.
                                                  Answer: B. SRI looks for companies with high ethical standards. A mutual fund
                                                  promoting itself and being socially responsible is going to direct its portfolio
                                                  investments to companies that meet the description.

                                    Here is a bit more about the topic, which should enable any student encountering this or a
                                    similar question to be confident in their choice of answer. The standards involved include
                                    corporate responsibility and concerns for society as valid parts of investment decisions. ESG
                                    criteria are used in an attempt to generate long-term competitive financial returns and positive
                                    societal impact.


                                    Program-Related Investments
                                    Although somewhat similar to impact investing, program-related investments are those where
                                    the foundation (more common for them than charities) makes a charitable distribution.
                                    Examples of this would be helping bring new drugs to market more quickly by providing
                                    necessary funding. One caution is that the investments must be consistent with the
                                    philanthropy’s mission in order to get the same favorable tax treatment by the IRS as a regular
                                    charitable gift would.


                                    Management Obligations
                                    In general, these foundations are managed by a board of directors having the responsibility
                                    of selecting and overseeing the activities of the investment manager. The board prepares an
                                    investment policy statement (IPS) describing their goals and objectives and uses this IPS to
                                    monitor how well the investment manager(s) adhere to the plan.

                                    As described in the specific IPS, these managers need to evaluate the expected returns and see
                                    that they outpace inflation without taking undue risk. Diversification is the key, both with the
                                    types of industry and types of security and relative risk.


                                    Account Opening Requirements
                                    Opening an account for an organization is somewhat more complicated than an individual
                                    account. In addition to information about the entity, detailed information about those
                                    individuals in a control position (officers, 10% owners, etc.) must be supplied. Significant
                                    financial information about the organization is also required in order to help determine
                                    suitability. Most broker-dealers have special account opening forms, and investments advisers
                                    usually use a different contract when dealing with an organization. We don’t expect you will
                                    see much in the way of detail on your exam.

                                        LO 16.e Describe the fundamentals of insurance and trust taxation.


                                        Income Tax Implications of Life Insurance
                                        Premiums for individually purchased life insurance are generally nondeductible for income
                                        tax purposes. Generally, proceeds from life insurance policies made to a beneficiary are exempt
                                        from federal income tax.


                                        Policy Loans
                                        When you borrow cash value from your life insurance policy, the funds received are
                                        nontaxable. This is the same as any other borrowed money—it isn’t your money and must be
                                        paid back at some time in the future. Note that if you never pay it back, the amount of the
                                        loan will be deducted from the death benefit (the insurance company will finally get back the
                                        money).


                                        Policy Surrender
                                        If a variable life insurance policy is surrendered, any cash value in excess of the basis in the
                                        policy (the premiums paid) is taxable as ordinary income.


                                        Withdrawal of Cash Value
                                        If there is a partial withdrawal of cash value from a variable life insurance policy, the FIFO
                                        (first in, first out) rules apply. This is unlike the LIFO treatment on an annuity (covered in
                                        Unit 24). Therefore, there are no tax consequences until the amount withdrawn exceeds the
                                        cost basis in the policy.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                       Which of the following are possible sources of taxable income to an individual?
                                                          I. Owning a sole proprietorship
                                                         II. Being a shareholder in a subchapter S corporation
                                                        III. Owning stocks and bonds
                                                        IV. Proceeds paid on a life insurance policy
                                                         A. I and II
                                                         B. I, II, and III
                                                         C. I, II, III, and IV
                                                         D. II and III
                                                       Answer: B. An individual can generate income from running a sole proprietorship
                                                       or being a shareholder in an S corporation (the exam will probably use the obsolete
                                                       term Subchapter S). Of course, taxable income can be generated by investments in
                                                       the form of dividends, interest, and capital gains. One very valuable feature of life
                                                       insurance is that death benefits paid to the beneficiary of a life insurance policy are
                                                       not subject to federal income tax, so choice IV is not part of the correct answer.

                                    Taxation of Social Security
                                    Taxation of Social Security is included in this LO because the Old Age, Survivors, and
                                    Disability Insurance program (OASDI) is the official name for Social Security in the United
                                    States. As much as 50% of Social Security benefits start becoming taxable once a single
                                                                                                                                              Unit 16
                                    person’s base income (IRS computation called provisional income) exceeds $25,000 and a
                                    married couple’s exceeds $32,000. Once that income exceeds $34,000 (single) or $44,000
                                    (couple), it is likely that 85% of the Social Security benefit is subject to income tax.

                                    Although we have not heard of this being tested, individuals claiming benefits prior to full
                                    retirement age will see a reduction in those benefits once earnings reach a certain point (this
                                    changes every year).


                                    Estate Tax Implications to Owning Life Insurance
                                    If someone named as the insured individual on a life insurance policy holds incidents of
                                    ownership in that policy, the entire death benefit payable under that policy is included for
                                    federal estate tax purposes in the insured individual’s estate.

                                    If a person retains the right to designate a beneficiary, transfer ownership of an insurance

                                    the accumulated cash value of the policy, or perform any other functions that are rights of
                                    ownership, then that person has incidents of ownership in the policy.


                                    Irrevocable Life Insurance Trust
                                    In light of the estate tax implications, it is frequently best that a party other than the insured
                                    own the life insurance policy in order to remove the proceeds from the estate of the insured.
                                    An effective alternative to ownership of a policy on one’s own life is to have the life insurance
                                    acquired by or transferred to an irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT). If certain provisions,
                                    known as Crummey powers, are included in the ILIT document, premiums paid by the
                                    insured may qualify for the annual gift tax exclusion (currently $16,000 in 2022, per year,
                                    per beneficiary). Please note that while the tax numbers are from 2021, we are using the 2022
                                    annual gift tax number because it is the only one that is likely to be tested.

                                              In those cases where the estate does have liquid assets such as stocks and bonds, life
                                              insurance still may serve a valuable need in that these income-producing assets will
                                              not have to be sold to cover the estate tax liability or other final expenses.

                                    Trusts are considered legal persons and may be subject to taxation. In fact, if not handled
                                    properly, the taxes can be quite onerous.


                                    Trust Tax Rates
                                    Taxation of trusts and estates is based on what is distributed and what is retained. In the case
                                    of nondistributed income, the tax consequences can be quite severe because the tax brackets
                                    are highly compressed. For example, although a joint return filed for 2021 would have to
                                    report income in excess of $628,000 to be subject to the highest tax bracket of 37%, that rate
                                    is reached once a trust or estate has nondistributed income in excess of $13,050. Obviously,
                                    this can have a major impact on investment planning.

                                                   If the trust or estate has income, it must be reported on IRS Form 1041.


                                        Distributable Net Income (DNI)
                                        Because of the onerous tax implications just described, most trusts and estates distribute their
                                        income. In the context of a trust or an estate, the taxable income is known as distributable net
                                        income (DNI). DNI determines the amount of income that may be taxable to beneficiaries
                                        (or the grantor in the case of a revocable trust), whereas the balance may be taxed to the trust
                                        as indicated above. Commissions and other fees charged for buying and selling securities held
                                        in a trust are subtracted from the trust’s DNI. Realized capital gains that are reinvested in the
                                        corpus (Latin for “body”) of the trust are not considered part of DNI.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   The Gordon Clark Trust had dividend income of $10,000 and interest income of $7,000.
                                                   In addition, the trust realized capital gains of $3,000, half of which were reinvested in
                                                   the corpus of the trust. Transaction costs for the year were $2,000. The Gordon Clark
                                                   Trust has DNI for the year of $16,500 ($10,000 + $7,000 + $1,500 – $2,000). The $1,500 of
                                                   realized gains reinvested is not part of DNI.

                                        Tax-exempt interest from municipal bonds remains tax exempt to trust beneficiaries.

                                        If the trust is revocable, all income, whether distributed or not, is taxed to the grantor. In the
                                        case of an irrevocable trust, distributed income might be taxed to the beneficiary and/or the
                                        grantor, but the topic is so complicated that we don’t expect it to be tested.


                                        Bypass Trust
                                        A bypass trust is an estate-planning tool used to take advantage of the lifetime estate tax
                                        exclusion. It is commonly used between spouses when both are U.S. citizens and takes
                                        advantage of the unified tax credit. The concept of the bypass trust is to enable a surviving
                                        spouse to take advantage of the unused lifetime exclusion of the first to die (currently
                                        $11.2 million) and add it to their exclusion. Tax legislation passed in 2010 has largely
                                        removed the need for this trust.


                                        Portability of Unused Estate Tax Exemption Under ATRA
                                        As mentioned above, the bypass trust is no longer needed. This is because the Tax Act of 2010
                                        contained the concept of portability, which permits the surviving spouse to take the unused
                                        portion of the first deceased spouse’s federal exemption and aggregate it with the surviving
                                        spouse’s unused portion.

                                        To use an example, for 2021, each living spouse has a lifetime exemption from estate tax
                                        of $11.7 million. One spouse dies in 2021, leaving their entire estate of $17 million to the
                                        other spouse. There would be no estate tax because of the unlimited marital deduction. Let’s
                                        assume that the deceased spouse has not used any of their $11.7 million exemption by making
                                        taxable gifts in previous years. If the surviving spouse dies later with the estate value up to
                                        as much as $23.4 million, the executor of that estate can use all of the spouse’s exemption
                                        of $11.7 million as well as the previously deceased’s unused portion (up to $11.7 million)
                                        needed to reduce the federal estate tax to zero.

                                               EXAMPLE
                                               Each individual in a married couple has a lifetime estate tax exclusion (2021) of
                                               $11.7 million. At the time of the first to die, the gross value of the estate is $15 million.
                                               If the provisions of the will stated that the estate was to be left to the surviving spouse,

                                                                                                                                                     Unit 16
                                               then, taking advantage of the unlimited marital deduction, all $15 million passes
                                               without estate tax and without impacting the deceased lifetime exclusion. Therefore,
                                               the surviving spouse gets the $11.7 million “left over” from the deceased, meaning that
                                               no estate tax will be due after the survivor’s passing unless the estate’s value exceeds
                                               $23.4 million.


                                    Generation-Skipping Trust (GST)
                                    Just as the name implies, a generation-skipping trust is used to pass money from family
                                    members to other members more than one generation removed (grandchildren and/or
                                    great-grandchildren). Therefore, instead of the assets being taxed upon the death of the
                                    parents and then again when their children pass them to the grandchildren, one level of estate
                                    taxation is eliminated. The combination of the marital portability and the greatly increased
                                    estate tax exclusion granted by the TCJA of 2017 will result in many fewer clients needing
                                    this kind of plan.

                                    Transfer on Death (TOD) Accounts
                                    Using a transfer on death (TOD) account is the simplest way to keep assets held in brokerage
                                    accounts from becoming subject to probate upon a client’s death and, at the same time, be
                                    distributed specifically as the account owner wishes. However, the TOD account does not
                                    avoid estate taxes if applicable. TOD accounts are available for most types of paper assets,
                                    such as savings and checking accounts in banks and credit unions, certificates of deposit,
                                    stocks, bonds, and other securities.

                                        The owner, while alive, is the only person with any rights to the property. Upon the owner’s
                                        death, the property is immediately transferred to the named beneficiaries, usually without
                                        any added cost. The owner has the right to change beneficiaries at any time and provide for
                                        unequal distribution of the assets if desired. One of the other attractive features of TOD
                                        accounts is that there is no legal documentation necessary. The only types of accounts that
                                        may be opened with a TOD designation are individual accounts, JTWROS, community
                                        property with rights of survivorship (CPWROS), and tenants by the entirety accounts.
                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   A client has an account where, upon her death, she desires that her only son will
                                                   receive 50% of the account value and her four daughters will receive 12.5% each. The
                                                   easiest way to accomplish this would be to title the account

                                                   Answer: A. Transfer on death (TOD) requires no additional legal work and allows
                                                   the account owner to designate beneficiaries in whatever percentages she wants.
                                                   Furthermore, changes can be made at any time prior to death.

                                                   You might also see this as payable on death (POD), although the term is used far more
                                                   frequently for bank accounts.


                                        Totten Trust
                                        If you have a really old bank account, you might have a Totten trust designation using
                                        language similar to “John Doe, in trust for Jane Doe” or perhaps “John Doe as trustee for Jane
                                        Doe.” Totten trusts, sometimes referred to as a “poor man’s will,” allowed for the transfer of
                                        ownership of a bank account to a beneficiary after the owner’s death. Totten trusts were the
                                        predecessor to POD or TOD designations, but a few states still recognize them.


                                        Avoiding Probate
                                        There are three primary tools used to avoid probate. One of them is to designate a beneficiary.
                                        A beneficiary designation is always found in life insurance and retirement accounts, and
                                        sometimes bank and brokerage accounts. Another way is by using a POD (pay on death)
                                        or TOD (transfer on death) designation on a bank or investment account. The third tool
                                        is to have assets titled in the names of two or more people as “joint tenants with right of
                                        survivorship” or “tenants by the entirety,” for example.

                                               PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   A customer of a broker-dealer has an IRA at the firm. Upon the death of the owner, to
                                                   determine proper distribution of the assets, the broker-dealer would examine
                                                    A. the IRA’s beneficiary designation.

                                                                                                                                              Unit 16
                                                    B. the IRA’s TOD designation.
                                                    C. the customer’s will.
                                                    D. the determination of the probate court.
                                                   Answer: A. It is rare to find an IRA that does not have a specified beneficiary or
                                                   beneficiaries. If the owner attempts to transmit the IRA through a will or trust, the
                                                   beneficiary designation will control the disposition. TOD is not used with retirement
                                                   plans, and designation of a beneficiary avoids probate.


                                    Revocable vs. Irrevocable Trusts
                                    For more elaborate estate planning, it is advised that the client consider the use of trusts.
                                    Terms of a revocable trust may be changed during the maker’s lifetime. Terms of an
                                    irrevocable trust generally cannot be changed.


                                    Revocable Trust
                                    If the grantor retains the ability to revoke the trust and take back the trust assets, the trust is
                                    revocable and the income is taxable to the grantor under the grantor trust rules. That means
                                    the grantor is subject to tax on trust income even when not actually receiving the income.
                                    Assets in a revocable trust are included in the grantor’s gross estate for federal estate tax
                                    purposes—no estate tax benefits apply. Revocable trusts are also called living trusts. They are
                                    used primarily as a will substitute. Assets in trust avoid the cost, time, expense, and publicity
                                    of probate.


                                    Irrevocable Trust
                                    For a trust to be considered irrevocable, the settlor must give up all ownership in property
                                    transferred into the trust. Property placed in an irrevocable trust is usually not includable in
                                    the trustor’s estate for federal estate tax purposes. Certain exceptions to the general rule can
                                    jeopardize the effectiveness of an irrevocable trust to reduce estate taxes, but they are unlikely
                                    to be tested.


                                    Grantor Retained Annuity Trusts (GRATs)
                                    This is an estate-planning tool designed to pass assets to beneficiaries (usually children) in a
                                    way to minimize gift and/or estate taxes. The topic is very complicated, but here are the basics
                                    you might need to know.
                                     The key is in the words grantor retained. That tells you that any income from the trust is
                                       taxed to the grantor.
                                     The annuity portion is paid for a specified number of years. At the end of that term, the
                                       beneficiaries get whatever is left, and that could be free of estate and gift taxes.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                         Sam Jones has been a successful businessman and is concerned that his youngest
                                                         daughter will not be able to live within her means. To protect this from happening,
                                                         Mr. Jones places a large sum of money into a trust for the benefit of the daughter.
                                                         Because Mr. Jones knows he won’t live forever, he arranges for the Fourth Fidelity
                                                         Bank and Trust Company to have control over the assets. Which of the following
                                                         statements is not true?
                                                           A. Sam Jones is the grantor.
                                                           B. Sam Jones is the trustee.
                                                           C. Fidelity Bank and Trust Company is the trustee.
                                                          D. Sam Jones’s daughter is the beneficiary.
                                                         Answer: B. The person (A) who funds the trust is the grantor or settlor. The bank has
                                                         been appointed to be trustee (C), and the daughter is the beneficiary (D) of the trust.
                                                         That makes choice B the untrue statement.


                                        Estate Accounts
                                        An estate account is an account that, like a trust account, is directed by a fiduciary on behalf
                                        of the beneficiary or beneficiaries of an estate. In the case of one who prepares a will, there
                                        is a specified executor. In the case of one who dies without a will (intestate), these functions
                                        are performed by a court-appointed administrator. The executor or administrator makes the
                                        investment, management, and distribution decisions for the account.


                                        Per Stirpes
                                        One common way for people to provide for their descendants is to incorporate the phrase,
                                        “to my living issue, per stirpes” in their will. In fact, some states automatically distribute in
                                        that fashion when one dies intestate. Per stirpes (not a typo—it is not stripes) is from the Latin
                                        word meaning “branch.” When used, per stirpes means that the deceased intended that a
                                        beneficiary’s share of the inheritance is to go to an heir.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   A widow (or widower) had three children and wished the estate to be distributed
                                                   equally. If one of those children died prior to the estate settlement, that child’s
                                                   children (the grandchildren of the widow or widower) would share their parent’s
                                                   one-third share (receiving one-sixth of the total each), while the two living children
                                                   would each receive a one-third share.
                                                   It would look like this:
                                                   Child A Child B Child C (deceased) Grandchildren 1 and 2
                                                   1/3       1/3      1/6                   1/6


                                        Per Capita
                                        There is another Latin term used in settling estates. This one is per capita, and it means
                                        “by total head count.” Because the procedures differ from state to state, the only question
                                        the exam can ask is that you know that per capita, along with per stirpes, is a method of
                                        determining the distribution of an estate’s assets.

                                    Suitability Issues
                                    Just as with any other account, recommendations must be suitable when considering all
                                    of the relevant information. However, in the case of a trust or an estate, there are several
                                    considerations that do not arise in other individual accounts. Some of these are as follows:
                                     In virtually all cases, the trust document declares the objectives of the trust. Generally,                Unit 16
                                       these can only be changed by the grantor or, once in receipt of the assets, the beneficiary.
                                       The trustee is obligated to invest the funds in accordance with those objectives. For
                                       example, if the objective is income until the death of the grantor, then that is the primary
                                       consideration in any recommended transaction. Always follow the terms of the trust.
                                     Unless specifically stated in the trust document, margin trading is not permitted.
                                     In the case of an estate, the terms of the will must be followed.
                                     If the investment adviser managing the account is also the trustee or executor, in addition
                                       to the normal fiduciary responsibility assumed by all investment advisers, there are the
                                       formal requirements of the Uniform Prudent Investors Act (UPIA). That act is described
                                       in detail in Unit 18, dealing with retirement plans. “Wearing two hats” is an allowable
                                       practice, but it is not done very often because of the inherent conflict of interest. This, as
                                       with all potential conflicts of interest, must be disclosed to the client.
                                     There are unique tax considerations, which will be covered in the next learning objective.
                                     In the case of trusts, conflicts between the grantor and the beneficiary may exist; in the
                                       case of estates, conflicts among the beneficiaries may arise.

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              A widow was left a trust with her children as contingent beneficiaries. She is to
                                              receive income from the trust, and her two children will receive the principal upon
                                              her death. To maximize their value, the children ask you to allocate half of the corpus
                                              to growth stocks while leaving the balance in bonds for their mother. Because the
                                              trust document calls for the widow to receive income, the adviser must pursue that
                                              objective and cannot follow the wishes of the children until the trust’s assets become
                                              theirs.

                                    When a donor makes a gift of securities or virtually any asset, the cost basis to the recipient
                                    (the donee) is the donor’s cost basis (original cost and holding period beginning from the
                                    donor’s date of purchase). This describes carryover basis.

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              In 2010, Joe Smith bought 1,000 shares of COD at $24 per share, for a total cost of
                                              $24,000. In 2017, when COD was trading at $32.50, Joe gave those 1,000 shares to
                                              his daughter, Sally. When Sally sells the shares, her cost basis is Joe’s cost basis on
                                              the date of his original purchase—$24 per share, seven years ago—not the market
                                              value on the date of the gift. So, if Sally were to sell those shares for $33 per share one
                                              month after receiving the gift, she would be realizing a long-term capital gain of $9,000.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   It gets more complicated if the securities are worth less than the donor’s cost at the
                                                   time of the gift, and we don’t expect the exam to deal with that situation.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   If a gift of securities held for more than one year (long term) is made to a 501(c)
                                                   (3) charity (that is the IRS designation for qualifying nonprofit organizations), the tax
                                                   treatment is more favorable. Under these circumstances, Joe’s deduction is based on
                                                   the fair market value on the date of the gift, not his cost basis. He would have received
                                                   a $32,500 tax deduction and avoided capital gains taxes on the $8,500 profit.


                                        Inherited Securities
                                        When a person dies and leaves securities to heirs, the cost basis to the recipients is usually the
                                        fair market value on the date of the owner’s death. In other words, the cost basis steps up to
                                        the date of death value. Furthermore, the IRS treats any gains to be long term, regardless of
                                        when the deceased purchased the security.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   In 2010, Joe Smith bought 1,000 shares of COD at $24 per share for a total cost of
                                                   $24,000. In 2017, when COD was trading at $32.50, Joe died. His daughter, Sally, is
                                                   Joe’s sole heir and inherits the 1,000 shares upon his death. When Sally sells the
                                                   shares, her cost basis is the fair market value on the date of Joe’s death—$32.50 per
                                                   share—not Joe’s original purchase cost, and any gain would be long term.

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   The step-up provision does not apply when inheriting an annuity.


                                        Estate Taxes
                                        As previously mentioned, one of the purposes of establishing a trust is to minimize estate
                                        taxation. Let’s look further in the process of taxing an estate.

                                        The federal government imposes a tax on a decedent’s estate based on the value of the estate,
                                        as well as on gifts conveyed to heirs, before a person dies.

                                        Estate tax is imposed on the transfer of substantial amounts of property at death. An
                                        individual may transfer an unlimited amount to a spouse who is a U.S. citizen without
                                        the imposition of federal estate tax. This is known as the marital deduction. In addition, an
                                        individual may transfer unlimited amounts of money and other property to an eligible charity
                                        with no federal estate tax. For heirs other than spouses, an estate tax credit will offset estate tax
                                        on transfers of up to $ 11.7 million in 2021, indexed for inflation of property. We discussed
                                        some ways to reduce or eliminate estate taxes earlier in this unit.


                                        The Gross Estate vs. the Taxable Estate
                                        Federal estate tax is calculated using a formula that begins with the gross estate. The gross
                                        estate includes all interests in property held by an individual at the time of death. Although
                                        amounts of property transferred to a spouse or a charity will generally not be subject to federal
                                        estate tax, such amounts are includable in calculating the gross estate.

                                    Certain expenses are then deducted from the gross estate to arrive at the adjusted gross
                                    estate (AGE). Examples of deductions for the AGE include funeral expenses, charitable
                                    contributions, and debts of the decedent.

                                    Once the amount of the AGE is determined, the unlimited marital and charitable deductions
                                    are subtracted to arrive at the taxable estate.                                                             Unit 16

                                               EXAMPLE
                                               Caroline, who is unmarried, died in 2021, owning various properties. The amount
                                               of her gross estate is $18 million. However, her estate incurred $20,000 in funeral
                                               expenses, she had made charitable gifts of $1,000,000, and she owed mortgages
                                               of $200,000 and $30,000 in credit card balances. Thus, her adjusted gross estate
                                               is $16,750,000. In 2021, because of an estate tax credit that exempted the first
                                               $11,700,000 of property transferred after death, Caroline’s estate will be taxed on the
                                               remaining $5,050,000 in transferred property.


                                    Alternative Valuation Date
                                    The Internal Revenue Code provides that the executor of an estate may choose to value the
                                    assets in the estate as of the date of death or, alternatively, six months later. This is particularly
                                    beneficial if the estate consists of assets that have dropped substantially in value following
                                    the date of death. What value is used if an asset that is appraised at the date of death is
                                    subsequently sold for a different price? The executor will use that sale price as long as it
                                    represents the fair market value (FMV).

                                    In the case of mutual funds, FMV is the NAV, not the POP.

                                               TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                               If an asset is sold after death at a greatly reduced price from its appraised value in a
                                               transaction that does not meet the definition required under fair market value, the IRS
                                               will use the higher value.


                                    Payment Date of Estate Taxes
                                    Regardless of whether the date of death or alternative valuation date is used, estate taxes are
                                    due no later than nine months after death. Just as with personal income taxes, it is possible to
                                    get an extension to file the return, but the taxes are due at the nine months’ time and interest
                                    will be charged on any amount owed that is not paid at that time.

                                               TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                               The computation of the estate tax is done on IRS Form 706. From the gross assets,
                                               certain expenses (such as the costs of administration of the estate, funeral expenses,
                                               payments of outstanding debts, and charitable bequests) are deducted, and the tax is
                                               levied on the remaining taxable estate.


                                    Taxation of Estate Income
                                    During the period of time before the estate is liquidated (and estates that are contested can
                                    drag on for years), it is likely that the executor will manage the assets in such a fashion that
                                    the estate receives income and possibly capital gains. If this is the case, the taxation to the
                                    estate is at the same rates mentioned earlier regarding trusts and, as with trusts, Form 1041




16_0-2532_LEM_65E_Unit16.indd 393                                                                                                         28/10/22 2:46 PM

                                        is used to report the income. Furthermore, the income is taxed using the same compressed
                                        brackets as trust income (37% for everything in excess of $13,050 in 2021).

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   Just as you may have to know that the estate tax computation is done on Form 706,
                                                   you may also have to know that the estate income tax computation is done on Form
                                                   1041.


                                        Donor’s Gift Tax Obligation
                                        Gift tax is a progressive federal tax imposed on the transfer of property during the lifetime of
                                        the donor; up to $11.7 million (2021) in lifetime gifts may be made without incurring gift
                                        tax. Additionally, an individual may give up to $16,000 per year (2022, indexed for inflation
                                        in $1,000 increments) to any number of individuals without generating the federal gift tax.
                                        If a married couple joins in the gift, the allowable amount is doubled to $32,000 (2022) per
                                        person per year. Gifts of securities are valued as of the current market price on the date of the
                                        gift. Please don’t confuse this with cost basis of a gift discussed earlier in this unit.

                                        When a gift is made between spouses, the rule is somewhat different. Generally, there is an
                                        unlimited exclusion for these gifts. However, there are limits if your spouse is not a citizen
                                        of the United States. In 2021, a spouse may gift up to $159,000 to a noncitizen spouse. The
                                        number won’t be tested because it changes each year, but the concept might be on your exam.

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   Generally, a gift tax return must be filed whenever a gift in excess of $16,000 (or
                                                   whatever the annual exclusion is at the time of the gift) is made to any individual
                                                   (other than a spouse). Any excess over the annual exclusion is applied against the
                                                   lifetime exclusion until it is used up.
                                                   The return is filed on Form 709 and is due at the same time as the donor’s income tax
                                                   return, generally April 15.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   If a gift tax is due, it is the responsibility of the giver of the gift (donor), not the receiver
                                                   of the gift (donee).

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   This concept is pretty simple: you have some stock worth $22,000 and give it to a child
                                                   or grandchild; you’ve exceeded the $16,000 annual gift exclusion, so a gift tax return
                                                   would have to be filed. However, it might look like this on your exam: “A grandfather
                                                   received stock as a result of demutualization that is currently worth $22,000 and
                                                   wishes to give it to his grandchild.” Most students would waste their time trying to
                                                   figure out what demutualization means and not realize how simple the question really
                                                   is. It makes no difference how the stock was acquired; for gift tax purposes, the only
                                                   thing that counts is the fair market value on the date of the gift.

                                    TAKE NOTE
                                    Taxation of estates and gifts are unified. That means that whatever is used of the
                                    lifetime gift exclusion prior to death reduces the estate tax exclusion. Both have a
                                    lifetime exclusion (2021) of 11.7 million and both have a progressive structure with

                                                                                                                                       Unit 16
                                    rates beginning at 18% and reaching a maximum tax rate (2021) of 40%. There are two
                                    testable differences:
                                    1. the annual gift tax exclusion ($16,000 in 2022); and
                                    2. gift taxes are due at the same time as the individual tax return (April 15), while
                                       estate taxes are due nine months after death.

                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                    The concept of taxation relating to gifts and inheritances can be confusing. There
                                    are two separate taxable situations: taxes due on the proceeds of a sale of gifted or
                                    inherited property and taxes due based on the amount of the gift or the estate.
                                    The following information should help:
                                    1. A client has received a gift of securities from someone, or the client has inherited
                                       securities.
                                    Gift: The client’s cost basis for determining if there is a taxable capital gain is that
                                    of the donor. The client is considered to have acquired the security on the donor’s
                                    purchase date and at the donor’s purchase price.
                                    Inheritance: The client’s cost basis for determining if there is a taxable capital gain
                                    is the fair market value (FMV) as of the date of death. The holding period is not a
                                    consideration because any gains are considered long term.
                                    2. Your client made a gift of securities to someone, or the client has died.
                                    Gift: The obligation to pay a gift tax is that of the donor. Anything over the annual
                                    exclusion (currently $16,000) may be subject to the gift tax (unless used against the
                                    lifetime exclusion of $11.2 million). The amount of the gift for tax purposes is the FMV
                                    as of the date of the gift.
                                    Estate: The obligation to pay an estate tax is that of the deceased’s estate. The value
                                    used to determine if there is an estate tax liability is the FMV either as of the date of
                                    death or, by using the alternative valuation date, the FMV six months after death. As
                                    with the gift tax, there is the unified credit of $11.2 million.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                        Bruno and Griselde have been married for 56 years. Bruno passes away in 2021 and
                                                        leaves his entire estate of $10 million to his wife. During his lifetime, Bruno had used
                                                        $2 million of his lifetime gift exclusion. Upon Griselde’s death 2 years later, the estate
                                                        is worth $22.2 million. The gross taxable estate is
                                                          A. $0.00.
                                                          B. $800,000.
                                                          C. $2 million.
                                                          D. $11 million.
                                                        Answer: B. Because Bruno used $2 million, his estate tax exclusion is now
                                                        $9.7 million. The portability provisions allow that to be added to Griselde’s exclusion,
                                                        making the total $21.4 million ($9.7 + $11.7 = $21.4 million). With a gross value of
                                                        $22.2 million and a remaining exclusion of $21.4 million, prior to any deductions, the
                                                        gross taxable estate is $800,000 million.

                        automatically go to the survivor(s), so probate

             INTRODUCTION
                                    An adviser must be familiar with each client’s circumstances, financial goals, and needs to
                                    formulate suitable investment recommendations. Without suitability information, the account
                                    cannot be opened. This is unlike broker-dealers that are permitted to open client accounts
                                    without suitability information.

                                    to determine the client’s current and future financial situation,
                                    including financial and nonfinancial considerations.


                                    Methods of Information Gathering
                                    How is all of the information necessary to complete the customer profile obtained? Although
                                    there is no universal method, most firms rely on a combination of tools. The first step is usually
                                    having the client complete a detailed questionnaire. Optimally, this should be followed up

                                                                                                                                           399

                                         by a personal interview, either in the office or home, on the phone, or online with one of
                                         the various video services currently available. There is only so much one can learn from a
                                         form, and both the client and the IAR benefit from the give-and-take of an interview, as
                                         that is the best way to discover qualitative information, such as risk tolerance and attitudes.
                                         As covered elsewhere in this course, confidentiality and security of these customer data is
                                         critical. Traditionally, data-gathering techniques for financial advisers involve asking clients or
                                         prospects to bring in account statements, insurance policies, 401(k) plan options, and maybe
                                         tax returns. Why is all of this information needed? Without it, there is no way to determine
                                         suitability. Furthermore, as learned in the previous unit, the CIP requires certain information.


                                         Customer Financial Profile
                                         A financial profile should include an assessment of the client’s:
                                          current expenditures;
                                          debt obligations;
                                          tax status;
                                          income sources;
                                          a balance sheet containing the client’s assets, including
                                            –– cash, CDs, and savings accounts (usually looked at as an “emergency fund,” generally
                                                considered to be a primary requirement for investing in securities),
                                                 –– real estate holdings,
                                                 –– value and composition of securities holdings,
                                                 –– pension and retirement accounts,
                                                 –– cash value in life insurance policies,
                                                 –– personal items such as jewelry and automobiles; and
                                          liabilities, including
                                            –– current debt obligations (credit cards, estimated tax payments, etc.),
                                                 –– long-term debt obligations (auto loan, mortgage, etc.),
                                                 –– loans against insurance cash value, and
                                                 –– loans against a 401(k) plan.

                                         Using this information, the adviser will prepare a family balance sheet. This balance sheet
                                         reflects all of the client’s assets and liabilities in order to determine the overall net worth and
                                         liquidity of that client, while a family income statement includes income and expenses and is
                                         used to determine the client’s cash flow.

                                         Taking into consideration all of this information indicates to the securities professional the
                                         extent to which the client is able to make a lump-sum investment (the balance sheet shows
                                         a large amount of net assets available) and/or periodic investments (the income statement
                                         reveals a positive cash flow; there is “money left at the end of the month”).

                                         Because things can change, it is recommended that there be a follow-up meeting with the
                                         client at least annually.

                                                       TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                       A family balance sheet includes only assets and liabilities, not income like salary,
                                                       dividends or interest, or amounts paid for expenses.

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   An individual’s net worth is
                                                    A. the difference between the individual’s assets and the individual’s liabilities.
                                                    B. best determined by examining the individual’s personal income statement.
                                                    C. largely irrelevant in identifying the individual’s investment objectives.
                                                    D. another term for discretionary income.
                                                   Answer: A. An individual’s net worth is the difference between the individual’s assets
                                                   and the individual’s liabilities. It is determined from the personal balance sheet rather
                                                   than from the personal income statement. Net worth is relevant in determining an
                                                   individual’s investment objectives. Clients with a negative net worth might find it
                                                   preferable to reduce their debt level before beginning an investment program.


                                    Customer Nonfinancial Investment Considerations

                                                                                                                                                Unit 17
                                    The previous discussion described a number of financial considerations. How do those
                                    contrast with nonfinancial ones? In its simplest form, the contrast is that one deals with
                                    monetary numbers and the other does not. In the first case, we are gathering assets, liabilities,
                                    income, and expenses. Now, we will look at nonmonetary items.

                                    A client’s nonfinancial considerations can be more important than the financial information.
                                    Relevant nonfinancial information includes the following:
                                     Age
                                     Marital status
                                     Investment experience
                                     Attitudes and values, such as “ESG” investing
                                     Number and age of dependents
                                     Employment stability
                                     Employment of family members
                                     Demographics (where clients live can affect their investment attitudes)
                                     Current and future family educational needs
                                     Current and future family health care needs


                                    Behavioral Finance
                                    There is one other nonfinancial consideration that has gained greater prominence after the
                                    2017 Nobel Prize in economic sciences was awarded to Richard H. Thaler for his work in the
                                    field. Briefly, the premise is that investors are irrational when it comes to making investment
                                    decisions. The study of this is known as behavioral finance. On the exam, it may be referred to
                                    as the study of how human psychology affects people’s investing decisions.

                                    The “dean” of behavioral finance, Daniel Kahneman, PhD, was awarded the Nobel Prize in
                                    this same field in 2002. In the announcement from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences,
                                    they stated, “His team’s findings have countered some assumptions of traditional economic
                                    theory—that people make rational choices based on their self-interest—by showing that
                                    people frequently fail to fully analyze situations where they must make complex judgments.
                                    Instead, people often make decisions using rules of thumb rather than rational analysis, and
                                    they base those decisions on factors economists traditionally don’t consider, such as fairness,
                                    past events, and aversion to loss.”

                                         Today, it is accepted that behavioral biases can cause investors to make financial decisions that
                                         are irrational. Here are some of the more common examples:
                                          Overconfidence. Experienced (and even some “rookie”) investors tend to overestimate
                                            their ability and the accuracy of the information available to them.
                                          Conservatism. Many investors have a hard time changing their existing beliefs, even when
                                            new information is presented to them.
                                          Herd behavior. A market drop may be followed by panic selling.
                                          Anchoring. The tendency to base expectations upon the first information received which
                                            may or may not be accurate. Once a thought has been anchored in your mind, it is
                                            difficult to move away from it.
                                          Regret aversion. The investor prepares himself in such a way as to avoid distress over an
                                            adverse outcome (think about a trip to Las Vegas where you know you will probably lose,
                                            but you condition yourself to expect that).
                                          Confirmation bias. This occurs when individuals look for new information or distort
                                            new information to support an existing view. Clients who get involved with the portfolio
                                            process by researching some of their portfolio holdings may become overly attached to
                                            some holdings and only bring up information favorable to the holding. This often leads to
                                            holding a security too long or failing to adequately diversify.

                                                   EXAMPLE        Confirmation Bias
                                                   Brenda has been employed by LRC Trucking for 25 years, and she feels she has more
                                                   information as an employee of LRC than those who are not employed by the company.
                                                   This, in fact, is not the case. Based on her perception, Brenda invests most of her
                                                   portfolio in RBC stock. This will result in underdiversification of Brenda’s portfolio, may
                                                   likely increase her risk, and may subject her to losses that could have been mitigated
                                                   had her portfolio been more diverse.



                                         LO 17.b Discover the client’s risk tolerance.

                                         Definition: risk tolerance. Risk tolerance is the degree to which an investor is willing and
                                         able to accept the possibility of an uncertain outcome to an economic decision. A measure of
                                         risk tolerance is useful in summarizing an investor’s perception about the trade-off between
                                         risk and the compensation required for bearing risk.

                                         Risk tolerance is a two-dimensional process. First is the investor’s attitude toward risk and
                                         safety. Emotionally, some investors, even very wealthy ones, cannot handle the idea of losing
                                         money. An investor may have more than enough assets to absorb a large loss, but taking that
                                         loss would cause much distress. The second dimension is the financial ability to sustain losses.
                                         An investor may be a gambler at heart, but, with limited assets, cannot take much investment
                                         risk. It is the juggling of these two dimensions that should be used to determine the overall
                                         risk tolerance and shape the portfolio. The SEC states that a recommended securities
                                         transaction must comport with the customer’s risk tolerance. The mere fact that a customer
                                         may be wealthy does not provide a basis for recommending risky investments, if the customer
                                         is risk averse. (“Suitability is determined by the appropriateness of the investment for the
                                         investor, not simply whether the salesman believes that the investor can afford to lose the
                                         money invested.”) The customer’s risk tolerance will be determined in light of all aspects of a
                                         transaction that bear on its potential risk of loss for the customer judging:

                                       profitable, the expected time horizon for achieving profitability, the volatility of its market
                                       value, and the liquidity of the market for it);
                                     the level of margin, if any, utilized in the transaction;
                                     the extent to which the investment may represent a concentration of investment risk for
                                       the customer in a single transaction or security; and
                                     the customer’s financial capacity to hold the investment in down markets.1
                                    Selection of specific types of investments (e.g., stocks, bonds, annuities) depends on several
                                    factors, including:
                                     Client’s objectives
                                     Amount available for investing (client must use discretionary cash for investing, not the
                                       rent money)

                                     Client’s aversion to risk (every investment involves some degree of risk because every
                                       investment requires transferring purchasing power from the present to the future, and no
                                       one knows what the future holds)

                                              An example of a question that could help an adviser determine the client’s risk
                                              tolerance is: “How much of a loss of principal are you willing (or able) to accept: 5%,
                                              15%, 30%, or even more?”


                                    Categories of Risk Tolerance
                                    A person’s risk tolerance is often characterized as aggressive, moderate, or conservative.


                                    Aggressive
                                    Aggressive investors are willing to risk greater amounts and withstand market volatility in
                                    exchange for the chance to realize substantial returns. An aggressive investor may be willing to
                                    sustain losses of 10%, 25%, or even 50% on an investment.


                                    Moderate
                                    Moderate investors are in between the other two. They can tolerate some loss, but not nearly
                                    at the level of the aggressive investor.


                                    Conservative
                                    Conservative investors normally want the relative safety of guaranteed income with low risk
                                    to loss of principal. Very conservative investors are unwilling to sustain even modest losses on
                                    their investments. There is a full spectrum of risk profiles between these two extremes.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    An investor who claims to be aggressive but is unwilling to sustain losses is actually
                                                    conservative.

                                         A client’s tolerance for volatility and risk will often narrow the field of potential investments.

                                                         determine the client’s

                                                         Security number are legal requirements for opening the account, but they don’t enter
                                                         into the decision-making process for portfolio design. Yes, you will want to know the

                                                         your recommendations.

             LESSON 17.2: INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AND CONSTRAINTS
                                    LO 17.c Distinguish between investment objectives and investment
                                    constraints.


                                    Investment Goals
                                    Using the information gathered about a client’s circumstances and financial resources, the
                                    agent (or IAR) and client should establish financial goals. Many investors confuse goals and
                                    objectives. A goal is where you want to be (the “end game”), while objectives are the steps
                                    taken along the way to reach the goal. Some commonly specified goals include:
                                     planning for college education;
                                     retirement;
                                     saving for a future purchase, such as a home;                                                       Unit 17
                                     philanthropy;
                                     capital to start a business; and
                                     leaving a legacy.


                                    Investment Objectives
                                    Investment objectives are the tools used to reach these goals. There are three primary
                                    objectives:
                                     Growth
                                     Income
                                     Stability (capital preservation)
                                    However, in attempting to meet these objectives, there may be some obstacles, properly
                                    referred to as investment constraints, which must be considered. Let’s examine some objectives
                                    in greater detail.

                                    As stated previously, when it comes to investment objectives, there are three broad classes with
                                    many shades in between:
                                     Growth (can be aggressive, moderate, or even conservative)
                                     Income (can be current, future, or high risk)
                                     Preservation of capital (safety)
                                    There is a specific term for an objective that can be maximum income or maximum growth
                                    without regard to stability—that term is speculation.

                                         Matching Client Objectives




                                         You might find the concepts of investment objectives easier to understand if we use a little
                                         geometry. The picture is of an equilateral triangle. That means each of the sides (legs) is of
                                         the same length (equal). You will notice a letter at each point. The G is for growth, the I is
                                         for income, and the S is for safety (preservation of capital). Borrowing another term from
                                         geometry, it is axiomatic (true) that the closer you move on the leg to one of these points
                                         (objective), the farther you move from the others.

                                         For example, if you wish to maximize your growth, you go all the way to the G and move
                                         farther away from the I and the S. As a result, you sacrifice income and safety. Total safety
                                         (all the way to the S) sacrifices growth and income, and maximum income sacrifices growth
                                         and safety. The role of the registered representative is to determine where in this triangle the
                                         customer’s objectives lie. They can be between the G and I when the objective is growth with
                                         income. Or, if the objective is income with safety, the point will be between the I and the S. It
                                         is important to understand that you can’t maximize all three—something has to give.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                        Which of the following is properly referred to as an investment goal rather than an
                                                        objective?
                                                         A. Current income
                                                         B. Endowing a scholarship at your alma mater
                                                         C. Conservative growth
                                                         D. Speculation
                                                        Answer: B. Goals are what you hope to have the money for. Objectives are the way to
                                                        get there. Remember the triangle for G, I, and S. The S is for stability. The opposite of
                                                        stability is speculation, and that is another one of the objectives. For some investors,
                                                        that is the route they choose to take.


                                         Within the parameters determined by a client’s circumstances and financial resources, the
                                         adviser and client should establish financial goals. The most commonly specified goals include
                                         capital preservation, current income, capital growth, and speculation. The objectives behind
                                         these goals may be planning for college education, retirement, death, or disability.

                                         However, in attempting to meet these objectives, there may be some obstacles, properly
                                         referred to as investment constraints, which must be considered. When an investment adviser
                                         or IAR prepares a plan for a client, all of these factors are used to prepare an investment policy
                                         statement (IPS) as we described in the previous unit. The following chart may be helpful in
                                         your review of objectives and constraints

                                    Preservation of Capital
                                    Many people are averse to any decline in value of their investments. For such investors, bank-
                                    insured CDs, savings accounts, and money market funds offer the safety they seek. However,
                                    by reducing market risk (there is little or no market price fluctuation in these instruments),
                                    the investor is sacrificing the opportunity for higher income. In addition, as fixed-income
                                    investments, they are exposed to inflation (purchasing power) risk.


                                    Bank-Insured Certificates of Deposit (CDs)
                                    In addition to the questions about the jumbo (negotiable) CDs that trade in the money
                                    market, there are questions on the exam about the certificates of deposit that you can get at
                                    your local bank. Here are some points that will help you get the right answer.
                                     Bank CDs eliminate interest rate risk (their value remains constant, even when interest
                                       rates change).
                                     They are not savings accounts with a maturity date.
                                     They would be included as an asset on a family balance sheet.
                                     They are the preferred answer when the question asks about a client who wants capital
                                       preservation with no risk of loss.
                                     They are insured by the FDIC up to the current limit (limits are not tested).
                                     Each bank sets the interest rate it will pay on those CDs, with smaller banks typically
                                       offering more competitive rates.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    On the exam, the first choice for preservation of capital should always be bank-insured
                                                    CDs. In addition, because they are not marketable (traded in any marketplace), bank
                                                    CDs (we’re referring to the ones retail investors purchase at their local branches—not
                                                    the jumbo CDs traded in the money market) have no interest rate risk. That is, because
                                                    their value is fixed, you can always redeem them at face value, regardless of the
                                                    direction of interest rates. The exam will ignore the fact that there may be a penalty for
                                                    cashing in before maturity.


                                         Current Income
                                         Investors seeking current income will normally focus on individual securities or mutual funds
                                         that invest in fixed-income investments such as:
                                          government bonds and notes, and agency bonds;
                                          corporate bonds;
                                          preferred stock; and
                                          utility company common stock.
                                         When the investor’s goal is income, a primary factor is the amount of risk the investor is
                                         willing and/or able to take. The risk/reward principle is quite clear—the more risk, the greater
                                         the potential reward and, logically, the lower the risk, the lower the potential reward. That is
                                         why, at least for those with a low risk tolerance but with a time horizon that doesn’t require
                                         money market instruments, U.S. Treasury and agency issues, along with investment grade
                                         bonds, are usually the recommendations. On the other end of the spectrum are bonds of
                                         corporations with very low credit ratings (the high-yield, or junk, bonds). These bonds tend to
                                         yield high income with principal subject to credit (default) risk. In the middle might be those
                                         investing in preferred stock or public utility stocks.


                                         Capital Growth
                                         Common stock investments generally provide a means to preserve and increase the buying
                                         power of an investor’s money over and above the inflation rate. Although subject to
                                         short-term volatility, the equity market tends to provide higher investment returns over time.

                                         As with income, the term growth refers to a broad spectrum of investments. Aggressive growth
                                         stocks may be very appropriate for a person with a very high tolerance for risk and the ability to
                                         remain invested for many years. At the other end of the spectrum are large capitalization stock
                                         funds that invest in some of the largest and most respected companies. These funds may be a
                                         better choice for older investors, who may need to liquidate the investment in three to five years,
                                         or investors who are more comfortable knowing they have invested in a fund that is less risky.


                                         Speculation
                                         A customer may want to speculate with a portion of their investments. Speculative
                                         investments offer the opportunity to earn substantial returns but carry a commensurate
                                         amount of risk. Speculative investments may include:
                                          highly volatile stocks;
                                          high-yield (junk) bonds;
                                          options on stocks or stock indexes; and
                                          commodity futures.

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   An 83-year-old widower explains to you that he is risk averse and wishes to find an
                                                   investment that will provide him with preservation of capital. Which of the following
                                                   might you recommend?
                                                     A. An index fund
                                                     B. Bank-insured CDs
                                                     C. Long-term U.S. government bonds
                                                     D. Preferred stock
                                                   Answer: B. There are two answers for preservation of capital on this exam. The
                                                   strongest is a bank-insured CD, followed by a money market fund (you’ll never have
                                                   both in the same question). Aren’t U.S. government bonds safe, you ask? Yes, but,
                                                   with maturities of 10 years or longer, that long duration involves interest rate risk. So,
                                                   if the client needs money now and interest rates have increased, the principal has
                                                   declined in value.


                                    College Tuition                                                                                              Unit 17
                                    In addition to other types of investments, investors planning for college tuition often invest
                                    in zero-coupon bonds that mature when the tuition expenses are due. It may be advisable to
                                    establish college tuition investment programs such as Coverdell ESAs and Section 529 plans
                                    because of their tax advantages. The investments selected for either of these two have time
                                    horizon as a major constraint; that is, if the plan is started when the child is very young, the
                                    portfolio can be more aggressive than if started only a few years before the funds are needed.


                                    Retirement
                                    In determining a client’s retirement needs, Social Security, company pensions, retirement
                                    savings accounts, and insurance (as well as investments outside of a retirement planning
                                    framework) should all be considered.

                                    Once again, time horizon is an important constraint. The earlier an individual begins to save
                                    for retirement, the more time the investment assets are able to grow. A long-term retirement
                                    planning time horizon may enable an investor to assume additional risk in the portfolio,
                                    generally through equities. This helps a client accumulate significant funds to support a long
                                    retirement period. As life expectancy has risen, the topic of decumulation has come into focus.
                                    How do we make sure that the money accumulated lasts long enough? One way to minimize
                                    longevity risk is through the purchase of annuities (fixed, index, and variable), because payout
                                    is guaranteed for life. In fact, there is a specialized annuity product known as the longevity
                                    annuity, or deferred income annuity, designed specifically to cover that risk.


                                    Social Security
                                    The OASDI (Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Income) program, which for most Americans
                                    means Social Security, provides monthly benefits designed to replace, in part, the loss of
                                    income due to retirement, disability, or death. For too many individuals, Social Security
                                    remains their primary source of retirement income. It was never designed to be the sole source
                                    and should be thought of as a supplement to funds created in retirement plans such as IRAs
                                    and 401(k) plans (these will be covered in Unit 18). The exam may ask several questions about
                                    this topic, including length of time necessary for full coverage, spousal benefits, and timing of
                                    beginning benefit payout. Here are the key points:
                                     In order to qualify for full benefits, an individual must have at least 40 quarters of
                                       employment.

                                          Waiting until age 70 to claim benefits gives the individual an 8% annual simple interest
                                            increase in the benefit from full retirement age. If you don’t need the funds and are in
                                            good health, it is generally worth the wait.
                                          Benefits for an ex-spouse. Let’s use a male with an ex-wife and a current wife. Basically,
                                            both women are entitled to benefits when the man is still alive, and both can be entitled
                                            to widow’s benefits. The topic is complicated, so any test questions probably deal with the
                                            most important basics. The most important rules are:
                                                 –– If you’re divorced and were married to the man for at least 10 years, you’re eligible for
                                                    some of your ex’s Social Security;
                                                 –– In addition to the 10-year requirement, you must be unmarried at the time you
                                                    become eligible to place a claim on your ex’s Social Security; and
                                                 –– Any benefits paid to a divorced spouse DO NOT reduce any payments due the
                                                    ex’s current spouse if he remarried. That can mean two (or more) women receiving
                                                    identical benefits while the man receives his as well.


                                         Death Benefits
                                         Because death can eliminate a family’s primary income earner, life insurance is an important
                                         component of customer portfolios. Most experts feel that an investment plan should not
                                         commence without the breadwinner(s) having adequate life insurance. One commonly used
                                         tool to determine that amount is the capital needs analysis.


                                         Capital Needs Analysis
                                         A capital needs analysis is used to determine how much life insurance is necessary to meet
                                         future needs. At a minimum, life insurance coverage should provide for:
                                          payoff of the client’s mortgage and other debts;
                                          income for the survivor(s) for a reasonable time;
                                          tuition for higher education; and
                                          estate taxes if the taxable estate will exceed $11.7 million in 2021.
                                         There are several factors used in the computation to evaluate how much is necessary to
                                         meet these needs. First, we try to project the client’s future earnings. Then, we estimate life
                                         expectancy, and, of course, we must account for inflation. Because the death benefit in a life
                                         insurance policy is generally a fixed amount, we are not concerned about market volatility.
                                         Finally, we look at existing assets such as savings and investments, including those that offer
                                         tax deferrals such as IRAs and employer-sponsored plans.

                                                   Answer: C. Typically, a life insurance policy has a guaranteed death benefit, so, even
                                                   with a variable life policy, market fluctuations will not lead to a benefit below that
                                                   minimum. The needs analysis must look into the future (we don’t expect the insured
                                                   to die today), so future earnings and inflation must be taken into consideration. The
                                                   mortgage schedule shows the outstanding balance until the mortgage is paid off—
                                                   the insurance policy needs to be able to cover that.


                                    Disability
                                    Should a client become disabled, there are three possible sources of replacement income:
                                    workers’ compensation, Social Security, and disability insurance.


                                    Workers’ Compensation
                                    If an employee is injured on the job, workers’ compensation can provide protection to cover
                                                                                                                                              Unit 17
                                    medical expenses, replace lost income, and provide death benefits to the family. Although
                                    the worker’s compensation benefits in some states (benefits vary from state to state) are quite
                                    generous (usually higher than Social Security disability), payments are made only when the
                                    disability results from a work-related injury.


                                    Social Security
                                    Like other Social Security benefits, a worker’s disability benefit will depend on a number of
                                    factors, such as age and income. However, in order to receive payments, you must meet their
                                    strict definition of disabled, which is:

                                    You must not be able to engage in any substantial gainful activity (SGA) because of a
                                    medically determinable physical or mental impairment(s)
                                     that is expected to result in death; or
                                     that has lasted or is expected to last for a continuous period of at least 12 months.


                                    Disability Insurance
                                    Because workers’ compensation only covers people in limited cases and because Social
                                    Security’s definition of disabled is relatively strict, most agree that it is wise to purchase a
                                    private disability insurance policy. Waiting and benefit periods can be adjusted based on the
                                    client’s needs and finances. The amount of insurance can be determined by the information
                                    derived from the client’s income, assets, and occupation.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              An application for disability insurance coverage can be denied in the case of a
                                              hazardous occupation.


                                    Tax Planning
                                    A client’s tax situation is often an important factor in determining suitable investments. Taxes
                                    may be reduced by using the following three strategies: asset and income shifting, tax deferral,
                                    or tax-free income.

                                         Asset and Income Shifting
                                         A client can shift investment assets and income to a person in a lower tax bracket. Until early
                                         2006, it was common to place income-producing assets in the name of a child aged 14 or
                                         older to avoid the “kiddie” tax (see Unit 24), but because it now includes all children under
                                         age 19 and full-time students under age 24, the practice has lost much of its luster. However,
                                         with many of today’s baby boomers supporting elderly parents, placing those assets in the
                                         parent’s name will remove the income from your client and let the parent receive the income
                                         directly, with little or no tax liability. As mentioned previously, trusts may also be used to shift
                                         assets and income.


                                         Tax Deferral
                                         Contributions to a qualified retirement plan or tax-sheltered annuity are not taxed until
                                         withdrawn. Investing funds that have not been taxed allows a substantially larger portion of
                                         the investor’s money to earn income or capital gains, also not taxed until withdrawn.


                                         Tax-Free Income
                                         Most municipal bonds pay interest that is free from federal taxation, although they are
                                         generally subject to state income tax unless issued in the taxpayer’s state of residence.
                                         Municipal bonds generally pay a lower interest rate than taxable bonds but, depending on the
                                         investor’s tax bracket, may result in higher returns on an after-tax basis.


                                         Lifecycle Considerations
                                         An investor’s goals may change over time. This is especially true as investors move from one
                                         phase of life to another. For example, a young couple may have a primary goal of funding
                                         a child’s education. Later, the same family, having provided for their children’s education,
                                         may turn their attention to the aggressive accumulation of wealth, perhaps to provide for an
                                         early retirement or a dream home. Upon retirement, this couple may need to move toward
                                         income-producing investments. Income and net worth change over time, as do investment
                                         goals and lifecycle considerations. Because the adviser’s responsibility to know your client is
                                         ongoing, the account form should be updated regularly to reflect the client’s new goals and
                                         financial considerations.

                                         As the baby boomer generation reaches retirement age, regulators have increased their focus
                                         on protecting senior investors. Among the suggested practices is to take detailed notes of
                                         conversations and, when it becomes apparent that the client is not grasping information as
                                         well as before, recommend that a family member or other competent person participate in all
                                         discussions.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    Other potential sources of tax-free earnings are Section 529 plans, Roth IRAs, and
                                                    Coverdell ESAs, all covered in Unit 18.

                                         Time Horizon
                                         An investor’s time horizon and liquidity needs will determine the level of volatility the client
                                         should assume. Over a 20- or 30-year time frame, dramatic short-term volatility is acceptable,

                                    even to those who are risk averse. Money that will be needed within 3 to 5 years should
                                    be invested for safety and liquidity. Time horizon is a particularly important investment
                                    constraint when planning for college education and for retirement.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              The longer the time horizon, the more market risk the account can accept, and vice
                                              versa.

                                              EXAMPLE
                                               A married couple is 55 and 57 years old. The older of the two plans to retire at 62 and the
                                               younger at 65, and both are healthy. What is the most appropriate estimate of the time
                                               horizon for their retirement portfolio?

                                                 D. More than 20 years
                                               Answer: D. Time horizon does not end at retirement age. The portfolio will have to last
                                               them throughout their retirement until their death. On the basis of current life expectancy
                                               tables, the money will have to last them at least 20 years.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              On January 22, 2016, NASAA adopted a Model Rule to protect senior investors from
                                              exploitation. To date, we have heard nothing from students about this topic other
                                              than the general responsibility to act with high standards of conduct. As is the case
                                              with all new rules, check the Content Updates.


                                    Liquidity
                                    Some investors have a need for a certain sum, such as an upcoming home purchase or college
                                    tuition. Or they might just like the idea that they can get their money literally at a moment’s
                                    notice. They need liquid assets in their portfolio. A product is liquid if a customer can sell it
                                    quickly at face amount (or very close to it) or at a fair market price.

                                    Remember that a liquid investment does not mean you won’t lose money on your investment.
                                    It simply means you can get the current market value of the investment quickly. Liquid
                                    investments include:
                                     securities listed on an exchange or Nasdaq;
                                     mutual funds;
                                     exchange-traded funds; and
                                     most real estate investment trusts (REITs).

                                     annuities, when initially purchased and/or when the annuitant is under age 59½;
                                     real estate;
                                     securities purchased in a private placement;
                                     DPPs; and
                                     hedge funds.

                                         Taxes
                                         A client’s tax situation is often an important factor in determining suitable investments. For
                                         exam purposes, there are two ways to reduce taxes—tax deferral and tax-free income.


                                         Tax Deferral
                                         Contributions to an IRA, a qualified retirement plan, or a TSA may be tax deductible and
                                         are not taxed until withdrawn. This gives two benefits to the investor. First, the investments
                                         are made with pre-tax money. Second, there are no taxes on the income or growth until the
                                         money is paid out. That is the power of deferring taxes.


                                         Tax-Free Income
                                         Municipal bonds pay interest that is free from federal taxation. There are cases where the
                                         income would be taxed on the state level; that was covered in Unit 2. Municipal bonds
                                         generally pay interest at a lower rate than taxable bonds. That is because the interest is tax free.
                                         Depending on the investor’s tax bracket, the municipal bond may result in higher returns on
                                         an after-tax basis. As will be covered in Unit 18, it is also possible to generate tax-free income
                                         using a Roth IRA, a Coverdell ESA, and a Section 529 plan.


                                         Laws and Regulations
                                         An example of how laws or regulations could be an investment constraint is the case of the
                                         accredited investor. A registered representative may find the absolutely perfect investment to
                                         meet the client’s objectives only to find out the client can’t make the purchase because of lack
                                         of accredited investor status. Another case might be when the desired security is not registered
                                         for sale in the client’s state of residence. As we’ve learned, there are certain investments that
                                         are illegal or inappropriate for an IRA. That is what an investment constraint is all about: we’d
                                         like to buy this, but we can’t.


                                         Unique Circumstances and/or Preferences
                                         Investors share many common characteristics. When you speak to a customer about goals, you
                                         will notice how often the same ones keep coming up. That said, it is important to understand
                                         that these are all unique individuals with their own needs and wants. We’ll take a look at how
                                         some of those are investment constraints.

                                         The most common case on the exam is the desire to avoid investing in certain industries. The
                                         term ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investing has become more popular with
                                         each passing year. Those investors who have a strong feeling about environmental issues won’t
                                         invest in companies that are considered polluters or create other health issues. A test question
                                         might ask about an investor whose parent died of lung cancer. The question might say,
                                         “Which stock would be least likely to be attractive to this client?” You should select tobacco
                                         companies.

                                         Unique cases could be receiving a large inheritance or a multi-million-dollar lottery win.
                                         Objectives can change pretty quickly with those additional dollars. On the flip side, a
                                         client’s business going bankrupt will cause the registered representative to rethink some
                                         recommendations. An extended period of unemployment or serious illness can do the same.

                                    takes careful thought.

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   Which of the following is an investment constraint?
                                                    A. Retirement
                                                    B. Income
                                                    C. College education
                                                    D. Time horizon
                                                   Answer: D. One of the most important investment constraints is the investor’s time
                                                   horizon. If you start saving for retirement (a goal) at age 55, you don’t have much
                                                   time to accumulate funds. A short time horizon limits how aggressive the portfolio
                                                   can be. If you started at age 25, with that long a time horizon, there are many more
                                                   investment options available. Income is an objective, and college education is a goal.

                                                                                                                                                  Unit 17
                                                   That goal is also affected by time horizon. It is much better to start saving for college
                                                   when a child is very young. You don’t want to wait until the teenage years.

                                              1.   An individual with a very low risk tolerance would find which of the following to be
                                                   the most appropriate recommendation for meeting a specific goal in six years?

                                                    D. Commodity futures
                                              2.   A 66-year-old individual plans to retire in four years. At this time, savings include
                                                   $100,000 equity in the home, $45,000 in an IRA, and anticipated Social Security
                                                   payments of $1,560 per month. The individual would like to be able to travel
                                                   extensively, buy nice gifts for their grandchildren, and live in a nice retirement village.
                                                   Which of the following is the most likely investment constraint facing this individual?
                                                    A. Laws and regulations

                                    Because the highest percentage of stock market investing by “Main Street America” is in
                                    pooled investment vehicles (mutual funds, ETFs, and variable annuities), whether through
                                    direct investment or an employer-sponsored retirement plan such as a 401(k) or 403(b) plan,
                                    the exam tends to use these vehicles as proxies for meeting investor objectives.


                                    Mutual Fund Suitability
                                    Once a mutual fund or variable annuity subaccount defines its objective, its portfolio is
                                    invested to match it. The objective must be clearly stated in the fund’s prospectus and can be
                                    changed only by a majority vote of the fund’s outstanding shares.

                                         Stock Funds
                                         Common stocks normally provide the growth component of any mutual fund that has growth
                                         as a primary objective. Preferred, utility, and large-cap stocks are typically used to provide the
                                         income component of any stock mutual fund that has income as a primary objective.

                                         Although there are other categories (to be covered in Unit 21), at this point you need to know
                                         the difference between large-cap and small-cap stocks. The term “cap” refers to the company’s
                                         market capitalization (the number of outstanding common shares multiplied by the current
                                         market price per share). For example, a company with 30 million shares outstanding where
                                         the price per share is $30 has a market cap of $900 million. As you will see again in Unit 21,
                                         a market cap of $300 million to $2 billion is considered small-cap, while that of more than
                                         $10 billion is considered large-cap. It is generally felt that the larger the market cap, the more
                                         conservative the investment.


                                         Growth Funds
                                         Growth funds invest in stocks of rapidly growing corporations. Growth companies tend to
                                         reinvest all or most of their profits for research and development rather than pay dividends.
                                         Growth funds are focused on generating capital gains rather than income. Aggressive growth
                                         funds tend to concentrate more in small-cap stocks, while conservative growth funds have a
                                         preponderance of large-cap issues.


                                         Income Funds
                                         An income fund stresses current income over growth. The fund’s objective may be
                                         accomplished by investing in the stocks of companies with long histories of dividend
                                         payments, such as utility company stocks, large-cap stocks, and preferred stocks.


                                         Combination Funds
                                         A combination fund (also called a growth and income fund) may attempt to combine the
                                         objectives of growth and current income by diversifying its portfolio among companies
                                         showing long-term growth potential and companies paying high dividends.


                                         Specialized (Sector) Funds
                                         Many funds specialize in particular economic sectors or industries. Others specialize in
                                         geographic areas such as the BRIC countries or the Pacific Rim. The funds have 25–100%
                                         of their assets invested in their specialties and are more likely than other funds to stick to a
                                         relatively fixed allocation.

                                                    EXAMPLE
                                                    Gold funds (gold mining stocks), insurance funds (insurance company stocks),
                                                    technology funds, and utility funds are examples of sector funds. Sector funds offer
                                                    high appreciation potential but may also pose higher risks to the investor because of
                                                    their lack of diversification among industries or geographic areas.

                                    Special Situation Funds
                                    Special situation funds buy securities of companies that may benefit from a change within the
                                    corporations or in the economy. Takeover candidates and turnaround situations are common
                                    investments. These funds tend to be on the speculative side because the hoped-for takeover or
                                    turnaround might not happen.


                                    Index Funds
                                    Index funds invest in securities to mirror a market index, such as the S&P 500. An index
                                    fund buys and sells securities in a manner that mirrors the composition of the selected index.
                                    The fund’s performance tracks the underlying index’s performance. This approach reflects the
                                    passive style of portfolio management, as opposed to active portfolio management (more on
                                    those in Unit 21).


                                                                                                                                               Unit 17
                                    Turnover of securities in an index fund’s portfolio is minimal. As a result, an index fund
                                    generally has lower management costs than other types of funds. Furthermore, because index
                                    funds have little turnover, they frequently appeal to investors seeking minimal taxable capital
                                    gains. One concern with index investing is the presence of tracking error. Simply stated, some
                                    index funds do not do a good job of tracking the index. We’ll have more to say about that in
                                    Lesson 20.5.


                                    Foreign Stock Funds
                                    Foreign stock funds invest mostly in the securities of companies that have their principal
                                    business activities outside the United States. Long-term capital appreciation is their primary
                                    objective, although some funds also seek current income. Foreign investments involve foreign
                                    currency risks, as well as the usual risks associated with stock investments.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              There are two terms generally used to describe funds that invest in foreign securities.
                                               International funds have their entire portfolio invested in securities issued
                                                 outside of the United States. The way to remember that is if you will be traveling
                                                 internationally, you’ll be outside the United States.
                                               Global funds have the portfolio invested “around the globe,” and that includes
                                                 U.S. securities. Once again, using the travel example, if you were to travel around
                                                 the globe, a portion of your trip would be in the United States.


                                    Bond Funds
                                    Bond funds have income as their primary investment objective. Some funds invest solely in
                                    investment-grade corporate bonds. Others, for enhanced safety, invest only in government
                                    issues. Others seek maximum income by investing in lower-rated issues that entail greater risk
                                    but potentially higher returns.


                                    Tax-Free (Tax-Exempt) Bond Funds
                                    These funds invest in municipal bonds that produce income exempt from federal income tax.
                                    As a result, their income distributions are free from federal income tax to the investor. Some
                                    funds are double tax-free in that they are state-specific funds. That means the portfolio is
                                    100% bonds issued by a political subdivision of a single state that levies a personal income




17_0-2532_LEM_65E_Unit17.indd 417                                                                                                        28/10/22 3:01 PM

                                         tax. Therefore, the income is tax free on both state and federal income tax returns. Please note
                                         that any capital gains distributions from the fund are taxable, just as with any other fund.
                                         A key to remember for the exam is that municipal bonds or municipal bond funds are only
                                         suitable for those in higher tax brackets.


                                         U.S. Government and Agency Securities Funds
                                         U.S. government funds purchase securities issued by the U.S. Treasury or an agency of the
                                         U.S. government, such as Ginnie Mae. Investors in these funds seek current income and
                                         maximum safety.


                                         Foreign Bond Funds
                                         These funds invest in foreign sovereign and/or corporate debt issues. Although they carry the
                                         same general risks as investing directly into foreign debt, they tend to be reduced because of
                                         the professional management and diversification offered by fund investing.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                        If ABC Fund pays regular dividends, offers a high degree of safety of principal, and
                                                        appeals especially to investors in the higher tax brackets, ABC is
                                                          A. an aggressive growth fund.
                                                          B. a corporate bond fund.
                                                          C. a money market fund.
                                                          D. a municipal bond fund.
                                                        Answer: D. Municipal bonds are considered second only to U.S. government
                                                        securities in terms of safety. Furthermore, whenever you see a question about an
                                                        investor in a high tax bracket, always look for the answer choice with municipal
                                                        bonds; the tax-free income is the key. That is what makes choice D correct. On
                                                        the other hand, when you see growth, dividends will probably not be part of the
                                                        equation.


                                         Balanced Funds
                                         Balanced funds invest in stocks for appreciation and bonds for income. The exact mix is
                                         determined according to a formula used by the portfolio manager. These tend to be the most
                                         conservative of the stock funds.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   A balanced fund’s portfolio might contain 60% stocks and 40% bonds.


                                         Asset Allocation Funds
                                         Asset allocation funds split investments between stocks for growth, bonds for income,
                                         and money market instruments or cash for stability. Fund advisers switch the percentage of
                                         holdings in each asset category according to the performance (or expected performance) of
                                         that group. These funds can also hold hard assets, such as precious metals like gold and silver,
                                         and real estate.

                                         A fund may have 60% of its investments in stock, 20% in bonds, and the remaining 20% in
                                         cash. If the stock market is expected to do well, the adviser may switch from cash and bonds
                                         to stock. The result may be a portfolio of 80% in stock, 10% in bonds, and 10% in cash.

                                    Conversely, if the stock market is expected to decline, the fund may invest heavily in cash and
                                    sell stocks.

                                    Many asset allocation funds are target funds (see the following) that target a specific goal—
                                    such as retirement—in a 5-, 10-, 15-, or 20-year period. As the target year gets closer, the mix
                                    of investments becomes more conservative.

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              An investor seeks an investment for retirement in 20 years that performs well under
                                              most market conditions and is diversified by purchasing multiple types of securities.
                                              An asset allocation fund that targets the year of retirement may be appropriate.


                                    Target-Date Funds

                                                                                                                                             Unit 17
                                    One of the most popular investment options, especially in retirement plans, is a target-date
                                    fund. You might see the term lifecycle fund instead. According to a report by a large retirement
                                    plan provider, target-date funds are offered by nearly 90% of employer-sponsored defined
                                    contribution plans, such as 401(k) plans.

                                    Target-date funds are designed to help manage investment risk. This is done by selecting a
                                    fund with a target date in mind that is closest to the year an investor anticipates needing the
                                    money (i.e., retiring in 2030). For example, a 2030 fund gradually reduces risk by changing
                                    the investments within the fund to a more conservative mix as the target date approaches.
                                    That said, target-date funds are not risk free, even when the target date has been reached.
                                    These funds are sometimes called lifecycle funds, a reference to the term lifecycle we described
                                    in the previous LO.

                                    FINRA is concerned that many investors surveyed do not understand that target-date funds
                                    do not provide guaranteed income. Many investors also do not realize that similar-sounding
                                    funds may, in fact, have different investments and risk profiles.

                                    Like all investments, target-date funds can lose money if the stocks and bonds owned by the
                                    fund drop in value. And even though funds with identical target dates may look the same,
                                    they may have very different investment strategies and asset allocations that can affect how
                                    risky they are and what they are worth, at any given point in time, including when and after
                                    retirement takes place.


                                    Money Market Funds
                                    Money market funds are no-load, open-end investment companies (mutual funds) that
                                    serve as temporary holding accounts for investors’ money. As the name implies, the portfolio
                                    of a money market fund consists of money market securities. The term no-load means that
                                    investors pay no sales or liquidation fees. Money market mutual funds are most suitable for
                                    investors whose financial goals require liquidity above all.

                                    The interest these funds earn and distribute as dividends is computed daily and credited to
                                    customer accounts monthly. In general, money market mutual funds offer check-writing
                                    privileges, making for extraordinary liquidity.

                                    The NAV of money market funds is generally fixed at $1 per share. Although this price is not
                                    guaranteed, a fund is managed in order not to “break the buck” regardless of market changes.
                                    Thus, the price of money market shares does not fluctuate in response to changing interest
                                    rates.

                                         Restrictions on Money Market Funds
                                         SEC rules limit the investments available to money market funds and require certain
                                         disclosures to investors.

                                         Restrictions include the following:
                                          Investments are limited to securities with remaining maturities of 397 days or less, with
                                            average portfolio maturity not exceeding 60 days.
                                          Investments are limited to securities that have received a rating from a recognized rating
                                            agency in one of the two highest short-term rating categories.

                                                   PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                       An investor has a portfolio diversified among many different asset classes. If there
                                                       was an immediate need for cash, which of the following would probably be the most
                                                       liquid?
                                                         A. Cash value from a universal life insurance policy
                                                         B. CDL Common Stock Mutual Fund
                                                         C. QRS Money Market Mutual Fund
                                                         D. XYZ International Stock Mutual Fund
                                                       Answer: C. Money market funds generally come with a check-writing privilege,
                                                       offering investors the opportunity to convert the asset to cash at once. Although all
                                                       mutual funds are readily redeemable, under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
                                                       the fund has 7 days to redeem. One must request the cash value from the insurance
                                                       company and, in many cases, can take 30 days or longer.

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   Be aware that an investment in a money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by
                                                   the FDIC or any other government agency. Although a money market fund seeks to
                                                   preserve the value of the investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by
                                                   investing in a money market fund.


                                         Alternative Investments
                                         As described in Unit 5, there are a number of alternative pooled investments. The risks
                                         and rewards were covered there, but, as a refresher, in almost all cases, these are speculative
                                         investments and will only be suitable on that basis. For example, ETNs can provide attractive
                                         short-term returns based on the performance of the selected index, but with a number of
                                         risks pointed out earlier. Leveraged or inverse ETFs or funds can offer dynamic profits, but
                                         only for those with a very short time horizon and high appetite for risk. The following chart
                                         summarizes common investor objectives and appropriate recommendations. Be ready for a
                                         significant number of situational questions that require determining the best solution for the
                                         investor.

          1. A       It should be easy to eliminate one of the
                     choices immediately. Commodity futures are
                     for speculators, not conservative investors.
                     An income fund or a balance fund has
                     the problem of being subject to market
                     fluctuation. When the money needs to be
                     there in six years, if the market is in the
                     middle of a downturn, it is likely the funds
                     will be less than needed. The bank-insured CD
                     will never fluctuate and, with FDIC insurance,
                     is the safest bet.

          2. D With four years to go and $145,000 in
               claimed assets, there isn’t much time for them
               to grow to a level commensurate with the cash
               flow that will be needed for this individual’s
               goals. There is no liquidity problem with the
               IRA—this investor is past the 10% penalty
               age. There don’t appear to be any laws or
               regulations that would have an impact, and
               the income does not appear to be at a level
               where taxation is a primary concern.

             INTRODUCTION
                                    Retirement plans allow investors to accumulate resources to fund their retirement. Individuals
                                    accomplish this through business-sponsored retirement plans, personal plans, or individual and
                                    corporate retirement plans. To encourage Americans to save for retirement, Congress has passed
                                    legislation that allows investors to invest in certain retirement plans on a tax-deductible and/or
                                    tax-deferred basis.

                                    Throughout this unit, we give you the contribution limits for all plans described that are current
                                    for those filing 2021 tax returns. It is highly unlikely that any of those numbers, other than
                                    perhaps the IRA contribution limit, will be asked on the exam. Therefore, you should consider
                                    these as included for reference purposes, not for testing.

          LESSON 18.1: INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ARRANGEMENTS
                                        LO 18.a Recall the features of traditional, Roth, and simplified
                                        employee pension plan individual retirement accounts.

                                        As with so much in this course, there are similar terms with sometimes dissimilar meanings.
                                        Here is a useful list of terms used in the discussion of retirement plans:

                                        Tax-deferred: Simply, income tax is put off (deferred) to a later time. In most retirement
                                        plans, tax on the amount of the contribution is usually deferred until withdrawal. Tax on the
                                        earnings is always deferred until withdrawal.

                                        Qualified plan: An employer-sponsored plan, such as a pension, 401(k), or 403(b), where the
                                        contributions are made with pre-tax dollars and earnings in the account grow without any tax
                                        (tax-deferred) until the funds are withdrawn.

                                        Qualified: This term by itself means that contributions are made with pre-tax dollars, and
                                        earnings in the account are tax deferred until the funds are withdrawn. This can apply to
                                        either a qualified plan or an IRA.

                                        Nonqualified plan: An employer-sponsored plan, such as a deferred compensation plan,
                                        where there are no tax advantages other than that the payout is not received until sometime
                                        later when the individual should be in a lower tax bracket. Another advantage is that the
                                        employer can discriminate between employees. The term can also apply to an annuity
                                        purchased on an individual basis outside of a retirement plan, as will be described in Unit 24.

                                        Deductible contribution: The contribution made by the individual, whether an employee
                                        contribution to a qualified plan such as a 401(k) plan or by any individual to an IRA. This
                                        means the amount contributed is pre-tax or otherwise deductible on the tax return.

                                        Nondeductible contribution: A contribution to a qualified plan or an IRA that is made with
                                        after-tax dollars. The funds do grow tax deferred, but there is no tax benefit derived from the
                                        contribution.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    Although individual retirement arrangements is the technical IRS term (not tested),
                                                    because everyone refers to these as individual retirement accounts (IRAs), we’re going
                                                    to use the common phrase to avoid confusion.

                                        Individual retirement accounts (IRAs) were created to encourage people to save for their
                                        retirement. Most individuals with earned income can open and contribute to an IRA. Three
                                        types of IRAs are available, with different contribution, tax, and distribution characteristics:
                                        traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, and simplified employee pension plan (SEP) IRAs.

                                        IRAs are not to be confused with qualified plans or nonqualified plans used by businesses.
                                        Later in this unit we will cover topics such as pension plans, 401(k) plans, and deferred
                                        compensation plans. At this point, keep in mind that a qualified plan means that it meets the
                                        IRS requirements for the contributions to the plan to be tax deductible and the earnings to
                                        grow tax deferred. Nonqualified plans do not enjoy most of the tax benefits of qualified plans.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              Although we may include some actual contribution limits, it is unlikely that you will
                                              have to know any others than the IRA and Coverdell numbers.


                                    Traditional IRAs
                                    The first of the IRAs we’ll cover is generally referred to as the traditional IRA, although
                                    there is no such term in the IRS regulations. This was the first IRA, and as others have
                                    been introduced, this first one acquired its name. A traditional IRA allows a maximum
                                    tax-deductible annual contribution of the lesser of $6,000 per individual or $12,000 per
                                    couple, or 100% of taxable compensation for the taxable year 2021. The income and capital
                                    gains earned in the account are tax deferred until the funds are withdrawn.


                                    Compensation for IRA Purposes
                                    For purposes of contributing to an IRA, the IRS considers the following to be compensation:
                                     Wages, salaries, and tips
                                     Commissions and bonuses
                                     Self-employment income
                                     Alimony*
                                     Nontaxable combat pay



                                                                                                                                                  Unit 18
                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              *For divorce decrees signed prior to January 1, 2019, alimony is considered earned
                                              income to the recipient. That makes it eligible compensation for purposes of an IRA
                                              contribution.


                                    Not Compensation for IRA Purposes
                                    For purposes of contributing to an IRA, the IRS does not consider the following to be
                                    compensation:
                                     Capital gains
                                     Interest and dividend income
                                     Pension or annuity income
                                     Child support
                                     Alimony*
                                     Passive income from DPPs
                                    Although it is taxable, income from required minimum distributions (RMDs) is not
                                    compensation for the purposes of an IRA contribution.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              *For divorce decrees signed after December 31, 2018, under the TCJA of 2017, alimony
                                              payments are not considered compensation. Alimony is not deductible by the payer
                                              and is not taxable to the payee. If the date of the divorce decree is not given, assume it
                                              is post-2018 and is not compensation for IRA purposes.

                                        Catch-Up Contributions for Older IRA Owners
                                        The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (EGTRRA) was the
                                        source of the legislation permitting certain individuals to make additional contributions to
                                        their IRAs. Individuals aged 50 and older are allowed to make catch-up contributions to
                                        their IRAs above the scheduled maximum annual contribution limit, which will enable them

                                                    The exam may want you to know that the EGTRRA is responsible for the catch-up
                                                    provisions. Any taxpayer of any age who reports earned income for a given tax year
                                                    may contribute to a traditional IRA. If one spouse has little or no earned income
                                                    and a joint tax return is filed, a spousal IRA may be opened for that person and the
                                                    contribution limits are the same as for any other IRA.

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                         One member of a married couple in their 30s earns an annual salary of $45,000, while
                                                         the other earns $2,000 annually from a home-based business. If they file a joint tax
                                                         return, their maximum IRA contribution for the year is
                                                           A. $6,000.
                                                          B. $8,000.
                                                           C. $12,000.
                                                          D. $14,000.
                                                         Answer: C. When one spouse’s annual earnings are less than $6,000, the spousal IRA
                                                         benefit permits that spouse to contribute the maximum as long as a joint return is
                                                         filed showing combined income of at least $12,000. In this case, their income exceeds
                                                         that, so they can each have an IRA with a contribution of $6,000, making for a total of
                                                         $12,000 (choice C). Please note that when using the spousal IRA, the higher-earning
                                                         spouse cannot have more than the maximum contributed to their account (currently
                                                         $6,000). One can’t look at this and say the couple has $12,000 to be split however
                                                         they wish. If this question had stated the couple were in their 50s, then, because of
                                                         the catch-up provision, $14,000 would have been the correct choice.


                                        Time for Contributions
                                        IRA contributions for a specific taxable year may be made anytime from January 1 of that year
                                        through the required filing date of that year’s return (generally April 15 of the next year, unless
                                        the 15 falls on a holiday or weekend day). If the individual obtains a filing extension, the
                                        deadline is still April 15.

                                                    The exam may try to trick you into thinking that you can make a contribution later
                                                    than April 15 if you have received an extension to file your taxes. You can’t! You should
                                                    know that an extension does not give you more time to pay your taxes; it only extends
                                                    the time that you have to file your return.

                                    Excess Contributions
                                    Annual IRA contributions exceeding the maximum allowed are subject to a 6% penalty tax if
                                    the excess is not removed by the taxpayer in a timely manner.


                                    Roth IRAs
                                    Much of what has been stated about the traditional IRA applies to the Roth IRA—what
                                    is important are the differences. The most significant difference relates to the taxation of
                                    contributions and withdrawals. Contributions to Roth IRAs, unlike those of traditional IRAs,
                                    are not tax deductible. And earnings are not merely tax deferred; they can be tax free.

                                    Earnings accumulated may be withdrawn tax-free, five years following the initial deposit,
                                    provided:
                                     the account holder is 59½ or older;
                                     the money withdrawn is used for the first-time purchase of a principal residence (up to
                                       $10,000); or
                                     the account holder has died or become disabled.
                                    Regular contributions may always be withdrawn tax-free because they are made with
                                    nondeductible contributions.

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  Among the requirements for accumulated earnings in a Roth IRA to be withdrawn

                                                                                                                                                  Unit 18
                                                  free of tax is
                                                    A. the owner of the account is at least 72 years old.
                                                    B. the money is withdrawn for a first-time purchase of a vacation home.
                                                    C. the initial deposit to a Roth IRA was made at least 5 years ago.
                                                    D. the owner’s spouse is declared disabled.
                                                  Answer: C. The first requirement for tax-free withdrawals from a Roth IRA is that
                                                  the initial deposit to a Roth must have been made at least 5 years ago (choice C).
                                                  The other primary requirement is that the owner must be at least 59½, not 72. If the
                                                  5-year requirement is met, then owners under 59½ can receive tax-free distributions
                                                  of accumulated earnings they wish to use, up to $10,000, for a first-time purchase of
                                                  a primary residence, not a vacation home. The disability requirement only applies to
                                                  the owner of the Roth, not a spouse.


                                    Contribution Limits
                                    Contribution limits to Roth IRAs are the same as those for traditional IRAs. Like a traditional
                                    IRA, contributions may be made at any age as long as the taxpayer has earned income.

                                    An individual may contribute to both a traditional and a Roth IRA. However, the maximum
                                    combined contribution is $6,000 (or $7,000, if 50 or older).


                                    Eligibility Requirements
                                    Unlike the traditional IRA, there are limits placed on Roth eligibility based on income.
                                    Anyone with earned income is eligible to open a Roth IRA, provided the person’s adjusted
                                    gross income (AGI) falls below specified income levels. The following numbers (which are
                                    never tested) are effective for those filing a tax return for 2021. A single person with an

                                        AGI of less than $125,000 may contribute the full amount to a Roth IRA. The ability to
                                        contribute to a Roth IRA is gradually phased out if the taxpayer’s AGI is between $125,000
                                        and $140,000.

                                        For married taxpayers who file joint tax returns, the AGI limit is $198,000, with the
                                        contribution phased out for couples whose income is between $198,000 and $208,000.


                                        Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)
                                        Adjusted gross income, generally referred to as AGI, is computed on the bottom of the first
                                        page of Form 1040. It might help you to take a look at yours. When you do your taxes, you
                                        begin by listing all of your earned income (salary, wages, and bonuses) plus other income such
                                        as interest and dividends, capital gains, alimony received, and profits from a business you may
                                        own. From that total, you deduct certain items to arrive at the AGI. Among the more testable
                                        items that are deductible are:
                                         traditional IRA contributions;
                                         alimony paid as part of a pre-January 1, 2019, divorce decree;
                                         self-employment tax; and
                                         penalties paid on early withdrawal from a savings account.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    Please note that although tax-exempt income from municipal securities is shown on
                                                    Form 1040, it is not included in AGI.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    These eligibility numbers will not be tested because they change every year. It is the
                                                    concept that is important.


                                        Roth Conversions
                                        Anyone with a traditional IRA is permitted to convert it to a Roth IRA. However, there are
                                        income tax consequences. Basically, the entire amount converted is added to the investor’s
                                        ordinary income. As long as the funds are moved in a direct rollover trustee to trustee,
                                        or, if distributed to the owner, are rolled over within 60 days, there will be no 10% early
                                        distribution tax penalty for those under age 59½. If some portion of the contributions to
                                        the traditional IRA were made with after-tax money, the IRS uses a proportionate system
                                        to determine how much is nontaxable, but that type of computation will not be tested.
                                        Conversions may also be done from any qualified employer plan such as 401(k) and 403(b)
                                        plans, as well as SIMPLE and SEP IRAs.

                                         Distributions are tax free if taken after age 59½ and a Roth account has been open for at
                                           least five years.
                                         Contributions can be made at any age as long as there is earned income.
                                         Distributions are not required to begin at age 72.

                                    partnerships, REITs, U.S. government securities, or gold or silver coins minted by the
                                    U.S. Treasury Department (American Eagles), as well as certain platinum coins and bullion
                                    (gold, silver, palladium, and platinum), annuities, and many other investments.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              The list of allowable coins goes beyond those minted by the Treasury. We have never
                                              heard of any of these asked on the exam, but the more those TV commercials rave
                                              about gold in your IRA, the greater the chance NASAA will start asking. In addition to
                                              the American Eagles, the IRS will permit the following coins:
                                                 American Buffalo
                                                 Canadian Gold Maple Leaf
                                                 Australian Gold Nugget
                                                 Platinum Maple Leafs and nonproof coins
                                              IRA investments should be relatively conservative and should reflect the investor’s age
                                              and risk tolerance profile. Because an IRA serves as a source of retirement funds, it is

                                                                                                                                                  Unit 18
                                              important that the account be managed for adequate long-term growth.


                                    Ineligible and Inappropriate Investments
                                    Collectibles, including antiques, gems, rare coins, works of art, and stamps, are not acceptable
                                    IRA investments. Life insurance contracts (such as whole life and term) may not be purchased
                                    in an IRA. Tax-free municipal bonds, municipal bond funds, and municipal bond UITs are
                                    eligible, but they are generally considered inappropriate for an IRA (or any tax-qualified
                                    plan) because their yields are typically lower than those of other similar investments, and the
                                    income generated is taxable on withdrawal from the IRA.


                                    Ineligible Investment Practices
                                    No short sales of stock, trading on margin (covered in detail in Unit 23), or speculative option
                                    strategies (think uncoveredcalls) is permitted in an IRA or any other retirement plan. Covered
                                    call writing, described in Unit 4, is allowed.

                                    Real Estate in an IRA (or Qualified Plan)
                                    Legally, you may invest in real estate in your IRA or as a participant in a 401(k) or any other
                                    qualified plan. It is not commonly something that is written into the documents, but it

                                        could be. Probably the biggest reason why the provision is rarely found is because of the extra
                                        care that must be taken when making a real estate investment. If done improperly, serious
                                        problems with the IRS can result. If it is done as a truly hands-off investment, it is unlikely
                                        that there will be an issue. However, the moment the participant derives any personal benefit
                                        from the property—such as staying in a condo purchased in a resort area that is rented out
                                        most of the year, or allowing prohibited persons to use the property—look out.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    The IRS defines prohibited persons (people who can’t benefit from real estate held
                                                    in an IRA or qualified plan) as any “member of the family.” Who are they? A member
                                                    of the family includes a spouse, ancestors (parents and grandparents), children,
                                                    grandchildren, great-grandchildren, and spouses of children, grandchildren, and
                                                    great-grandchildren. Believe it or not, for the purpose of this rule, a brother or sister
                                                    of an individual is not a member of the family, while a legally adopted child of an
                                                    individual is treated as a child by blood.


                                        Simplified Employee Pension Plans (SEP IRAs)
                                        The third type of IRA is somewhat different in that it is funded by an employer rather than
                                        the individual. Simplified employee pension plans (SEPs) offer self-employed persons and
                                        small businesses easy-to-administer pension plans. A SEP is a qualified plan that allows an
                                        employer to contribute money directly to an individual retirement account (IRA) set up for
                                        each employee; hence the name SEP IRA. Following is a list of the key points of which to be
                                        aware:

                                        Eligibility. To be eligible, an employee must be at least 21 years of age, have performed
                                        services for the employer during at least three of the last five years, and have received at
                                        least $650 (for 2021) in compensation from the employer in the current year (the annual
                                        compensation figure is indexed for inflation).

                                        Participation. SEP rules require the employer to allow all eligible employees to participate.

                                        Funding. A SEP allows the employer to contribute up to 25% of an employee’s salary to the
                                        employee’s SEP IRA each year, up to a maximum of $58,000 per employee per year in 2021.
                                        The employer determines the level of contributions each year and must contribute the same
                                        percentage for each employee, as well as the employer.

                                        Catch-up provision. Unlike the IRA and most qualified plans, there is NO catch-up
                                        provision for a SEP. However (and this is unlikely to be tested), if the SEP IRA permits
                                        non-SEP contributions, they can make regular IRA contributions (including IRA catch-up
                                        contributions if they are age 50 and older) to the SEP IRA, up to the maximum annual limit.

                                        Vesting. Participants in a SEP IRA are fully vested immediately, meaning that once the money
                                        is deposited in an employee’s SEP IRA, it belongs to the employee.

                                        Taxation. Employer contributions are tax deductible to the employer. Contributions are not
                                        taxable to an employee until withdrawn, and earnings in the account accumulate tax deferred.

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   SEP IRAs
                                                    A. are used primarily by large corporations.
                                                    B. are used primarily by small businesses.
                                                    C. are set up by nonemployees.
                                                    D. cannot be set up by self-employed persons.
                                                   Answer: B. Small businesses and self-employed persons typically establish SEP IRAs
                                                   because they are easier and less expensive than other plans for an employer to set
                                                   up and administer.

             LESSON 18.2: IRA TAXATION
                                    LO 18.b Recognize the tax treatment of distributions from IRAs.


                                    Withdrawals from Traditional IRAs and SEP IRAs
                                    Up until this point, we’ve discussed contributions to IRAs; now let’s look at taking the money
                                    out. When it comes to traditional IRAs and SEP IRAs, distributions without penalty may
                                    begin after age 59½ and must begin by April 1 of the year following the year an individual
                                    turns 72. Distributions before age 59½ may be subject to a tax penalty, and withdrawals less
                                    than the required minimum distributions (RMDs) after age 72 may also incur tax penalties.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              When is the deadline for receiving an RMD from an IRA? An account owner must take
                                              the first RMD for the year in which the account owner turns 72. However, the first
                                              RMD payment can be delayed until April 1 of the year following the year in which the
                                              account owner turns 72. For all subsequent years, including the year in which the first
                                              RMD was paid by April 1, the account owner must take the RMD by December 31 of the
                                              year.

                                        To the extent withdrawals are from tax-deductible contributions, they are taxable as ordinary
                                        income. When there are both deductible and nondeductible contributions, a formula is used
                                        whereby a portion of the withdrawal represents a nontaxable return of principal.

                                        Taxable withdrawals before age 59½ are also subject to a 10% early withdrawal penalty unless
                                        they are due to:
                                         death;
                                         disability;
                                         first-time purchase of a primary residence ($10,000 lifetime maximum);
                                         qualified higher education expenses for immediate family members (including
                                           grandchildren, but not nieces or nephews);
                                         certain medical expenses;
                                         up to $5,000 during the first year after a child is born; or
                                         up to $5,000 during the first year after an eligible person is adopted.
                                           –– “Eligible adoptee” means anybody under age 18 or who is physically or mentally
                                               incapable of self-support regardless of age.
                                            –– If married, each spouse can make the $5,000 penalty-free withdrawal.
                                            –– These qualified birth or adoption distributions (QBOADs) are also available for
                                               qualified plans, but only if the sponsor provides for them.

                                        These exceptions also apply in the case of a nonqualified (taxable) distribution from a Roth
                                        IRA.

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                         Who of the following will not incur a penalty on an IRA withdrawal?
                                                          A. Man who has just become totally disabled
                                                          B. Woman who turned 59 a month before the withdrawal
                                                          C. Woman, age 50, who decides on early retirement
                                                          D. Man in his early 40s who uses the money to buy a second home
                                                         Answer: A. Early withdrawals, without penalty, are permitted only in certain
                                                         situations (such as death or qualifying disability).


                                        As stated, withdrawals must begin by April 1 of the year following the year in which the
                                        account owner reaches age 72, and they must meet minimum Internal Revenue Code
                                        (IRC) distribution requirements or incur a 50% penalty on the amounts falling short of the
                                        minimum required distribution (MRD).

                                        One important respect in which the Roth IRA differs from other retirement plans is that
                                        the age 72 is irrelevant. There are no required minimum distributions. An account holder
                                        reaching 72 who does not need the money and who is in good health could let the money
                                        continue to grow tax-free for decades.

                                        There is one other way to tap your IRA before age 59½ without penalty—through the
                                        substantially equal periodic payment (SEPP) exception. The substantially equal periodic
                                        payment exception under IRS rule 72(t) states that if you receive IRA payments at least
                                        annually based on your life expectancy (or the joint life expectancies of you and your
                                        beneficiary), the withdrawals are not subject to the 10% penalty. The IRS has tables for
                                        determining the appropriate amount of each payment at any given age.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              For exam purposes, other than with a Roth IRA, you can postpone beginning
                                              distributions until the later of:
                                               April 1 of the calendar year after you turn age 72; or
                                               April 1 of the calendar year following your retirement (but only for qualified plans,
                                                 not an IRA).

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              An IRA owner who reaches age 72 on January 1, 2021, must begin withdrawals by April
                                              1, 2022. However, if this individual is covered by an employer-sponsored plan other
                                              than a SEP IRA, there are no RMDs from that plan (but there are from any traditional
                                              IRAs) until after retirement.


                                    Nondeductible Capital Withdrawals
                                    IRA investors who contribute after-tax dollars to an IRA are not taxed on those funds when
                                    they are withdrawn from the account, but taxpayers are taxed at the ordinary income tax rate
                                    when they withdraw funds resulting from investment gains or income. As stated above, if the
                                    client is in the middle part of the phase-out range resulting in some of the contribution being
                                    pre-tax (deductible) and the rest post-tax, the IRS has a formula to determine how much of
                                    the money withdrawn is nontaxable.

                                              EXAMPLE

                                                                                                                                                  Unit 18
                                              A client has invested $25,000 in after-tax dollars in an IRA currently worth $75,000. If
                                              the client were to withdraw $75,000, only $50,000 would be taxable.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              The early withdrawal penalties for all IRAs are waived in the event of death or
                                              disability.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              Assume questions are about traditional IRAs unless they specifically state otherwise.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              Income and capital gains earned from investments in any IRA account are not taxed
                                              until the funds are withdrawn and, if a qualified withdrawal, are not taxed at all in the
                                              case of a Roth.

                                    Individuals may move their funds and investments from one IRA to another IRA through one
                                    of two methods:
                                     60-day rollover; or
                                     trustee to trustee transfer.

                                        60-Day Rollovers
                                        If you just see “IRA rollover,” it will be the 60-day rollover. An IRA account owner may
                                        take temporary possession of the account funds to move the retirement account to another
                                        custodian. The account owner may do so only once per 12-month period, and the rollover
                                        must be completed within 60 calendar days of the fund’s withdrawal from the original plan.
                                        However, 100% of the withdrawn amount must be rolled into the new account, or the
                                        unrolled balance will be subject to income tax and, if applicable, early withdrawal penalty.

                                        A participant in a business-sponsored qualified plan may move her plan assets to an IRA if
                                        she leaves the company and elects to take a lump-sum distribution. If the participant does
                                        take possession of the funds, she must complete the rollover within 60 calendar days of
                                        withdrawing the funds from the qualified plan.

                                        When the participant takes possession of the funds from a qualified plan to make a rollover,
                                        the payor of the distribution must, by law, withhold 20% of the distribution as a withholding
                                        tax. The participant must, nonetheless, roll over 100% of the plan distribution, including the
                                        funds withheld, or be subject to income tax and, if applicable, early withdrawal penalty.

                                                    EXAMPLE
                                                    A 50-year-old individual with $100,000 in her company retirement plan changes
                                                    employers. Her pension plan may be distributed to her in a lump-sum payment,
                                                    minus the mandatory 20% withholding of $20,000. She must then deposit $100,000
                                                    in an IRA rollover account within 60 days. Any portion not rolled over, including the
                                                    $20,000 withheld, is considered a distribution subject to ordinary income tax and early
                                                    distribution penalty. If she deposits the entire $100,000 into the IRA, she will apply on
                                                    her next income tax return for a refund of the $20,000 withheld.


                                        Trustee to Trustee Transfers
                                        Sometimes simply referred to as an IRA transfer, this is when account assets are sent directly
                                        from one IRA custodian to another, and the account owner never takes possession of the
                                        funds. Unlike the one per 12 months with an IRA rollover, the number of IRA transfers an
                                        account owner may make per year is unlimited. Direct rollovers and transfers generally make
                                        better sense than 60-day rollovers because the 20% federal tax withholding does not apply
                                        to direct transfers of portfolios and, because the transfer is basically immediate, the holder
                                        doesn’t have to be concerned about meeting the 60-day requirement.

                                        There is another way of receiving funds in an IRA, and that is when moving funds from an
                                        employer-sponsored qualified plan—that is the direct rollover.


                                        Direct Rollovers from Retirement Plans to IRAs
                                        A direct rollover is a distribution from an employer-sponsored retirement plan to an IRA,
                                        either traditional or Roth. When you terminate employment (or retire), you have the option
                                        of moving your employer-sponsored plan assets to an IRA. In some cases, if you go to a new
                                        job, your new employer’s plan may permit a direct rollover into that plan. The key to a direct
                                        rollover is that the money is never seen by the employee and moves directly from the current
                                        plan administrator directly to another administrator.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              How does a direct rollover differ from a transfer? A direct rollover is different from a
                                              transfer because it involves two different types of plans. For example, one would use a
                                              direct rollover to move funds from a 401(k) plan to an IRA, while the transfer is from an
                                              IRA at one brokerage firm to an IRA at another.


                                    Earnings Limitations for Tax Benefits
                                    Traditional and certain SEP IRA participants may deduct contributions to their IRAs from
                                    their taxable income. The deductibility limits are reduced or even eliminated for individuals
                                    who are covered by other employer-sponsored qualified plans.

                                    These AGI limits increase every year and will not be tested. Individuals who do not participate
                                    in qualified plans may deduct IRA contributions regardless of income level.

                                    For those filing 2021 tax returns, the IRA deductibility phase-out range is expressed in the

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              The limits are higher ($198,000–$208,000) if only one of the spouses participates in a

                                                                                                                                                  Unit 18
                                              qualified plan, but, as with all of these numbers, it is only the concept that is tested,
                                              never the numbers themselves.

                                    These limits deal only with the deductibility of contributions. If your client earns in excess
                                    of the limits, the full contribution can still be made, but none of it can be deducted. The test
                                    refers to those as post-tax or after-tax contributions. The earnings still grow tax deferred.

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              Two persons who are part of a married couple, each of whom does not participate in
                                              a qualified plan and whose combined income is $200,000, may contribute and deduct
                                              a total of $12,000 ($14,000 if both individuals are 50 or older). No deduction is allowed
                                              for a married couple where both are covered by a qualified plan and whose combined
                                              income is $125,000 (for 2021) or more. Nevertheless, their contributions are permitted,
                                              and all earnings are tax deferred.


                                    Inheriting an IRA
                                    The rules on the treatment of an inherited IRA depend on whether the beneficiary is the
                                    spouse or is some other relative (or nonrelative) of the deceased. Another factor is if the
                                    deceased had already begun taking RMDs. This issue is very technical, and we will only cover
                                    points that might be tested.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              IRAs and employer-sponsored qualified plans have a beneficiary designation. That
                                              designation supersedes any contrary provision in a will.

                                        Spousal Beneficiary
                                        When the beneficiary is the spouse, there are two choices that can be made:
                                         Do a spousal rollover, meaning the amount of the inheritance is rolled over into the
                                           spouse’s own IRA
                                         Continue to own the IRA as the beneficiary
                                        When doing a spousal rollover, this is treated, logically, as your own with all of the normal
                                        rules applying (withdrawal ages, RMDs, and so forth). That means that if the spouse is
                                        younger than 59½, any distributions prior to then will be subject to the 10% penalty (unless
                                        meeting one of the exceptions).

                                        If, however, the spouse elects to continue the account as the beneficiary, then there is no 10%
                                        penalty for withdrawals prior to age 59½. That’s the good news. The bad news is that RMDs
                                        (from a traditional IRA or SEP IRA) must begin when the deceased would have had to take
                                        them, a disappointment if the survivor is the younger partner. However, the RMDs will be
                                        computed based on the beneficiary’s age, not that of the deceased. Also, if it is a Roth IRA and
                                        the account hasn’t been open for at least five years, any withdrawal of earnings will be subject
                                        to income tax but not the 10% penalty.


                                        Nonspouse Beneficiary
                                        Things are different when the person inheriting a traditional IRA is not the spouse of the
                                        deceased. For one thing, unlike the spouse, the beneficiary will not be allowed to rollover the
                                        inherited IRA into their own IRA—this is simply not an option. In general, there are two
                                        primary options available.
                                         Take the cash now:​The nonspouse IRA beneficiary can withdraw 100% of the IRA
                                           account immediately. If this option is chosen, then 100% of the amount withdrawn
                                           (assuming the IRA was funded completely with pre-tax contributions) will be included in
                                           taxable income during the year of withdrawal.
                                         Cash out the IRA in 10 years: Unless qualifying for one of the exceptions listed below,
                                           withdrawal requirements depend on the age of the deceased. If the deceased owner of the
                                           IRA had reached the date where RMDs are required, then the beneficiary would need to
                                           take RMDs (based on that beneficiary’s age) from the inherited IRA for each of the first
                                           nine years, and then, in the tenth year, withdraw any remaining balance. If, on the other
                                           hand, the deceased had not yet reached 72, then the IRS does not require the payments
                                           to be made with any designated frequency. That is, you can take a portion the first year
                                           because you can use some cash, nothing for the next eight years, and the balance no later
                                           than December 31 of the tenth year.

                                        There are exceptions to the 10-year rule as follows:
                                         The surviving spouse (as described above)
                                         A minor child (10-year rule applies once the minor reaches the age of majority)
                                         A disabled individual
                                         A chronically ill individual
                                         An individual who is not more than 10 years younger than the deceased participant or
                                           IRA owner

                                        If the beneficiary does nothing by December 31 of the year following the year of death, the
                                        default option used by the IRA is the 10-year withdrawal option.

                                               PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   Grandma Abigail died at age 82 with a traditional IRA valued at $100,000. Her
                                                   daughter Betsy, 53 years old, was the sole beneficiary. Betsy’s choices would include
                                                    A. rolling over this IRA to her own IRA.
                                                    B. taking distributions over a period not to exceed 10 years.
                                                    C. taking the cash by December 31 and paying the 10% tax penalty because she is
                                                        under 59½.
                                                    D. leave the IRA in the name of the deceased and continue with the RMDs.
                                                   Answer: B. Among the options available to a nonspouse beneficiary is receiving the
                                                   payout over a 10-year period. The distributions may be taken as desired but must be
                                                   completed within 10 years. Betsy, being a daughter and not a spouse, could not roll
                                                   over the IRA into her own IRA. Even though she is under 59½, inheritors of IRAs do not
                                                   incur the 10% penalty tax on withdrawals.


                                               TAKE NOTE
                                               Just as with the spouse continuing the IRA as the beneficiary, if the account were
                                               a Roth IRA and had not been opened for the five-year minimum, any earnings
                                               distributed will be subject to ordinary income tax but not the 10% penalty.


                                    Disclaiming an IRA
                                    Believe it or not, there are actually people who inherit IRAs who don’t want the money. There
                                    are any number of reasons why (none of which will be tested), but what will be tested is what
                                    happens when the beneficiary disclaims the proceeds.

                                                                                                                                                   Unit 18
                                    A disclaimer is a refusal to accept a gift or inheritance. Perhaps it is easier to understand it like
                                    this: If you accept an item left to you by someone who has died, you are claiming that asset; if
                                    you refuse it, you are disclaiming it. In order for the disclaimer to be effective, it must be done
                                    within nine months of death, it must be in writing, and, of course, you cannot have taken any
                                    of the money.

                                    If the named beneficiary of an IRA disclaims all or part of the inherited IRA, the disclaimer
                                    has the effect of changing the beneficiary of the retirement plan. In general, the assets pass to
                                    the contingent beneficiary(ies). What if no contingent beneficiary has been named? Unless
                                    the IRA adoption document provides for it, the person disclaiming cannot decide where the
                                    money goes—it will follow the provisions of the deceased’s will.

                                               EXAMPLE
                                               Joseph Miller passes away at the age of 72 and leaves his wife, Josephine, his
                                               traditional IRA with a value of $1,800,000. There are many other assets in the estate,
                                               and Mrs. Miller decides to disclaim the entire IRA. She would like to pass on the assets
                                               to her three grandchildren, none of whom are minors, in equal shares, with another
                                               share going to her favorite charity. Assuming the IRA adoption document permits
                                               the beneficiary to designate in this matter, the charity will receive $450,000 with no
                                               tax liability at all, and the three grandchildren will each receive $450,000 on which
                                               distributions may be stretched out over a maximum of 10 years.

                                                    2.   A taxpayer opened a Roth IRA seven years ago. Last year, the individual opened a
                                                         new Roth IRA at your brokerage firm. The individual is 60 years of age and liquidates
                                                         $3,000 from the new Roth IRA. $1,000 of the withdrawal represents earnings in the
                                                         account. The tax consequence of this withdrawal is
                                                          A. no tax is due.
                                                          B. tax is due on the $1,000 from earnings.
                                                          C. tax plus the 10% penalty is due on the $1,000 from earnings.
                                                          D. tax is due on the entire $3,000 withdrawal.


          LESSON 18.3: EMPLOYER-SPONSORED RETIREMENT PLANS
                                        LO 18.c Differentiate between the different types of
                                        employer-sponsored qualified retirement plans.

                                        In this lesson, we will be describing the various retirement plans offered by employers to
                                        their employees. We will be addressing plans offered for the self-employed, the different
                                        plans offered by corporations, and, finally, plans designed for employees of tax-exempt
                                        organizations.


                                        Keogh Plans
                                        Keogh plans, technically called H.R. 10 plans and named after the Congressman who
                                        introduced the bill, are qualified plans intended for self-employed individuals and
                                        owner-employees of unincorporated business concerns or professional practices. Included in
                                        the self-employed category are independent contractors, consultants, freelancers, and anyone
                                        else who files and pays self-employment Social Security taxes. The term owner-employee refers
                                        to sole proprietors. A corporation cannot use a Keogh plan.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    Whenever the term qualified plan is used, it refers specifically to an
                                                    employer-sponsored plan, such as a 401(k) plan, a pension plan, or a Keogh plan, not
                                                    an IRA.

                                    Contributions
                                    Contribution limits for a Keogh plan are significantly higher than those for an IRA. For
                                    those filing tax returns in 2021, as much as $58,000 may be contributed on behalf of a
                                    plan participant. Those who are eligible for a Keogh plan may also maintain an IRA, but,
                                    as described previously, if the earning limits are exceeded, the IRA contribution will not be
                                    deductible. If the business has employees, they must be covered at the same contribution
                                    percentage as the owner in order for the plan to be nondiscriminatory.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              Only earnings from self-employment count toward determining the maximum that
                                              may be contributed. For example, if a corporate employee had a part-time consulting
                                              job, only that income, not the corporate salary, could be included in the computation.


                                    Eligibility
                                    Employee participation in a Keogh plan is subject to these eligibility rules:
                                     Full-time employees are employees who receive compensation for at least 1,000 hours of
                                       work per year.
                                     Tenured employees are employees who have completed one or more years of continuous
                                       employment.
                                     Adult employees are employees 21 years of age and older, and there is no age limit as
                                       long as the individual is employed.


                                    Comparison of IRAs and Keogh Plans                                                                            Unit 18
                                    Keogh plans and IRAs are designed to encourage individuals to set aside funds for retirement
                                    income. Although both IRAs and Keoghs are tax advantaged, an IRA does not involve
                                    employer contributions and, thus, is not a plan qualified by ERISA. The principal similarities
                                    between Keoghs and IRAs are listed in the following:
                                     Tax deferral of contributions to plans. Taxes are deferred on contributions until the
                                       individual receives distributions.
                                     Tax sheltered income. Investment income and capital gains are not taxed until
                                       withdrawn, at which time they are subject to taxation at ordinary income rates.
                                     Contributions. Only cash may be contributed to a plan. In the event of a rollover or
                                       transfer, cash and securities from the transferring account can be deposited.
                                     Distributions. Distributions without penalty can begin as early as age 59½.
                                     Penalties for early withdrawal. The individual pays income tax on the total amount
                                       withdrawn plus a 10% penalty. Early withdrawals without penalty are permitted in the
                                       event of death or disability.
                                     Payout options. Distributions may be in a lump sum or periodic payments.
                                     Beneficiary. Upon the plan holder’s death, payments are made to a designated beneficiary
                                       (or beneficiaries).

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                         Which of the following may participate in a Keogh plan?
                                                            I. Self-employed doctor
                                                           II. Analyst who makes money giving speeches outside regular working hours
                                                          III. Individual with a full-time job who also has income from freelancing
                                                          IV. Corporate executive who receives $5,000 in stock options from her corporation
                                                           A. I only
                                                           B. I and II
                                                           C. I, II, and III
                                                           D. I, II, III, and IV
                                                         Answer: C. A person with self-employment income may deduct contributions to a
                                                         Keogh plan. Keogh plans are not available to corporations or their employees. That
                                                         would make choice C the correct answer.


                                        Corporate Sponsored Retirement Plans
                                        Plans offered by corporations include pension plans, profit-sharing plans, and the highly
                                        popular 401(k) plans.

                                        The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) is federal legislation that
                                        regulates the establishment and management of corporate pension or retirement plans, also
                                        known as private sector plans.

                                        All qualified corporate plans must be established under a trust agreement. A trustee is
                                        appointed for each plan and has a fiduciary responsibility for the plan and the beneficial
                                        owners (the plan holders). We’ll cover ERISA in greater detail later in this unit in Lesson 18.5.


                                        Defined Contribution and Defined Benefit Plans
                                        All qualified retirement plans fall into one of two categories. Those that offer no specific end result
                                        but instead focus on current, tax-deductible contributions are defined contribution plans. Those
                                        that promise a specific retirement benefit but do not specify the level of current contributions are
                                        defined benefit plans. It is important to distinguish between these two approaches.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    Although we will be including 2021 contribution limits, these are never tested on the
                                                    exam because they change each year. As stated earlier in the course, they are simply to
                                                    give students an idea of the difference between the amount that may be contributed here
                                                    compared to an IRA.

                                        Defined Contribution Plans. Defined contribution plans include money-purchase pension
                                        plans as well as profit-sharing plans and 401(k) plans. As with other business plans (as
                                        compared to an IRA), the maximum employer contribution is currently (2021) $58,000.

                                        Defined contribution plan participants’ funds accumulate until a future event, generally
                                        retirement, when the funds may be withdrawn. The ultimate account value depends on the
                                        total amount contributed, along with interest and capital gains from the plan investments.
                                        In this type of plan, the plan participant assumes the investment risk. The deduction for
                                        contributions to a defined contribution plan, such as a profit-sharing plan (including 401(k))
                                        or money purchase pension plan, cannot be more than 25% of the total payroll for the year to
                                        the eligible employees participating in the plan.

                                    Defined Benefit Plans. Defined benefit plans are designed to provide specific retirement
                                    benefits for participants, such as fixed monthly income. Regardless of investment
                                    performance, the promised benefit is paid under the contract terms. A defined benefit plan
                                    sponsor assumes the investment risk. It can happen that the portfolio performance is so good
                                    that, in certain years, the plan is fully funded without a contribution needed for that year.

                                    The benefit is usually determined by a formula that takes into account years of service and
                                    average salary for the last five years prior to retirement. Older, highly compensated employees
                                    are likely to have the largest annual contributions on their behalf. Because of the expenses and
                                    complexities involved (the plan’s annual return must be signed by an actuary), 16% of workers
                                    had defined benefit plans in 2019, whereas in 1979, that number was 28%.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              Because of the actuarial assumptions and computations, the amount of the annual
                                              employer contribution has to be figured by an actuary. When the proper amount
                                              has been contributed, the plan is considered to be fully funded. If the year’s portfolio
                                              performance exceeds the actuarial assumptions, the plan is over-funded and a smaller or
                                              possibly no contribution is necessary for the year. Unfortunately, many plans, including
                                              state employee plans, are under-funded.

                                    Contributory versus noncontributory plans. In a contributory plan, both the employer and
                                    employee make contributions to the account. In a noncontributory plan, only the employer
                                    makes the contributions. Probably the most common example of a contributory plan is the
                                    401(k) plan, where the employee determines how much to contribute and the employer may

                                                                                                                                                  Unit 18
                                    match up to a certain percentage.

                                    Employer Deductions. The employer can usually deduct, subject to limits, contributions
                                    made to a qualified plan. The deduction limit for those contributions to a qualified plan
                                    depends on the kind of plan in place.

                                              Unlike an annuity payout or life insurance premium, contributions to a defined benefit

                                              Employer contributions to defined benefit or defined contribution, (money purchase),
                                              pension plans are mandatory. Although profit profit-sharing plans and 401(k) plans
                                              are technically defined contribution plans, they are not pension plans, and employer
                                              contributions are not mandatory. In all cases, allowable employer contributions are
                                              100% deductible to the corporation. There is no tax obligation to the employee until
                                              withdrawal.


                                    Profit-Sharing Plans
                                    A profit-sharing plan established by an employer allows employees to participate in the
                                    business’s profits. The benefits may be paid directly to the employee or deferred into an
                                    account for future payment, such as retirement, or a combination of both. This discussion
                                    concerns profit-sharing plans that defer benefits toward retirement.

                                    Profit-sharing plans need not have a predetermined contribution formula. Plans that do
                                    include such a formula generally express contributions as a fixed percentage of profits.

                                        In either event, to be qualified, a profit-sharing plan must have substantial and recurring
                                        contributions according to the Internal Revenue Code.

                                        Profit-sharing plans are popular because they offer employers the greatest amount of
                                        contribution flexibility. The ability to skip contributions during years of low profits appeals to
                                        corporations with unpredictable cash flows. They are also relatively easy to install, administer,
                                        and communicate to employees.


                                        401(k) Plans
                                        In a 401(k) plan, an employee directs an employer to deduct a percentage of the employee’s
                                        salary that will be a contribution to a retirement account. 401(k) plans permit an employer to
                                        make matching contributions up to a set percentage of the employee-directed contributions,
                                        making this a type of defined contribution plan. All contributions are made with pre-tax
                                        dollars. In effect, participating employees are reducing their salary by the amount of their
                                        contribution and, therefore, their W2 will show the actual salary less the 401(k) contribution.
                                        However, even though income taxes are based on this lower amount, FICA (Social Security)
                                        taxes are levied against gross salary, not this reduced amount. In 2021, the maximum employee
                                        elective deferral is set at $19,500 with an additional “catch-up” contribution limit of $6,500.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    An employer-sponsored 401(k) plan may be established with no required employer
                                                    or employee contributions. As we will shortly learn, there is one case where
                                                    employer contributions would be mandatory, but, for exam purposes, unless that
                                                    case is specified, it is up to the employer to determine if it will incorporate matching
                                                    contributions into the plan.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    When one includes the catch-up amount, the maximum combined employer and
                                                    employee contribution in a defined contribution plan increases from $58,000 to
                                                    $64,500 per year.

                                                    One of the benefits of investing through a 401(k) plan is that it takes advantage of
                                                    dollar cost averaging, a technique described in Unit 21, which always results in a lower
                                                    cost per share in a fluctuating market.


                                        Roth 401(k) Plans
                                        The Roth 401(k) is an option that may be added to an existing 401(k) plan. The Roth 401(k)
                                        option combines features of Roth IRAs and 401(k) retirement plans. Just as with a Roth IRA,
                                        these plans require after-tax contributions but allow tax-free withdrawals, provided the retiring
                                        person is at least 59½ years old at the time of the withdrawal. Once again, paralleling the
                                        Roth IRA, the account must be at least five years old to take tax-free withdrawals.

                                        Like a regular 401(k) plan, the Roth 401(k) plan has employer-matching contributions;
                                        however, the employer’s match must be deposited into a regular 401(k) plan and be fully
                                        taxable upon withdrawal. Thus, the employee must have two accounts: a regular 401(k) and
                                        a Roth 401(k). Employees may contribute to either account but may not transfer money
                                        between accounts once the money has been contributed.

                                    Unlike Roth IRAs, Roth 401(k) plans have no income limit restriction on who may
                                    participate. One may have both a Roth 401(k) plan and a Roth IRA, but the income limits
                                    would still apply to the Roth IRA. Unlike Roth IRAs, Roth 401(k) plans require withdrawals
                                    to begin no later than age 72, following the same rules that apply to all RMDs.


                                    SIMPLE Plans
                                    Savings Incentive Match Plans for Employees (SIMPLEs) are retirement plans for a business
                                    with 100 or fewer employees who earned $5,000 or more during the preceding calendar year.
                                    In addition, the business cannot currently have another retirement plan in place.

                                    The plans are easy to set up and inexpensive to administer. The employee’s contribution, up
                                    to $13,500 with a $3,000 catch-up provision (2021), is pre-tax and may be matched by the
                                    employer using either of the following two options:
                                     A 2% nonelective employer contribution, where employees eligible to participate receive
                                       an employer contribution equal to 2% of their compensation (limited to $290,000 per
                                       year for 2021 and subject to cost-of-living adjustments for later years), regardless of
                                       whether they make their own contributions.
                                     A dollar-for-dollar match up to 3% of compensation, where only the participating
                                       employees who have elected to make contributions will receive an employer contribution
                                       (i.e., the matching contribution).

                                    For small businesses looking for a way to have an inexpensive retirement plan for their
                                    employees, the SIMPLE is the way to go.

                                                  We’ve never heard of this being on the test, but, just in case, you might need to know
                                                  about a penalty tax levied under these plans that is unique. Unless qualifying for an
                                                  exception from the 10% penalty tax, such as that offered with traditional IRAs (over
                                                  59½, death or disability, etc.), withdrawals from a SIMPLE IRA within the first two years
                                                  after beginning participation in the plan are subject to a penalty tax of 25%.

                                        LO 18.d Identify the characteristics of a 403(b) plan.


                                        403(b) Plan
                                        A 403(b) plan, also known as a tax-sheltered annuity plan, is a retirement plan for certain
                                        employees of public schools, employees of certain IRS Code Section 501(c)(3) tax-exempt
                                        organizations, and certain ministers. A 403(b) plan allows employees to contribute some of
                                        their salary to the plan. The employer may also contribute to the plan for employees.

                                        403(b) plans, also known as a tax-sheltered annuity plan (TSA), are qualified tax-deferred
                                        retirement plans for employees of public school systems (403(b) employees) and tax-exempt
                                        organizations under IRS Code Section 501(c)(3), such as churches and private nonprofit
                                        organizations (501(c)(3) employees). A 403(b) plan allows qualified employees to contribute
                                        some of their salary to the plan. The employer may also contribute to the plan for employees.
                                        Like other retirement plans, these are intended to encourage retirement savings. To ensure this
                                        objective, 403(b)s, like IRAs and other retirement plans, are subject to tax penalties if savings
                                        are withdrawn before a participant reaches age 59½.


                                        Tax Advantages
                                        The following tax advantages apply to 403(b) plans.

                                        Income exclusion. If an eligible employee elects to make annual contributions to a 403(b),
                                        those contributions are excluded from the employee’s gross income for that year. The amount
                                        of the contribution is not reported as income, resulting in lower current income taxes.

                                        Tax-deferred accumulation. Earnings in a 403(b) accumulate with no current taxation of
                                        earnings or gains and do not increase the participant’s taxable income until the dollars are
                                        withdrawn at retirement, usually when that person is in a lower tax bracket.

                                        Investments. Historically, these plans were (and still are) referred to as tax-sheltered annuity
                                        plans (TSAs) because annuities were the only investment option. In 1974, a provision was
                                        made to permit the purchase of mutual funds as well, although it is estimated that more than
                                        85% of all 403(b) money is invested in either fixed or variable annuities.

                                        Guaranteed investment contracts (GICs). Another option for 403(b) plans (as well as
                                        401(k) plans) is the guaranteed investment contract, almost always referred to by its initials,
                                        GIC. These are contracts issued by insurance companies that offer a guaranteed return of
                                        principal at a certain date in the future and come with a fixed rate of return that is generally
                                        a bit higher than that offered by comparable bank CDs. However, unlike CDs, GICs are not
                                        federally insured; therefore, despite the inclusion of the word guaranteed in the title, GICs
                                        carry slightly more investment risk than CDs, and that is why their return is higher.


                                        Eligibility Requirements
                                        To be eligible to establish a 403(b), an employer must qualify as a:
                                         public educational 403(b) institution;

                                    Public Educational 403(b)
                                    To qualify as a public educational institution, an organization must be state supported, a
                                    political subdivision, or an agency of a state. Private school systems have a separate set of
                                    qualifying rules. State-run educational systems include:
                                     elementary schools;
                                     secondary schools;
                                     colleges and universities; and
                                     medical schools.
                                    Individuals employed by the above school systems in the following job classifications may
                                    enroll in a 403(b) plan. These include:
                                     teachers and other faculty members;
                                     administrators, managers, principals, supervisors, and other members of the
                                       administrative staff;
                                     counselors;
                                     clerical staff and maintenance workers; and
                                     individuals who perform services for the institution, such as doctors or nurses.


                                    Tax-Exempt 501(c)(3)
                                    As stated earlier, 501(c)(3) organizations are tax-exempt entities specifically cited in the IRC
                                    as eligible to establish 403(b)s for their employees. Typical 501(c)(3) organizations include:
                                     private colleges and universities;                                                                         Unit 18
                                     trade schools;
                                     parochial schools;
                                     zoos and museums;
                                     research and scientific foundations;
                                     religious and charitable institutions; and
                                     private hospitals and medical schools.

                                               TAKE NOTE
                                               Some 403(b) plans are subject to ERISA while others are not. Two of the most
                                               important exclusions from ERISA coverage are:
                                                governmental plans (e.g., plans sponsored by a state, county, or municipality or
                                                  one of their agencies, schools, or instrumentalities); and
                                                church plans, unless the plan sponsor has voluntarily elected to have the plan
                                                  covered by ERISA.

                                    Definition: employee. Only employees of qualified employers are eligible to participate in
                                    a 403(b) plan. Independent contractors are not eligible. It is the employer’s responsibility to
                                    determine an individual’s status or definition.

                                    Similar to other qualified plans, all 403(b)s (whether employer contribution or employee
                                    elective deferral) must be made available to each full-time employee who has both reached age
                                    21 and completed one year of service.

                                        Plan Requirements
                                        A 403(b) plan must meet two requirements.
                                         The plan must be in writing and must be made through a plan instrument, a trust
                                           agreement, or both.
                                         The employer must remit plan contributions to an annuity contract, a mutual fund, or
                                           another approved investment.


                                        Contribution Limits
                                        An employer can make contributions to a 403(b) solely on behalf of the covered employee or
                                        in conjunction with an employee deferral.


                                        Salary Reduction
                                        403(b) contributions are made by having the employee take a salary reduction. As such, the
                                        money is withdrawn prior to taxation. For 2021, the maximum is $19,500 with a $6,000
                                        catch-up provision.


                                        Employer Contributions
                                        Employer contributions to a 403(b) are generally subject to the same maximums that apply
                                        to all defined contribution plans: the lesser of 100% of the participant’s compensation or
                                        $58,000 per year.

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                         A retirement plan that allows the employee to make pre-tax contributions (within
                                                         certain limits), provides for tax deferral of earnings, and is available for employees of
                                                         public school systems and certain tax-exempt organizations is
                                                          A. a 403(b) plan.
                                                          B. a 401(k) plan.
                                                          C. an SEP IRA.
                                                          D. a payroll deduction plan.
                                                         Answer: A. The giveaway here is the public school employees—the 403(b) is their
                                                         plan as well as the plan offered to other employees of certain, but not all, tax-exempt
                                                         organizations.


                                        Section 457 Plans
                                        Although technically a nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plan, because of the
                                        many similarities to qualified corporate plans, and because they may be offered to the same
                                        tax-exempt organizations as the 403(b) plan, we are including them here.

                                        A Section 457(b) plan is a deferred compensation plan set up under Section 457 of the tax
                                        code that may be used by employees of a state, political subdivision of a state, and any agency
                                        or instrumentality of a state. This plan may also be offered to employees of certain tax-exempt
                                        organizations (hospitals, charitable organizations, unions, and so forth, but not churches).

                                        In a 457 plan, employees can defer compensation, and the amount deferred is not reportable
                                        for tax purposes. Therefore, the employee receives a deduction each year for the amount
                                        deferred.

                                    There are several important facts to know about 457 plans.
                                     These plans are not covered under ERISA—nongovernmental plans must be unfunded to
                                       qualify for tax benefits, while government plans must be funded.
                                     These plans are generally not required to follow the nondiscrimination rules of other
                                       retirement plans.
                                     While any employee or independent contractor of a governmental entity can be a
                                       participant, tax-exempt organizations that are nongovernmental must limit participation
                                       to management and highly compensated employee. Distributions from 457(b) plans of
                                       nongovernmental tax-exempt employees may not be rolled over into an IRA, but there is
                                       no 10% penalty for early withdrawal.
                                     It is possible to maintain both a 457 and a 403(b), or a 457 and a 401(k), and make
                                       maximum contributions to both ($19,500 × 2 = $39,000 in 2021). As a result, those 50
                                       or older, using the “catch-up” provision in each plan, could actually contribute as much as
                                       $52,000. You could also have an IRA along with the 457.
                                     Loans from a 457(b) plan are available in governmental plans only, and only if the entity
                                       decides to include that feature in the plan. Furthermore, the requirements for “unforeseen
                                       emergency” withdrawals are much stricter than for hardship withdrawals under a 401(k) plan.

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  A basic difference between a Section 457 plan established on behalf of a
                                                  governmental entity and one established by a private tax-exempt organization is that
                                                   A. a governmental plan must hold its assets in trust or custodial accounts for the
                                                       benefit of individual participants.

                                                                                                                                                   Unit 18
                                                   B. a tax-exempt plan participant does not have to include plan distributions in his
                                                       or her taxable income.
                                                   C. a governmental plan cannot make a distribution before the participant attains
                                                       age 72.
                                                   D. a tax-exempt plan’s distributions are not eligible for a favorable lump-sum
                                                       10-year averaging treatment.
                                                  Answer: A. A governmental Section 457 plan must be funded—that is, it must hold
                                                  plan assets in trusts or custodial accounts for the benefit of individual participants.
                                                  Conversely, a tax-exempt (nongovernmental) Section 457 plan may not be funded.



                                    LO 18.e Contrast qualified and nonqualified retirement plans.

                                    Up until now, we have discussed qualified plans (and, because of its many similarities, the
                                    457 plan). Corporations often elect to provide a nonqualified plan. Nonqualified means that
                                    the plan is not subject to the requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act
                                    of 1974 (ERISA). A nonqualified plan does not allow the employer a current tax deduction
                                    for contributions. Instead, the employer receives the tax deduction when the money is
                                    actually paid out to the employee. If the plan is currently funded (many employers wait
                                    until the time to pay and use current earnings), depending on the way the plan is structured,
                                    earnings may or may not accumulate on a tax-deferred basis. That is an infrequently tested
                                    item. A nonqualified plan need not comply with nondiscrimination rules that apply to
                                    qualified plans. The employer can make nonqualified benefits available to key employees and
                                    exclude others.

                                    Nonqualified plans are not subject to the same reporting and disclosure requirements as
                                    qualified plans; as mentioned, they are not covered by ERISA. However, nonqualified plans

                                        still must be in writing and communicated to the plan participants. Even though these plans
                                        are exempt from ERISA requirements, sponsors of nonqualified plans are fiduciaries and can
                                        be held liable for acting contrary to fiduciary standards.


                                        Taxation of Contributions
                                        The corporation cannot deduct nonqualified plan contributions made on behalf of
                                        participants until paid to the participant. However, if the nonqualified plan is properly
                                        designed, contributions are not taxable to the employee until the benefit is received.

                                        Contributions to nonqualified plans that have already been taxed make up the investor’s cost
                                        base. When the investor withdraws money from the nonqualified plan, the cost base is not
                                        taxed. However, earnings are taxed when withdrawn.


                                        Types of Nonqualified Plans
                                        Three types of nonqualified plans are payroll deduction plans, deferred compensation plans,
                                        and supplemental executive retirement (or retention) plans.


                                        Payroll Deduction Plans
                                        A payroll deduction plan involves a deduction from an employee’s check on a weekly,
                                        monthly, or quarterly basis as authorized by the employee. This is the primary case where
                                        the money is deducted after taxes are paid and may be invested in investment vehicles at the
                                        employee’s option. As mentioned above, when withdrawn, only the excess over the cost basis
                                        (those after-tax contributions) is subject to tax. The most common investments are employer
                                        stock or United States savings bonds.


                                        Deferred Compensation Plans
                                        A nonqualified deferred compensation (NQDC) plan is a contractual agreement between a
                                        firm and an employee in which the employee agrees to defer receipt of current compensation
                                        in favor of a payout at retirement. The agreement underlying a deferred compensation plan
                                        usually includes the following:
                                         Conditions and circumstances under which some or all of the benefits may be forfeited,
                                           such as if the employee moves to a competing firm
                                         A statement to the effect that the employee is not entitled to any claim against the
                                           employer’s assets until retirement, death, or disability
                                         A disclaimer that the agreement may be void if the firm suffers a business failure or
                                           bankruptcy

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    Because the employer can discriminate, one of the most common uses of deferred
                                                    compensation plans is to provide benefits to retain key employees.

                                        Generally, an employee enjoys no benefits from a deferred compensation plan until
                                        retirement. If the business fails, the employee is a general creditor of the business with no
                                        guarantee that he will receive the deferred payment.

                                               PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                      Which of the following objectives would not be met by an employer’s use of a
                                                      nonqualified retirement plan?
                                                       A. The employer desires current tax savings.
                                                       B. The employer desires an alternative to the qualified plan because of the
                                                           complexity of legislative changes.
                                                       C. The employer needs to bring executive retirement benefits up to desired levels
                                                           by adding a second tier of benefits on top of the qualified plan.
                                                       D. The employer desires a plan in which benefits may legally discriminate in favor
                                                           of highly compensated employees.
                                                      Answer: A. Tax benefits on a NQDC plan only result when the employee receives
                                                      payment, so choice A is correct. All of the other statements describe situations in

                                                                                                                                                     Unit 18
                                                      which employers might benefit from establishing a nonqualified retirement plan.


                                    SERP
                                    A supplemental executive retirement plan (SERP) provides benefits to executives over and
                                    above the benefits available from a qualified plan and is funded entirely with employer
                                    funds. The plan can be either completely unfunded (like an excess benefit plan) or informally
                                    funded. The plan rewards an executive’s continued employment or encourages the early
                                    retirement of the executive. A SERP also may be established to protect the executive from
                                    involuntary termination if the company changes ownership by awarding her increased benefits
                                    from the plan. The “R” sometimes refers to retention because these plans do encourage key
                                    employees to remain until they qualify for the benefit.

          LESSON 18.4: TAXATION OF QUALIFIED PLANS
                                        LO 18.f Identify the tax treatment of distributions from qualified
                                        plans.

                                        If all of the funds were contributed by the employer (known as a noncontributory plan), the
                                        employee’s tax basis (cost) is zero. If the employee contribution were pre-tax, the basis for that
                                        is zero as well. Because everything above the cost is taxed at the employee’s ordinary income
                                        rate at the time of distribution, in most cases all funds received are fully taxable.

                                        Distributions from a 403(b) must follow the same rules as distributions from all qualified
                                        plans. Because the employee’s 403(b) contributions are made with pre-tax dollars and all
                                        earnings were tax deferred, any distribution is subject to ordinary income tax rates in the year
                                        it is received. A normal distribution can start at age 59½. Premature distribution is subject to
                                        a 10% penalty tax, and the RMD rules apply as well.

                                        401(k) plans are permitted to make hardship withdrawals available to participants facing
                                        serious and immediate financial difficulty. There are maximum limits: the amount withdrawn
                                        is not eligible for a rollover and, therefore, is taxable as ordinary income and possibly the
                                        10% penalty. It differs from a 401(k) loan, which is not taxable as long as the repayment
                                        requirements of the IRS are met.


                                        401(k) Plan Loans
                                        Somewhat different from the hardship withdrawal is the ability to borrow from the 401(k).
                                        This has the advantage of not being treated as a distribution, so there is no tax. However, if
                                        certain IRS rules are not followed, it will be considered a premature distribution and taxed
                                        as such. The IRS maximum loan amount is 50% of the participant’s vested share or $50,000,
                                        whichever is smaller. All loans must carry what the IRS considers to be a “reasonable rate of
                                        interest.” Specifically, the interest rate charged for a loan can’t be more favorable than what
                                        the participant can get from a financial institution for a similarly secured loan. Other than if
                                        used for a home mortgage, the loan must be paid back on a regular schedule (usually through
                                        payroll deduction) in a period not to exceed 60 months.

                                                PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                    Susan participates in a Section 401(k) plan at work that includes loan provisions.
                                                    Susan has recently enrolled in college and has inquired about the possible
                                                    consequences of borrowing from the plan to help pay for her education. As her
                                                    financial planner, what is your advice to her?
                                                      A. The loan will statutorily be treated as a taxable distribution from the plan.
                                                      B. The loan must be repayable within five years at a reasonable rate of interest.
                                                      C. The 401(k) plan needs to be rewritten, as loans are only available from
                                                         qualified plans.
                                                      D. The loan is not being made for reasons of an unforeseeable emergency and
                                                         therefore is not possible.
                                                    Answer: B. For a loan not to be treated as a taxable distribution for tax purposes,
                                                    it must be repayable within five years at a reasonable rate of interest. The
                                                    unforeseeable emergency requirements are found in a Section 457 plan.


                                    Net Unrealized Appreciation (NUA)
                                    Many employers enable employees to buy the stock or bonds of their company inside the
                                    401(k) or other retirement plans. The distribution of employer securities is sometimes
                                    eligible for special treatment under the tax code. Those receiving a distribution of employer
                                    securities from a qualified retirement plan may be able to defer the tax on the net unrealized
                                    appreciation (NUA) in the securities. The NUA is the net increase in the securities’ value
                                    while they were in the plan’s trust. If taken as a lump-sum distribution, the participant has
                                    the option of deferring tax on all of the NUA. A lump-sum distribution is defined as the
                                    disbursement of the entire vested account balance within one taxable year as the result of a
                                                                                                                                                   Unit 18
                                    triggering event. Triggering events are limited to:
                                     separation from service;
                                     attainment of age 59½; or
                                     death.
                                    In order to qualify for the NUA treatment, an employee must complete the entire distribution
                                    within the same calendar year. How does this work? Normally, the entire value of a
                                    distribution from a qualified plan is taxed as ordinary income. Even if rolled over into an
                                    IRA, when ultimately distributed, the entire value will be taxed as ordinary income. However,
                                    when using the NUA approach, only the original cost basis (as supplied by the employer) is
                                    subject to tax. Any unrealized appreciation will be taxed as a long-term capital gain whenever
                                    sold. And, to make things even sweeter, as long as it is held more than 12 months, any further
                                    appreciation is taxed as a long-term capital gain. Let’s take a look at an example.

                                                EXAMPLE
                                                George has been an employee of KAPCO Manufacturing Company for 20 years. He is
                                                turning 65 this year and plans to retire. In his 401(k) plan, he has assets of $600,000
                                                of which $250,000 is KAPCO stock with a cost basis of $100,000. At retirement, George
                                                should transfer the $350,000 that is not KAPCO stock into an IRA. That will defer
                                                taxes on that money. Then, the $250,000 of KAPCO stock should be transferred into
                                                a regular, taxable brokerage account. In the year of retirement, George will have
                                                to report the $100,000 cost basis as ordinary income. However, the $150,000 in
                                                unrealized appreciation will receive the more favorable long-term capital gains rate
                                                when sold. If George holds onto the stock for another five years and it appreciates by
                                                another $50,000, then, upon sale, the entire $200,000 of gain is considered long term.

                                        Summary of Distribution Rules from Both Qualified Plans and
                                        IRAs
                                        Even though we have previously discussed IRA withdrawals, it is worth repeating them here to
                                        compare and contrast them with distributions from qualified plans.

                                        Distributions from traditional IRAs must generally begin no later than April 1 of the year
                                        following the year in which the taxpayer attains age 72.

                                        In applying distribution rules, all traditional IRAs and SEPs are treated as a single account
                                        and must be liquidated at least to the extent of percentages specified on IRS tables. Qualified
                                        plans, however, are not aggregated; distributions from one qualified plan are not affected by
                                        distributions from another. What that means is an individual with multiple IRAs computes the
                                        RMD from each but can elect to distribute the amounts from each IRA or select the IRA(s)
                                        from which to make the distribution. In the case of multiple qualified plans (the individual
                                        worked for more than one employer and did not rollover the earlier employer’s plan), the
                                        required RMD must be taken from each plan; there is no combining as there is with IRAs.


                                        Early Withdrawal Penalties
                                        In general, withdrawals from both IRAs and qualified plans are taxed as ordinary income.
                                        However, withdrawals from such arrangements occurring before owners turn age 59½ are
                                        subject to an additional 10% early withdrawal tax. Withdrawals from both escape that 10%
                                        tax when they are made on account of death or total disability, correcting excess contributions,
                                        or as a series of substantially equal payments over the life of the plan participant and
                                        beneficiary, if applicable. Only in the case of a qualified plan is the penalty avoided by using a
                                        qualified domestic relations order (QDRO).


                                        Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO)
                                        As just stated, premature distributions that are taken pursuant to a qualified domestic
                                        relations order, or QDRO, are exempt from the 10% early withdrawal tax. That is, when the
                                        plan participant distributes a portion of the plan to a spouse or former spouse who is under
                                        59½ years of age, the participant is not charged the 10% tax for an early withdrawal.

                                        A QDRO is a judgment, decree, or order, usually issued in the course of divorce proceedings,
                                        for a retirement plan to pay child support, alimony, or marital property rights to a spouse,
                                        former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant. The QDRO must contain certain
                                        specific information, such as:
                                         the plan participant and each alternate payee’s name and last known mailing address; and
                                         the amount or percentage of the participant’s benefits to be paid to each alternate payee.
                                        A spouse or former spouse who receives QDRO benefits from a retirement plan reports the
                                        payments received as if they were a plan participant. That means if they are under 59½, they
                                        are liable for the 10% early withdrawal tax.

                                        An individual may be able to roll over tax-free all or part of a distribution from a qualified
                                        retirement plan that they received under a QDRO, but only if they are the employee’s spouse
                                        or former spouse. In that case, they can roll it over, just as if they were the employee receiving
                                        a plan distribution and choosing to roll it over.

                                        A QDRO distribution that is paid to a child or other dependent is taxed to the plan
                                        participant and will incur the 10% early withdrawal tax if the recipient is under 59½.

                                    A QDRO applies only to assets in a qualified employer plan; it would not be applicable to an
                                    IRA or a SEP.

                                               The 10% tax will not apply on withdrawals from either of these before age 59½,

                                                  must continue for at least five years or until the employee/individual reaches age
                                                  59½, whichever is the longer period.) This applies when the separation of service
                                                  occurs once the employee has attained age 55.

                                               TAKE NOTE
                                               After a person begins taking distributions from an IRA under Rule 72(t), contributions,            Unit 18
                                               asset transfers, or rollovers are not permitted while receiving payments.


                                    Penalty Tax on Failure to Make Required Minimum Distributions
                                    As with IRAs, other than a Roth IRA, failure to distribute the required amount from qualified
                                    plans generates a 50% penalty tax on the shortfall in addition to ordinary income taxation.
                                    However, as mentioned earlier, and of particular importance as employees are working to
                                    much later ages than in previous generations, there are no RMDs from a qualified plan while
                                    still employed by the sponsor of that plan, regardless of your age.


                                    Withholding on Eligible Rollover Distributions from Qualified Plans
                                    Distributions paid to an employee are subjected to a mandatory federal withholding of 20% if
                                    the distribution is an eligible rollover distribution. Eligible rollover distributions (those which
                                    can be rolled over or transferred without current taxation) do not include the following:
                                     RMDs;
                                     a hardship distribution;
                                     substantially equal lifetime payments (SEPP);
                                     a distribution of an excess contribution; or
                                     a loan that is treated as a deemed distribution.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    An employee may avoid the 20% withholding by having the distribution processed
                                                    as a direct rollover to an eligible retirement plan. In a direct rollover the distribution
                                                    check is made payable to the trustee or custodian of the receiving retirement plan.

                                        Summary of Rollover and Transfer Rules
                                        Following is a summary of the rules that apply to moving money from one tax-deferred
                                        account to another. Here are the three key points:
                                        1. Direct rollover—In the event the qualified plan calls for a distribution upon separation
                                           from service, a request can be made to the plan administrator to send the payment
                                           directly to another retirement plan or to an IRA. In this case, there are no taxes withheld
                                           from the amount transferred, and no income is reported for tax purposes.
                                        2. Trustee to trustee transfer—If an investor wishes to change trustees for an IRA,
                                           such as moving the account to another firm or mutual fund group, upon request, the
                                           trustee or custodian for the “old” IRA will make the payment directly to the trustee of
                                           the “new” IRA. In some cases, the IRA distribution may be made to the trustees of an
                                           employer-sponsored plan in this fashion. In either case, there are no taxes withheld from
                                           the amount transferred, and no income is reported for tax purposes.
                                        3. 60-day rollover—In the event the distribution from an IRA or qualified employer plan
                                           is paid directly to the participant, there is the option to deposit all or any part of it to
                                           another IRA or qualified plan within 60 calendar days. However, there will be a 20%
                                           withholding tax on this distribution from the qualified plan (withholding is optional on
                                           the IRA distribution). That means, in order to avoid any tax, the individual will have to
                                           find other funds to deposit to cover the withheld amount. Any portion of the distribution
                                           that is not rolled over will be subject to tax and, if under age 59½, will be subject to the
                                           10% (unless qualifying for one of the exemptions from the penalty tax).

                                    ERISA
                                    ERISA guidelines for the regulation of retirement plans include the following:
                                     Eligibility. If a company offers a retirement plan, all employees must be covered if they
                                       are 21 years old or older, have one year of service, and work 1,000 hours per year. The
                                       SECURE Act added a provision for permanent part-time employees covered under
                                       a 401(k) plan. These are individuals who worked at least 500 hours per year for the
                                       previous three consecutive years.
                                     Funding. Funds contributed to the plan must be segregated from other corporate assets.
                                       The plan’s trustees have a fiduciary responsibility to invest prudently and manage funds in
                                       a way that represents the best interests of all participants.
                                     Vesting. Employees must be entitled to their entire retirement benefit amounts within a
                                       certain time, even if they no longer work for the employer.
                                     Communication. The retirement plan must be in writing, and employees must be kept
                                       informed of plan benefits, availability, account status, and vesting procedure no less
                                       frequently than annually.
                                     Nondiscrimination. A uniformly applied formula determines employee benefits and
                                       contributions. Such a method ensures equitable and impartial treatment.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    ERISA is often referred to as the Pension Reform Act, but it regulates almost all types
                                                    of employee benefit plans and personal retirement plans.

                                        ERISA regulations apply to private sector (corporate or private tax-exempt entities) plans only.
                                        Plans for federal or state government workers (public sector plans) are not subject to ERISA.


                                        Fiduciary Responsibility Under ERISA
                                        Because most retirement plans were set up under trust agreements, when it became time for
                                        ERISA to address fiduciary responsibilities of plan trustees, there was a long history of trust
                                        law to fall back on.

                                        It all began with the Prudent Man Rule. That legal standard was established in 1830 by a
                                        Massachusetts Court decision (Harvard College v. Amory, 9 Pick. [26 Mass.] 446, 461 [1830]):

                                        “All that is required of a trustee to invest is, that he shall conduct himself faithfully and exercise
                                        sound discretion. He is to observe how men of prudence, discretion and intelligence manage their
                                        own affairs, not in regard to speculation, but in regard to the permanent disposition of their funds,
                                        considering the probable income, as well as the probable safety of the capital to be invested.”

                                        Although it was possible to place common stock in a trust portfolio, the emphasis seemed
                                        to be on taking defensive positions that, while preserving capital, did expose the portfolio to
                                        inflation risk. It was clear that some updating was necessary.

                                        Beginning with the dynamic growth of the stock markets in the late 1960s, the investment
                                        practices of fiduciaries experienced significant change. As a result, the Uniform Prudent
                                        Investor Act (UPIA) was adopted in 1994 as an attempt to update trust investment laws in
                                        recognition of those many changes. One of the major influences on this legislation was the
                                        growing acceptance of modern portfolio theory. The UPIA (now used in almost every state)
                                        makes five fundamental alterations in the former criteria for prudent investing. Those changes
                                        are as follows:
                                         The standard of prudence is applied to any investment as part of the total portfolio, rather
                                           than to individual investments. In this context, the term portfolio means all of the trust’s
                                           or estate’s assets.
                                         The trade-off in all investments between risk and return is identified as the fiduciary’s
                                           primary consideration.
                                         All categorical restrictions on types of investments have been removed; the trustee can
                                           invest in anything that plays an appropriate role in achieving the risk/return objectives of
                                           the trust and meets the other requirements of prudent investing.
                                         The well-accepted requirement that fiduciaries diversify their investments has been
                                           integrated into the definition of prudent investing.
                                         The much-criticized former rule forbidding the trustee to delegate investment functions
                                           has been reversed. Delegation is now permitted, subject to safeguards.

                                        With greater numbers of trustees delegating investment decisions to investment advisers,
                                        NASAA has determined that you must know how the UPIA affects your role. Here are some
                                        thoughts that will help you on the exam.
                                         A trustee must invest and manage trust assets as a prudent investor would, by considering
                                           the purposes, terms, distribution requirements, and other circumstances of the trust. In
                                           satisfying this standard, the trustee must exercise reasonable care, skill, and caution.

                                     A trustee’s investment and management decisions about individual assets must be
                                       evaluated not in isolation but in the context of the total portfolio and as a part of an
                                       overall investment strategy with risk and return objectives that are reasonably suited to the
                                       trust.
                                     Among circumstances that a trustee must consider in investing and managing trust assets
                                       are any of the following that are relevant to the trust or its beneficiaries:
                                        –– General economic conditions
                                        –– The possible effect of inflation or deflation
                                        –– The expected tax consequences of investment decisions or strategies
                                        –– The role that each asset plays within the total portfolio, including financial assets,
                                           tangible and intangible personal property, and real property
                                        –– The expected total return from income and the appreciation of capital
                                        –– Other resources of the beneficiaries
                                        –– Needs for liquidity, regularity of income, and preservation or appreciation of capital
                                        –– An asset’s special relationship or special value, if any, to the purposes of the trust or to
                                           one or more of the beneficiaries
                                     A trustee who has special skills or expertise, or who is named trustee in reliance upon the
                                       trustee’s representation that the trustee has special skills or expertise, has a duty to use
                                       those special skills or expertise. This particular item led to the most stringent standard,
                                       that of the prudent expert for one acting as a professional money manager.
                                     For those without special skills or expertise, a trustee may delegate investment and

                                                                                                                                                  Unit 18
                                       management functions as long as the trustee exercises reasonable care, skill, and caution
                                       in:
                                        –– selecting the adviser,
                                        –– establishing the scope and terms of the delegation, consistent with the purposes and
                                           terms of the trust, and
                                        –– periodically reviewing the adviser’s actions to monitor the adviser’s performance
                                           and compliance with the terms of the delegation. (However, something that cannot
                                           be delegated is the amount and timing of distributions. If it is for a trust, the trust
                                           document usually spells out those provisions, and, in the case of a qualified retirement
                                           plan, the plan document accomplishes the same purpose.)
                                     A trustee who complies with all of the above is not liable to the beneficiaries or the trust
                                       for the decisions or actions of the adviser to whom the function was delegated.
                                     In performing a delegated function, the adviser owes a duty to the trust to exercise
                                       reasonable care to comply with the terms of the delegation.

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   Which of the following would best describe a prudent investor?
                                                    A. A person in a fiduciary capacity who invests in a prudent manner
                                                    B. A trustee who invests with reasonable care, skill, and caution
                                                    C. An investment adviser representative handling a discretionary account
                                                    D. The custodian for a minor under the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act
                                                   Answer: B. Although all of these may have a fiduciary responsibility, the definition,
                                                   as expressed in the Uniform Prudent Investor Act of 1994, requires reasonable care,
                                                   skill, and caution.

                                        Section 404 of ERISA
                                        Specifically, there are a number of regulations that apply directly to retirement plan fiduciaries.
                                        The details are spelled out in ERISA Section 404.

                                        Under Section 404 of ERISA, every person who acts as a fiduciary for an employee benefit
                                        plan must perform his responsibilities in accordance with the plan document specifications.
                                        Under ERISA, trustees cannot delegate fiduciary duties, but they can delegate investment
                                        management responsibilities to a qualified investment manager.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    Although the UPIA permits the delegation of portfolio management decisions, trustees
                                                    cannot delegate certain fiduciary duties, such as determining the amount and timing
                                                    of distributions.

                                        Fiduciary responsibilities to the plan are explicit. With respect to the plan, fiduciaries must
                                        act:
                                         solely in the interest of plan participants and beneficiaries;
                                         for the exclusive purpose of providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries and
                                           defraying reasonable plan expenses;
                                         with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that
                                           a prudent professional would use (known as the prudent expert rule);
                                         to diversify investments to minimize the risk of large losses, unless doing so is clearly not
                                           prudent under the circumstances; and
                                         in accordance with the governing plan documents unless they are not consistent with
                                           ERISA.

                                        Under ERISA provisions, the fiduciary must be as prudent as the average expert, not the
                                        average person. To act with care, skill, prudence, and caution, the fiduciary must also:
                                         diversify plan assets;
                                         make investment decisions under the prudent expert standard;
                                         monitor investment performance;
                                         control investment expenses; and
                                         not engage in prohibited transactions.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    A plan participant or beneficiary who controls his or her specific plan account is not a
                                                    fiduciary.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    You may be required to know that transaction cost is not a determining factor in
                                                    security selection. That is, when the fiduciary is deciding what security will fit the
                                                    needs of the portfolio, the amount of commission involved in the purchase is not
                                                    considered when determining if that security is an appropriate addition.

                                    Investment Policy Statement
                                    Although it is not specifically mandated under ERISA, it is strongly suggested that each
                                    employee benefit plan have an investment policy statement, preferably in writing, that
                                    serves as a guideline for the plan’s fiduciary regarding funding and investment management
                                    decisions. Investment policy statements address the specific needs of the plan.

                                    For employee benefit plans that use outside investment managers (such as mutual funds), the
                                    fiduciary must ensure that the investment alternatives available to plan members are consistent
                                    with the policy statement.

                                    A typical investment policy statement (IPS) will include:
                                     investment objectives for the plan;
                                     determination for meeting future cash flow needs;
                                     investment philosophy including asset allocation style;
                                     investment selection criteria (but not the specific securities themselves); and
                                     methods for monitoring procedures and performance.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              The IPS will not include specific security selection.


                                    Prohibited Investments Under ERISA
                                    It is important to differentiate between prohibited investments and prohibited transactions.
                                                                                                                                                  Unit 18
                                    Similar to IRAs, qualified plans cannot invest in art, antiques, gems, coins, collectibles, or
                                    alcoholic beverages. They can invest in precious metals, such as gold and silver coins minted
                                    by the U.S. Treasury, only if they meet various federal requirements. ERISA also limits how
                                    much some plans can invest in the employer’s stock. Although not specifically prohibited
                                    under ERISA, the exam will never find writing uncovered calls in a retirement plan to be a
                                    prudent decision.


                                    Prohibited Transactions by the Plan Fiduciary
                                    ERISA allows for a wide range of investments and investment practices, but a plan fiduciary is
                                    strictly prohibited from any conflicts of interest, such as:
                                     self-dealing—dealing with plan assets in his own interest or for his own account;
                                     acting in a transaction involving the plan on behalf of a party with interests adverse to the
                                       plan; and
                                     receiving any compensation for his personal account from any party dealing with the plan
                                       in connection with plan transactions.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              Under Section 407 of ERISA, a plan may not acquire any security or real (or personal)
                                              property of the employer, if immediately after such acquisition the aggregate fair
                                              market value of employer securities and employer real property held by the plan
                                              exceeds 10% of the fair market value of the assets of the plan.

                                        Party in Interest
                                        ERISA has a rather broad definition of the term party in interest, but it basically includes
                                        anyone who can have an impact on an employee benefit plan, including those who render
                                        advice to the plan. It is not an overstatement to say that all transactions involving parties in
                                        interest to an ERISA-covered plan are prohibited, unless there is an exemption for them.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    Anyone in the position of trustee over the assets of a qualified plan may not use the
                                                    plan assets to make loans to the employer, even if failure to do so could lead to the
                                                    company suffering a financial failure.


                                        Safe Harbor Provisions of Section 404(c)
                                        Several times, we have mentioned the requirement for the plan fiduciary to diversify the
                                        plan’s investments. There is a particular part of ERISA, Section 404(c), dealing with 401(k)
                                        plans that provides a safe harbor from liability for the trustee if certain conditions are met.
                                        Under ERISA Section 404(c), a fiduciary is not liable for losses to the plan resulting from
                                        the participant’s selection of investment in his or her own account, provided the participant
                                        exercised control over the investment and the plan met the detailed requirements of a
                                        Department of Labor regulation—that is, the 404(c) regulation.

                                        There are three basic conditions of this regulation:
                                         Investment selection
                                         Investment control
                                         Communicating required information
                                        Let’s look at these individually.


                                        Investment Selection
                                        A 404(c) plan participant must be able to:
                                         materially affect portfolio return potential and risk level;
                                         choose between at least three investment alternatives; and
                                         diversify the investment to minimize the risk of large losses.
                                        The practical effect of this is that it would be highly unlikely for the plan to meet the
                                        requirements by limiting the available choices to highly speculative funds, such as junk bond
                                        funds and highly aggressive growth funds.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    The trustee of a 401(k) would be able to reduce her ERISA fiduciary exposure and
                                                    meet the safe harbor provisions of 404(c) if the plan offered a broad index fund, a
                                                    medium-term government bond fund, and a cash equivalent fund. It isn’t the number
                                                    of funds that counts; it is the different asset classes available. For example, if the plan
                                                    offered 10 investment options instead of 3, but they were all of the same asset class,
                                                    such as 10 equity funds or 10 bond funds, that would not comply with 404(c).

                                    Investment Control
                                    Investment control is defined as:
                                     allowing employees the opportunity to exercise independent control over the assets in
                                       their account by letting them make their own choices among the investment options
                                       companies have selected (at least three);
                                     informing employees that they can change their investment allocations at least quarterly
                                       (a growing number of plans allow employees to make plan changes daily); and
                                     even though the employees maintain investment control, the plan fiduciary is not relieved
                                       of the responsibility to monitor the performance of the investment alternatives being
                                       offered and replace them when necessary.


                                    Communicating Required Information
                                    Communicating required information means:
                                     making certain information available upon request, such as prospectuses and financial
                                       statements or reports relating to the investment options (included must be information
                                       such as annual operating expenses and portfolio composition);
                                     a statement that the plan is intended to constitute an ERISA Section 404(c) plan and that
                                       plan fiduciaries may be relieved of liability for investment losses;
                                     a description of the risk and return characteristics of each of the investment alternatives
                                       available under the plan;
                                     an explanation of how to give investment instructions; and

                                                                                                                                                   Unit 18
                                     allowing real-time access to employee accounts, either by telephone or the internet.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              Although we have made extensive reference to control in the previous pages, that
                                              must be taken in context. Participants in a 401(k) do have a choice of investments, but
                                              that choice is limited to the package included in the employer’s plan. Participants in
                                              a 403(b) plan have even fewer choices; annuities are the primary investment asset in
                                              those plans. If investment choice is the criteria, then the greatest control is with an IRA
                                              (see the earlier discussion on IRA investments).

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   To comply with the safe harbor requirements of Section 404(c) of ERISA, the trustee
                                                   of a 401(k) plan must
                                                      I. offer plan participants at least 10 different investment alternatives.
                                                     II. allow plan participants to exercise control over their investments.
                                                    III. allow plan participants to change their investment options no less frequently
                                                         than monthly.
                                                    IV. provide plan participants with information relating to the risks and
                                                         performance of each investment alternative offered.
                                                     A. I and III
                                                     B. I and IV
                                                     C. II and III
                                                     D. II and IV
                                                   Answer: D. To comply with the safe harbor provisions of ERISA’s Section 404(c), the
                                                   plan trustee must allow each participant control over their investments and furnish
                                                   them with full performance and risk information. Choice D contains both of these.
                                                   The rule only mandates a minimum of three alternatives and quarterly changes.

                                        Summary Plan Description (SPD)
                                        Sometimes referred to as the summary plan document, one of the most important documents
                                        participants are entitled to receive automatically when becoming a participant of an
                                        ERISA-covered retirement plan or a beneficiary receiving benefits under such a plan is a
                                        summary of the plan, called the summary plan description (SPD). Under regulations of the
                                        U.S. Department of Labor (DOL), the plan administrator is legally obligated to provide
                                        to participants, free of charge, the SPD. The summary plan description is an important
                                        document that tells participants what the plan provides and how it operates. It provides
                                        information on when an employee can begin to participate in the plan, how service and
                                        benefits are calculated, when benefits become vested, when and in what form benefits are
                                        paid, and how to file a claim for benefits. Unlike the investment policy statement, it does not
                                        deal with the investment characteristics of the plan.


                                        Top-Heavy Plan
                                        Because all qualified plans must be nondiscriminatory, the IRS has defined a top-heavy
                                        401(k) plan as one in which a disproportionate amount of the benefit goes to key employees.
                                        The plan must be tested on an annual basis to ensure that it complies with the regulations. On
                                        the exam, you may be asked to define a top-heavy plan and will have to choose between key
                                        employees and highly compensated employees. The easiest way to remember is to match the
                                        (k) in 401(k) with the word key.


                                        Safe Harbor 401(k) Plan
                                        Several years after the top-heavy rules were written, relief was offered in the form of the safe
                                        harbor 401(k). A plan does not have to undergo annual top-heavy testing if set up properly.

                                        There are two basic choices for setting up a safe harbor plan. The employer will either match
                                        employee contributions or use a nonelective formula (the employees don’t have to contribute)
                                        of eligible employee compensation to satisfy IRS requirements. If a matching formula is
                                        elected:
                                        In either case, all employer contributions are immediately vested.
                                         The base formula is 100% of elective deferrals up to 3% of compensation and then 50%
                                           of elective deferrals on the next 2% of compensation. This means the maximum match is
                                           4% (100% × 3% + 50% × 2% = 3% + 1%); or
                                         The employer may elect the nonelective formula (minimum of 3%) of all eligible
                                           participants’ compensation. Under this formula, all eligible employees would receive this
                                           nonelective contribution, whether making salary reduction contributions or not.

             LESSON 18.6: EDUCATION FUNDING PROGRAMS
                                    LO 18.h Compare the differences between the two major types of
                                    education funding programs.

                                    The examination will deal with two different types of programs designed to offer tax benefits
                                    when saving for education. We will begin with the Coverdell ESA and then move on to the
                                    Section 529 plan.


                                    Coverdell Education Savings Accounts (ESAs)                                                                   Unit 18
                                    The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 also created Education IRAs. In 2002, these were renamed
                                    Coverdell ESAs. ESAs allow after-tax contributions for student beneficiaries. Contributions
                                    must be made in cash and must be made on or before the date on which the beneficiary
                                    attains age 18 unless the beneficiary is a special-needs beneficiary—an individual who
                                    because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition requires additional time to complete
                                    their education. Coverdell ESAs fund educational expenses of a designated beneficiary by
                                    allowing after-tax (nondeductible) contributions to accumulate on a tax-deferred basis.

                                    When distributions are made from a Coverdell ESA, the earnings portion of the distribution
                                    is excluded from income when it is used to pay qualified education expenses. Withdrawn
                                    earnings are taxed to the recipient (beneficiary) and subject to a 10% tax penalty when they
                                    are not used to pay qualified education expenses.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              If the money is not used by a beneficiary’s 30th birthday (except for a special-needs
                                              beneficiary), it must be distributed, and the earnings are subject to ordinary income
                                              taxes and a 10% penalty.

                                        ESA Contributions
                                        Under current law, the maximum annual contribution limit to a Coverdell ESA is $2,000
                                        per beneficiary. Because this number is considered permanent, it can and does appear on the
                                        exam.

                                        In addition to qualified higher education expenses (postsecondary education), the account
                                        can also be used for elementary and secondary education expenses and for public, private, or
                                        religious schools.

                                        The contribution to a Coverdell ESA may be limited depending on the amount of AGI and
                                        filing status.

                                                   Allowable Contribution                                   Single Filers Joint Filers

                                                   Partial phase-out begins at                                 $95,001      $190,001
                                                   No contributions may be made at AGI of and above           $110,000      $220,000


                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    There is nothing to prevent more than one individual from contributing to a Coverdell
                                                    ESA; the annual limit applies to each beneficiary. Parents and grandparents can
                                                    contribute to a single account as long as the $2,000 limit per child is not exceeded in
                                                    any given year.

                                        Other changes made since the original Education IRA include:
                                         provisions that allow contributions to continue past age 18 for beneficiaries with special
                                           needs;
                                         extending the period during which corrective withdrawals can be made to avoid the early
                                           distribution and excess contribution penalties; and
                                         allowing Coverdell ESA contributions, for any year, to be made up to April 15 of the
                                           following year (just like contributions to your IRA).

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    Here are some key test points about Coverdell ESAs:
                                                     Contributions can be made by parents and other adults; the total for one child is
                                                       still $2,000.
                                                     Contribution limit is $2,000 per year per child until the child’s 18th birthday.
                                                     Contributions are not tax deductible, but all earnings are tax deferred.
                                                     Distributions are tax free if they are taken before age 30 and used for eligible
                                                       education expenses.
                                                     If the accumulated value in the account is not used by age 30, the funds must be
                                                       distributed and subject to income tax and a 10% penalty on the earnings or rolled
                                                       over into a different Coverdell ESA for another family member. Their definition of
                                                       family is extremely broad and, in addition to the obvious, includes cousins, aunts
                                                       and uncles, and even in-laws.

                                               PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   The maximum amount that may be invested in a Coverdell ESA in one year is
                                                    A. $500 per parent.
                                                    B. $2,000 per child.
                                                    C. $500 per couple.
                                                    D. $2,000 per couple.
                                                   Answer: B. Only $2,000 may be invested in each child’s ESA per year. If a couple has
                                                   three children, they may contribute $6,000 in total, or $2,000 per child, per year.

                                               TAKE NOTE
                                               A special-needs beneficiary has different rules. Contributions may be made after age
                                               18 and withdrawals may be delayed past age 30.


                                    Section 529 Plans
                                    Section 529 plans, legally known as qualified tuition programs (QTPs), are state-operated
                                    investment plans that were designed to give families a way to save money for college with
                                    substantial tax benefits. With the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, these plans
                                    extended the qualification to K–12 schooling as well. That change will be covered separately.
                                    There are two basic types of 529 plans: prepaid tuition plans and college savings plans.


                                    Prepaid Tuition Plans
                                    Prepaid tuition plans generally allow college savers to prepay for tuition at participating

                                                                                                                                                  Unit 18
                                    colleges and universities, and, in some cases, room and board can be prepaid as well. Most
                                    prepaid tuition plans are sponsored by state governments and have residency requirements.
                                    The basic concept is that if you pay for the tuition at today’s rates, the child will be able to
                                    attend in the future, regardless of how much higher the tuition is.


                                    College Savings Plans
                                    College savings plans generally permit the contributor, known as the account holder, to
                                    establish an account for a student (the beneficiary) for the purpose of paying the beneficiary’s
                                    qualified college expenses. The typical plan offers a number of investment options, including
                                    stock mutual funds, bond mutual funds, and money market funds. A very popular option is
                                    the age-based portfolio that automatically shifts toward more conservative investments as the
                                    beneficiary gets closer to college age. Withdrawals from college savings plans can generally
                                    be used at any college or university regardless of the state carrying the plan or the state of
                                    residence.

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                         One of your clients is a successful professional couple with earnings in excess
                                                         of $500,000 per year. They are interested in providing a funding source for
                                                         postsecondary education for their grandchildren. Which would be appropriate to
                                                         discuss with them?
                                                          A. The Coverdell ESA
                                                          B. The Section 529 plan
                                                          C. Both the Coverdell ESA and the Section 529 plan
                                                          D. Neither the Coverdell ESA nor the Section 529 plan
                                                         Answer: B. Although both plans will help them with their objective, their earnings
                                                         are above the Coverdell ESA limits, so choice B is the best answer.


                                        Tax Treatment of 529 Plans
                                        A major factor in investing in a 529 plan is tax benefits. Although contributions are made
                                        with after-tax money, earnings in 529 plans are not subject to federal tax and, in most cases,
                                        state tax, so long as withdrawals are for eligible college expenses, such as tuition and room and
                                        board and even a computer.

                                        However, money representing earnings that is withdrawn from a 529 plan for ineligible
                                        expenses will be subject to income tax and an additional 10% federal tax penalty. Unlike

                                    the IRS, many states offer deductions or credits against state income tax for investing in a
                                    529 plan. But eligibility for these benefits is generally limited to participants in a 529 plan
                                    sponsored by your state of residence.


                                    Withdrawal Restrictions
                                    Both plans place restrictions on withdrawals. With limited exceptions, you can only withdraw
                                    money that you invest in a 529 plan for eligible college expenses without incurring taxes
                                    and penalties. However, you can roll over any unused funds to a member of the beneficiary’s
                                    family without incurring any tax liability as long as the rollover is completed within 60 days

                                               The earnings portion of a nonqualified distribution is taxable to the individual who
                                               receives the payment, either the account owner or the designated beneficiary. If
                                               the payment is not made to the designated beneficiary or to an eligible educational
                                               institution for the benefit of the designated beneficiary, it will be deemed to have been
                                               made to the account owner.

                                               TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                               What if you don’t like the 529 plan you are invested in—can you make a change?
                                               Federal tax law allows a tax-free rollover of any or all of a 529 account from the current
                                               529 plan to a different 529 plan, but only once in any 12-month period unless there is a
                                               change in beneficiary. Just as with an IRA, if the proceeds are distributed, they must be
                                               reinvested in the new plan within 60 days. Therefore, assets in the QTP may be moved
                                               from the plan of one state to the plan of another no more frequently than once per 12
                                               months.

                                               TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                               As of the date of this question, there are more than 400 institutions of higher learning
                                               located outside of the United States where Section 529 plans (and Coverdell ESAs)
                                               may be used to pay qualified expenses. The expense for room and board (residence
                                               cost) qualifies only to the extent that it isn’t more than the greater of the following two
                                               amounts:
                                               1.   The allowance for room and board, as determined by the eligible educational
                                                    institution, that was included in the cost of attendance (for federal financial aid
                                                    purposes) for a particular academic period and living arrangement of the student;

                                                         operated by the eligible educational institution.


                                        Impact on Financial Eligibility
                                        Investing in a 529 plan (or Coverdell ESA) will generally impact a student’s eligibility to
                                        participate in need-based financial aid. Both types of plans are treated as parental assets in
                                        the calculation of the expected family contribution toward college costs regardless of whether
                                        the owner is the parent or the student. This computation is done on the FAFSA Form (Free
                                        Application for Federal Student Aid). Having money in a 529 plan is a better deal than if
                                        they were non-529 assets of the student, because parental assets are assessed on the FAFSA
                                        at a maximum 5.64% rate in determining the student’s expected family contribution (EFC)
                                        rather than the 20% rate on non-529 (or ESA) assets owned by the student, such as those in a
                                        UTMA account. These rates will not be tested, but the concept may be.


                                        Contributions to a 529 Plan
                                        Any adult can open a 529 plan for a future college student. The donor does not have to be
                                        related to the student.

                                        With a 529 plan, the donor can invest a small or substantial lump sum or make periodic
                                        payments. When the student is ready for college, the donor withdraws the amount
                                        needed to pay for qualified education expenses (e.g., tuition, room and board, and books).
                                        Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, but qualified withdrawals are exempt from
                                        federal taxation. As stated above, taxation varies from state to state. If any tax is due on
                                        withdrawal, it is the responsibility of the student, not the donor.

                                        A donor (typically a parent or grandparent) may contribute a maximum of $80,000
                                        ($160,000 if married) in a single year for each Section 529 plan beneficiary without gift tax
                                        consequences. This represents a five-year advance on the (2022) $16,000 per recipient annual
                                        gift tax exclusion.
                                        The donor of the 529 plan assets retains control of most 529 accounts and may take the
                                        money back at any time (although a 10% penalty tax may apply).

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    Although it probably won’t be tested, for those who bunch the annual gift exclusion
                                                    allowing five years’ worth at one time, this is not limited to one time per beneficiary.
                                                    If started with a one-year-old grandchild, the grandparents can do this again when
                                                    the child is six (five years have elapsed) and then again at 11, and so forth, as long as
                                                    the total contribution does not exceed the state’s limit. It surely would be nice to have
                                                    grandparents like that, wouldn’t it?

                                        These plans are considered “municipal fund securities” and, under the rules of the Municipal
                                        Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB), require delivery of an official statement, sometimes
                                        called an offering circular but never referred to as a prospectus on the exam.

                                        In general, these plans offer several different portfolio options, ranging from aggressive (for
                                        those with a longer time horizon) to guaranteed (for those in college using the funds). In most

                                    cases, these portfolios are registered mutual funds; in others, they are separately managed
                                    accounts containing stocks and/or bonds. Some portfolios include bank-insured CDs, and
                                    some of the states offer managed fixed-income pools.

                                              However, U.S. savings bonds are not available as investment options in Section 529
                                              plans.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              One significant difference between investments in an ESA and in a 529 is that the ESA
                                              functions like a self-directed IRA. That is, the investments are chosen at the discretion
                                              of the individual managing the account. In the case of the 529, you are limited to the
                                              choices offered by the plan.

                                    The rule permits K–12 withdrawals as qualified expenses for attendance at a public, private,
                                    or religious elementary or secondary school. The definition of qualified expenses for K–12 is
                                    $10,000 per student annually for tuition only.

                                    Qualified expenses include payment of interest or repayment of principal on qualified student

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              Key points to remember about Section 529 plans include the following:
                                               The dollar amount of allowable contribution varies from state to state and may be
                                                 as high as $500,000.
                                               Assets in the account remain under the donor’s control even after the student is of
                                                 legal age.
                                               There are no income limitations on donors making contributions to a 529 plan.
                                               Similar to Coverdell ESAs, these can be used for educational expenses incurred
                                                 below the postsecondary level (after high school), but with expense limitations.
                                               There are no age restrictions; that is, if at any age an individual desires to go back
                                                 to school, a 529 plan may be used.
                                               Earnings are exempt from federal taxes (as are withdrawals) if they go toward
                                                 qualified postsecondary educational expenses.
                                               Most states hire experienced investment management companies to manage
                                                 their accounts.
                                               In almost all cases, residents do not pay state income tax on qualified withdrawals
                                                 from home-state plans.
                                               In a majority of the states with an income tax, residents are afforded an income
                                                 tax deduction or credit for a portion of their contribution.
                                               If funds are withdrawn for purposes other than education, earnings are subject
                                                 to a 10% penalty as well as federal income tax. States may assess their own
                                                 penalties. The tax is the obligation of the distributee (student/beneficiary).
                                               A child can be a beneficiary of an ESA and a 529.

                                                     Because of their legal status as municipal fund securities, it is required that an
                                                       official statement or offering circular is delivered when opening a 529 plan account.

                                                         While in your office, you see that your firm is going to be holding a training session
                                                         on municipal fund securities. You wish to attend because you are interested in being

                                                          A. the difference between GO bonds and revenue bonds.
                                                          B. the difference between using mutual funds or UITs to invest in municipal

                                                          C. Section 529 plans.
                                                          D. Section 457 plans.
                                                         Answer: C. The Securities and Exchange Commission has stated that certain
                                                         Section 529 college savings plans established by states or local governmental entities
                                                         are municipal fund securities. Accordingly, the purchase and sale of state-sponsored
                                                         Section 529 plans are governed by the rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking
                                                         Board (MSRB).


                                                    KNOWLEDGE CHECK 18.6
                                                    1.   All of the following are characteristics of Section 529 savings plans except
                                                          A. contributions are deductible on the donor’s federal tax return.
                                                          B. contributions may be state tax deductible.
                                                          C. contributions grow tax deferred.
                                                          D. withdrawals are tax free if used for qualified education expenses.
                                                    2.   Two of the most popular methods for saving for education are the Coverdell ESA and
                                                         the Section 529 plan. Although there are many similarities, there are some significant
                                                         differences between the two. One of those differences is that the Section 529 plan
                                                           A. allows the funds to be used for any K–12 expense, while the ESA considers
                                                               tuition to be the only qualified expense.
                                                          B. has a federally imposed maximum annual contribution, while the ESA’s limit is
                                                               determined by each state.
                                                          C. places a limit on the age by which the funds may be used, while the ESA
                                                               permits the funds to be used by a beneficiary of any age.
                                                          D. does not place a limit on the earnings of the donor, while the ESA does place
                                                               such a limit.


          LESSON 18.7: CUSTODIAL ACCOUNTS AND HEALTH SAVINGS PLANS
                                        LO 18.i Contrast UGMA and UTMA accounts.

                                        Long before there were Education IRAs and Section 529 plans, a favored way of saving for a
                                        child’s education (or anything else for that matter) was by the use of a custodial account under
                                        the Uniform Gift to Minors Act. In a custodial account, the custodian for the beneficial
                                        owner enters all trades. UGMA and UTMA accounts require an adult or a trustee to act as
                                        custodian for a minor (the beneficial owner). Any kind of security or cash may be gifted to the
                                        account without limitation.

                                        The Uniform Law Commissioners adopted the Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA) in
                                        1956 (the same year as the Uniform Securities Act). The primary focus then was to provide a
                                        convenient way to make gifts of money and securities to minors. Later, it became clear that
                                        a more flexible law was desirable. The Uniform Law Commissioners adopted the Uniform

                                    Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) in 1986. UTMA expands the types of property you can
                                    transfer to a minor and provides that you can make other types of transfers besides gifts.

                                    Nearly all states have adopted UTMA, but people still tend to refer to UGMA out of habit.
                                    For exam purposes, it doesn’t matter which law is in effect in your state, because the essential
                                    principles of both acts are the same.


                                    Opening a UGMA/UTMA Account
                                    UGMA/UTMA account applications must contain the custodian’s name, minor’s name and
                                    Social Security number, and the state in which the UGMA/UTMA is registered.

                                              The minor’s Social Security number is used on the account.

                                    Securities in a UGMA/UTMA account are managed by a custodian until the minor reaches
                                    the age of majority or, in the case of a UTMA, the age determined by the specific state. The
                                    custodian has full control over the minor’s account and can:
                                     buy or sell securities;
                                     exercise rights or warrants; and

                                    The custodian also may use the property in the account in any way the custodian deems
                                    proper for the minor’s support, education, maintenance, general use, or benefit. However, the

                                    basic needs of food, clothing, and shelter.


                                    Fiduciary Responsibility
                                    A UGMA/UTMA custodian assumes fiduciary responsibilities in managing a minor’s account.
                                    Restrictions are placed on improper handling of investments in a UGMA/UTMA. The most
                                    important limitations follow:
                                     UGMAs/UTMAs may be opened and managed as cash accounts only.
                                     A custodian may never purchase securities on margin or pledge them as collateral for a
                                       loan.
                                     A custodian must reinvest all cash proceeds, dividends, and interest within a reasonable
                                       period of time. Cash proceeds may be held in an interest-bearing custodial account for a
                                       reasonable period.
                                     Investment decisions must consider a minor’s age and the custodial relationship; examples
                                       of inappropriate investments are commodity futures, naked options, and high-risk
                                       securities.
                                     Options may not be bought in a custodial account, because no evidence of ownership is
                                       issued to an options buyer.
                                     Covered call writing is normally allowed.
                                     Stock subscription rights or warrants must be either exercised or sold.

                                        A custodian may be reimbursed for any reasonable expenses incurred in managing the
                                        account. Compensation may be paid to the custodian unless the custodian is also the donor.


                                        Donating Securities
                                        When a person makes a gift of securities to a minor under the UGMA/UTMA laws, that
                                        person is the securities’ donor. A gift under UGMA/UTMA conveys an indefeasible title—
                                        that is, the donor may not take back the gift, nor may the minor return the gift until the
                                        minor has reached the age of majority. Once a gift is donated, the donor gives up all rights
                                        to the property. When the minor reaches the specified age, the property in the account is
                                        transferred into the minor’s name.


                                        UGMA/UTMA Rules
                                        Securities professionals should know the following UGMA/UTMA custodial account rules:
                                         All gifts are irrevocable. Gifts may be in the form of cash or fully paid securities.
                                         An account may have only one custodian and one minor or beneficial owner.
                                         A donor of securities can act as custodian or appoint someone to do so.
                                         Unless acting as a custodian, parents have no legal control over a UGMA/UTMA account
                                           or the securities in it.
                                         A minor can be the beneficiary of more than one account, and a person may serve as
                                           custodian for more than one UGMA/UTMA, provided each account benefits only one
                                           minor.
                                         The minor has the right to sue the custodian for improper actions.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    Although an investment adviser representative is not responsible for determining
                                                    whether an appointment is valid or a custodian’s activities are appropriate, he should
                                                    always be sensitive to the appearance of unethical behavior.

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                         If a customer would like to open a custodial UGMA or UTMA account for his nephew,
                                                         a minor, the uncle can
                                                           A. open the account, provided the proper trust arrangements are filed first.
                                                           B. open the account and name himself custodian.
                                                           C. open the account, but he needs a legal document evidencing the nephew’s
                                                                parents’ prior approval of the account.
                                                           D. be custodian for the account only if he is also the minor’s legal guardian.
                                                         Answer: B. The donor may name himself the custodian of a UGMA or UTMA account.
                                                         No documentation of custodial status is required to open these accounts, and the
                                                         custodian is not required to be the minor’s legal guardian.


                                        Registration of UGMA/UTMA Securities
                                        Any securities in a UGMA/UTMA account are generally registered in the custodian’s name
                                        for the benefit of the minor and cannot be solely in the minor’s name.

                                    So that transfers may be accomplished more expeditiously, securities may be held by
                                    custodians in street name.

                                               EXAMPLE
                                               In an account where Marilyn Johns, the donor, has appointed her daughter’s aunt,
                                               Barbara Wood, as custodian for the account of her minor daughter, Alexis, the account
                                               and the certificates would read “Barbara Wood as custodian for Alexis Johns” (or a
                                               variation of this form).
                                               When the minor reaches the age of transfer, all of the securities in the account are
                                               registered in her name. However, that change in registration is not automatic—the new
                                               adult must initiate the transfer.


                                    Death of the Minor or Custodian
                                    If the beneficiary of a UGMA/UTMA dies, the securities in the account pass to the minor’s
                                    estate, not to the parents or the custodian. If the custodian dies or resigns, either a court of
                                    law or the donor must appoint a new custodian.


                                    Unique Features of the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA)
                                    Account
                                    Although UTMA and UGMA accounts share many characteristics, there are a few important
                                    differences. First, although UGMA accounts may not hold real estate (real property), certain

                                                                                                                                                  Unit 18
                                    partnership interests, and other types of intangible property, UTMA accounts may. Thus,
                                    UTMA accounts offer greater investment choice.

                                    In many states, UTMA account assets are not required to be transferred upon the age of
                                    majority of the beneficial owner (the child). In many UTMA states, the custodian may
                                    delay transferring the UTMA assets to the beneficial owner until he reaches age 21 or 25
                                    (depending on the particular state statute).

                                               PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   One of the reasons you might suggest that a client with an eight-year-old child open
                                                   a UTMA account rather than a UGMA is that the UTMA offers
                                                     A. better tax advantages.
                                                    B. more investment flexibility.
                                                    C. more investment control to the parent.
                                                    D. greater flexibility in the appointment of a custodian.
                                                   Answer: B. There are two testable UTMA advantages:

                                                   1.   The money does not have to automatically transfer to the child once the age
                                                        of majority is reached—it can be delayed, depending on the state, until as
                                                        long as age 25; and
                                                   2.   The range of investments permitted under a UTMA is much larger, giving the
                                                        custodian greater flexibility in building the portfolio, which makes B the best
                                                        choice.
                                    There is a problem with this question (although not one recognized by NASAA)—you can’t
                                    select between a UTMA and a UGMA—clients can only use what is available in their state
                                    of residence. As of the print date, there is only one state remaining that has UGMA on their
                                    books; all of the rest plus Washington, D.C. use UTMA.

                                        Taxation
                                        The minor’s Social Security number appears on a UGMA/UTMA account, and the minor
                                        must file an annual income tax return and pay taxes on any earned income produced by the
                                        UGMA/UTMA account as would any other taxpayer. However, in the case of unearned
                                        income, such as from dividends and interest, until the minor reaches age 19 or the individual
                                        is a full-time student under 24, that unearned income in excess of $2,300 is taxed at the
                                        parent’s marginal tax rate. This is commonly referred to as the kiddie tax.

                                        Although the minor is the account’s beneficiary and is responsible for any and all taxes on the
                                        account, in most states it is the custodian’s responsibility to see that the taxes are paid from the
                                        account.


                                        FAFSA and Custodial Accounts
                                        In our discussion of educational funding programs, it was mentioned that money in Coverdell
                                        ESAs and Section 529 plans is only counted at a 5.64% rate when determining the family’s
                                        financial contribution toward college. Assets held in a custodial account (UTMA or UGMA)
                                        are counted at a 20% rate—a true disadvantage when compared to the other plans.


                                        LO 18.j Recall when health savings accounts (HSAs) may be used.


                                        Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)
                                        A health savings account (HSA) is a tax-exempt trust or custodial account that individuals can
                                        set up with a qualified HSA trustee to pay or reimburse certain medical expenses they incur.


                                        Benefits of an HSA
                                         You can claim a tax deduction for contributions you, or someone other than your
                                           employer, make to your HSA even if you do not itemize your deductions on Form 1040.
                                         Contributions to your HSA made by your employer (including contributions made
                                           through a cafeteria plan) may be excluded from your gross income.
                                         The contributions remain in your account until you use them.
                                         The interest or other earnings on the assets in the account are tax free.

                                         An HSA is portable—it stays with you if you change employers or leave the work force.


                                        Eligibility for an HSA
                                        To be an eligible individual and qualify for an HSA, you must meet the following
                                        requirements:
                                         You must be covered under a high-deductible health plan (HDHP) on the first day of
                                           the month. That means you are considered to be an eligible individual for the entire
                                           year if you are an eligible individual on the first day of the last month of your tax year
                                           (December 1 for most taxpayers).
                                         You have no other health coverage except what is permitted under the rules.
                                         You are not enrolled in Medicare.

                                     You cannot be claimed as a dependent on someone else’s tax return.
                                     Each spouse who is an eligible individual who wants an HSA must open a separate HSA.
                                       You cannot have a joint HSA.

                                    An HDHP has:
                                     A higher annual deductible than typical health plans; and
                                     A maximum limit on the sum of the annual deductible and out-of-pocket medical
                                       expenses that you must pay for covered expenses. Out-of-pocket expenses include
                                       copayments and other amounts but do not include premiums.


                                    Contributions to an HSA
                                    Any eligible individual can contribute to an HSA. For an employee’s HSA, the employee,
                                    the employee’s employer, or both may contribute to the employee’s HSA in the same year.
                                    For an HSA established by a self-employed (or unemployed) individual, the individual can
                                    contribute. Family members or any other person may also make contributions on behalf of
                                    an eligible individual. Contributions to an HSA must be made in cash, but the law permits
                                    investments to be made into stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Contributions of stock or
                                    property are not allowed. There is a limit on the amount that may be contributed, but,
                                    because it is a number that changes each year, it will not be tested. The only facts that could
                                    be important are that the contribution for those with family coverage is higher (logically)
                                    than that for self-only coverage and that the amount the individual may contribute is reduced
                                    by any amounts contributed by the employer. One number that does not seem to change
                                    annually is one that we learned earlier in this unit: Just as with IRAs, a catch-up contribution

                                                                                                                                                  Unit 18
                                    of an additional $1,000 is permitted, but in this case, the participant must be at least age 55.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              Do not confuse an HSA with an FSA (flexible spending account). The FSA holds money
                                              deducted from the employee’s pay and remains with the company—it is not investible,
                                              and, if you don’t use it, you lose it.


                                    Qualified Expenses
                                    Besides the cost of medical care, there are some insurance premiums that are considered
                                    qualified expenses. You can’t treat insurance premiums as qualified medical expenses unless the
                                    premiums are for any of the following:
                                     Long-term care insurance
                                     Health care continuation coverage (such as coverage under COBRA)

                                     Medicare and other health care coverage if you are 65 or older (other than premiums for a

             INTRODUCTION
                                    The concepts discussed in this unit are types of risk that both businesses and investors bear.
                                    Though not a comprehensive list, they are among the most common. Although we routinely
                                    use the term risk, we often have difficulty defining it precisely. In finance, risk is defined as
                                    the uncertainty that an investment will earn its expected rate of return. There are two basic
                                    categories of risk—systematic and unsystematic. We will address both of them and their
                                    subcategories one at a time.


             LESSON 19.1: INVESTMENTS ARE NOT WITHOUT RISK
                                    LO 19.a Identify the different systematic risks.

                                    Systematic risk is the risk in the return of an investment that is associated with the
                                    macroeconomic factors that affect all risky assets. Stated another way, systematic risk is the risk
                                    that changes in the overall economy will have an adverse effect on individual securities regardless
                                    of the company’s circumstances. It is generally caused by factors that affect all businesses, such
                                    as war, global security threats, or inflation. Primary examples would include market risk, interest



                                                                                                                                        479

                                        rate risk, and purchasing power risk, each of which will be dealt with separately. You might
                                        also see this referred to as nondiversifiable risk because, as we’ll learn, systematic risk cannot
                                        be avoided through diversification.


                                        Market Risk
                                        The first example of systematic risk that generally comes to mind is market risk. When the
                                        market tanks, virtually all securities lose value. This is a classic example of a nondiversifiable
                                        risk because, regardless of the number of different stocks in your portfolio, when you
                                        encounter a stock market such as we had in the first half of 2022 (reported by the Wall Street
                                        Journal as the worst performance for the S&P 500 since 1970), chances are most of those
                                        assets will have declined in price. In the next unit, we will discuss correlation. One way to
                                        protect against market risk is to have some negatively correlated securities in your portfolio.
                                        Those tend to go up when the others go down.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    Market risk is measured by a security’s beta (coming up in Lesson 20.4).

                                                    EXAMPLE
                                                    Should a war break out between two major oil-producing countries, the stock market
                                                    could decline dramatically. The stocks of individual companies would likely decline as
                                                    well, regardless of whether the war directly affected their businesses.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    Market risk cannot be diversified away. In Unit 21, we will discuss several strategies
                                                    that might be used to protect portfolios against this risk.


                                        Interest Rate Risk
                                        Interest rates fluctuate in the market all the time. If market conditions or the Federal Reserve
                                        push interest rates higher, the market price of fixed-income securities (bonds and preferred
                                        stock) will be affected. When interest rates rise, the market price of bonds falls; that is why
                                        this is a systematic risk. This risk is sometimes referred to as the market risk for bonds. Rising
                                        interest rates can be bearish for some common stock prices as well, particularly those of highly
                                        leveraged companies such as public utilities. Having a diversified portfolio of bonds won’t
                                        help, because an increase in interest rates will cause all bonds to decline in price. In Unit 21,
                                        we’ll discuss three strategies that may be used to reduce interest rate risk.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    Interest rate risk is intrinsic to all types of fixed-income investments, such as debt
                                                    securities and preferred stock, whether from an emerging market issuer or a triple-A
                                                    issuer. It is the risk that a security’s value will fluctuate as a result of a change in market
                                                    interest rates. This is known as the inverse relationship between interest rates and
                                                    the market price of a fixed-income security. That is, when interest rates move in one
                                                    direction, the price of those securities moves in the opposite direction. Specifically,
                                                    when interest rates increase, the market price of fixed-income securities declines. And,
                                                    when interest rates decline, the market price of fixed-income securities increases.

                                               EXAMPLE
                                               If the Federal Reserve increases interest rates dramatically, the market price of all
                                               bonds, regardless of credit quality, will decline.


                                    Reinvestment Risk
                                    A variation of interest rate risk is reinvestment risk. There is reinvestment risk as to interest
                                    and reinvestment risk as to principal.

                                    An investor receiving a periodic cash flow from an investment, such as interest on a debt
                                    security, may be unable to reinvest the income at the same rate as the security itself is paying.
                                    For example, if an investor purchased a bond with a 10% coupon and several years later
                                    comparable securities were only paying 7%, the investor would not be able to compound the
                                    investment at the original rate. Zero-coupon bonds avoid this risk because there is nothing to
                                    reinvest.

                                    This risk also occurs at maturity. If the fixed-income investor was enjoying a 10% return on
                                    the above bond, when it matured, the investor would only be able to reinvest the principal
                                    in a 7% security. That is one of the advantages of purchasing bonds with a longer term to
                                    maturity—you’re assured the fixed return for that length.


                                    Inflation Risk (Purchasing Power Risk)
                                    This is another systematic risk. Inflation reduces the buying power of a dollar (or whatever
                                    currency is used where you live). A modest amount of inflation is inherent in a healthy,
                                    growing economy, but uncontrolled inflation causes uncertainty among individual investors
                                    as well as corporate managers attempting to evaluate potential returns from projects. Treasury
                                    Inflation Protection Securities (TIPS) are one investment vehicle designed to protect against
                                    inflation risk.

                                    Fixed-income securities, such as bonds and preferred stock, are the most vulnerable to this
                                    risk; common stock is historically the least susceptible. In Unit 5 of this course, we learned
                                    that tangible assets, such as real estate and precious metals like gold, are also good inflation
                                    hedges.



                                                                                                                                                    Unit 19
                                               EXAMPLE
                                               As we stated, purchasing power risk is a systematic risk, meaning that diversifying your
                                               portfolio is of little or no help. Let’s assume that an individual nearing retirement took
                                               $1 million and, seeking income with safety, invested $100,000 into each of 10 different
                                               corporate bonds, all maturing in 20 years. For sure, this diversification does give
                                               protection against financial risk (if one of the bonds defaults due to bankruptcy of the
                                               issuer, the other nine should still pay off). However, if the cost of living rises, 20 years
                                               from now, when each of those bonds pays back the $100,000 principal, the investor
                                               will have $1 million, but how much will that $1 million purchase compared to what it
                                               would have 20 years earlier?

                                        Exchange Rate or Currency Risk
                                        Purchasers of foreign securities, whether through direct ownership or ADRs, face the
                                        uncertainty that the value of either the foreign currency or the domestic currency will
                                        fluctuate. For example, let’s say that the British pound (£) is up about 5% against the
                                        U.S. dollar in the past 12 months. As a result, someone who invested one year ago in the
                                        stock of a company domiciled in Great Britain will find that even if the stock has remained
                                        level or slightly lower on its local market, in terms of dollars, the value has increased. On
                                        the other hand, if your funds are in domestic cash or cash equivalents, you have little if any
                                        exposure to currency or exchange rate risk.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    On an individual level, the exam may even ask you about exchange rates and
                                                    vacationers. For example, you take a trip to Country A and purchase a dinner on your
                                                    credit card for 200 units of the local currency. Then, on the final night of your stay, you
                                                    go to the same restaurant, order the same meal, and, once again, the bill is for 200
                                                    units. When you get home, you check your credit card statement and see that you were
                                                    billed $100 for the first meal and $110 for the second. What happened? The value of the
                                                    foreign currency rose against the U.S. dollar from $.50 ($100/200) to $.55 ($110/200).
                                                    Even though no prices changed in the foreign country, you encountered currency risk.



                                        LO 19.b Identify the different unsystematic risks.

                                        Unlike systematic risk, which is nondiversifiable, unsystematic risks can be reduced through
                                        diversification. They are risks that are unique to the specific industry or business enterprise
                                        and would include things such as labor union strikes, lawsuits, and product failure. These are
                                        sometimes called nonsystematic risks. We will cover the most testable examples below.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    Several of these risks were covered in LO 5.g. You might want to review them.


                                        Business Risk
                                        This is an operating risk, generally caused by poor management decisions (e.g., Edsel, New
                                        Coke, or, more recently, RIMM failing to pay attention to the success of the iPhone—
                                        remember when everybody had to have a Blackberry?). At best, earnings are lowered; at
                                        worst, the company goes out of business and common stockholders probably lose their entire
                                        investment.


                                        Financial Risk
                                        Often confused with business risk (it is similar), financial risk relates primarily to those
                                        companies that use debt financing (leverage). An inability to meet those debt obligations
                                        could lead to bankruptcy and, once again, total loss for the stockholders. For that reason, this
                                        is sometimes called credit risk or default risk.

                                               TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                               Unsystematic risk can be minimized through portfolio diversification. For example, a
                                               client long 1,000 shares of XYZ selling those shares and investing the proceeds into an
                                               S&P index fund eliminates (or greatly reduces) business risk (but not market risk). In
                                               similar fashion, owning a diversified portfolio of bonds, such as is offered in a bond
                                               fund, offers protection against financial risk.

                                               TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                               Business risk is highest for investors whose portfolios contain stock in only one issuer
                                               or in lower rated bonds.


                                    Regulatory Risk
                                    A sudden change in the regulatory climate can have a dramatic effect on the performance or
                                    risk of a business and entire business sectors. Overreaching bureaucrats and court judgments
                                    that change the rules a business must comply with can devastate individual companies
                                    and industries almost overnight. A very common example of this is rulings by the EPA
                                    (Environmental Protection Agency), which can sometime play havoc with the oil and gas
                                    industry.


                                    Legislative Risk
                                    It is common to lump together regulatory and legislative risk, but there is a difference.
                                    Whereas regulatory risk comes from a change in regulations, legislative risk results from a
                                    change in the law. And, because there is frequently a political agenda behind legislation, this
                                    risk is sometimes referred to as political risk, although most consider political risk to be of its
                                    own making. A governmental agency, state or federal, may pass certain regulations, but only a
                                    legislature can pass a law. Changes to the tax code are the most obvious legislative risks.


                                    Political Risk
                                    It might seem like we are splitting hairs here, but each of these, although potentially
                                    interrelated, does have a different basis in the source of the risk. In the case of political risk,
                                    most attribute this to potential instability in the political underpinnings of the country (think

                                                                                                                                                 Unit 19
                                    of a coup). This is particularly true in emerging economies, but, as history has shown, political
                                    insurrections can occur even in highly developed societies. Please note that many (but not the
                                    folks who author the exam questions) consider this to be a systematic risk.


                                    Sovereign Risk
                                    Sovereign risk ratings capture the risk of a country defaulting on its commercial debt
                                    obligations. Headlines were made several years ago when the credit rating of the United States
                                    was reduced from AAA (at the time of this printing, the United States was back up to AAA).
                                    That is an example of the perceived increased sovereign risk that existed at the time. More
                                    recent examples with Greece point out that even countries can have difficulty paying their
                                    obligations.

                                        Country Risk
                                        Country risk monitors the political and economic stability of countries. Country risk is the
                                        total risk of investing in the obligations of that country and includes political, financial, and
                                        sovereign risk.

                                                    EXAMPLE
                                                    Investments that could be affected by regulatory changes include so-called green
                                                    industries (and those that tend to pollute), oil and gas exploration, airlines, and
                                                    pharmaceutical manufacturers. The most common regulatory risk comes from
                                                    governmental agency attempts to control or influence product prices or the
                                                    competitive structure of a particular industry through the passage and enforcement of
                                                    regulations.

                                                    EXAMPLE
                                                    An example of legislative risk is how the domestic boat-building business in the United
                                                    States was nearly wiped out in the early 1990s after the government instituted a luxury
                                                    tax for yacht purchases.

                                                    EXAMPLE
                                                    An example of political risk was the actions of the Chavez government in Venezuela
                                                    several years ago, where nationalization took place in many industries from cement
                                                    to supermarkets. Those investors in what were previously privately owned (not
                                                    government) businesses saw much, if not all, of their investment lost.


                                        Liquidity Risk
                                        Liquidity measures the speed or ease of converting an investment into cash without causing
                                        a price disruption. Liquidity risk is the risk that when an investor wishes to dispose of an
                                        investment, no one will be willing to buy it, or that a very large purchase or sale would not be
                                        possible at the current price. Although there is technically a difference, for exam purposes, you
                                        may also refer to this as marketability risk.

                                                    EXAMPLE
                                                    The Treasury bill market is a highly liquid market because investors can sell a Treasury
                                                    bill within seconds at the quoted prices. Real estate investments, however, can take
                                                    months or years to sell if you want to get close to your asking price. The longer it takes
                                                    to convert an investment into cash without having a fire sale, the greater the liquidity
                                                    risk.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    Listed stocks and mutual funds have virtually no liquidity risk. Thinly traded stocks,
                                                    many municipal bonds, and most tangible assets have a greater degree of inability to
                                                    liquidate rapidly at your price.

                                    Opportunity Cost
                                    Opportunity cost is the foregone return, or the return given up, on an alternative investment.
                                    In economic terms, opportunity cost is defined as the highest valued alternative that must
                                    be sacrificed as a result of choosing among alternatives. More simply, one can invest in
                                    short-term Treasury bills incurring virtually no risk. That is the risk-free alternative that
                                    can be earned by basically doing nothing. Any return that deviates from the risk-free return
                                    represents your opportunity gained or lost.

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              Assume the 91-day Treasury bill is currently yielding 6%. An investor decides to
                                              purchase a stock with an expected return of 11%. If that stock actually returns 2%, the
                                              opportunity cost is 4% (6% − 2%) because that is the rate that the investor gave up,
                                              risk free, to assume the risk of investing in the alternative choice.

                                                    KNOWLEDGE CHECK 19.1
                                                    1.      Of the many different types of risk faced by investors in securities, the systematic risk
                                                            that first comes to mind for most is
                                                              A. inflation risk.

                                                    2.      If a sovereign government enacted legislation that prohibited the sale of a certain

          LESSON 19.2: LIQUIDATION PRIORITY
                                        LO 19.d Recall the sequence of priority of claims in the event of a
                                        corporate liquidation.


                                        Liquidation Priority
                                        As discussed previously in Unit 7, a corporation’s capital structure is the way it raises its
                                        capital. Think of it like the building blocks of the company. All corporations build the base,
                                        as it were, with common stock. They may or may not issue preferred stock. If they wish to
                                        employ leverage, they will borrow money by issuing debt securities. Those securities may be
                                        issued with collateral, such as a mortgage bond, or merely on the general credit of the issuer
                                        (a debenture). In terms of looking at risks, it is critical to understand where the investor’s
                                        position is in the event of a bankruptcy.

                                        When examining the capital structure of a corporation, it is important to know the
                                        liquidation priority:
                                         Secured creditors (e.g., mortgage bonds, equipment trust certificates, collateral trust
                                           bonds). These may be called senior debt or even senior notes on the exam.
                                         Unsecured creditors (e.g., general creditors, including debenture holders)

                                         Preferred stockholders

                                    Regardless of how low on the totem pole a debt security is, such as a subordinated debenture,
                                    it still has priority in terms of payment of interest and principal ahead of any equity security.
                                    Look for a question asking, in essence, “In the event of a corporate liquidation, who comes
                                    first: A senior prior lien preferred stock or a junior unsecured subordinated debenture?” Now,
                                    you may not see all of those adjectives, but no matter what, a debt security always has priority
                                    over an equity security.

                                              If an exam question includes taxes and wages, those would have the highest priority of
                                              the unsecured creditors but would be behind those who are secured.

             INTRODUCTION
                                    Analytical methods primarily involve mathematical concepts in an attempt to assist in making
                                    better investment decisions. Because the testing center only permits the use of a simple
                                    four-function calculator, any computations you will be asked to perform will be relatively
                                    straightforward. In general, it will be more important to understand the concept than do the
                                    computation.

          LESSON 20.1: TIME VALUE OF MONEY
                                       LO 20.a Describe the different time value concepts including use of
                                       the rule of 72 to determine the return on an investment.

                                       There is no question that investing is a numbers business. In Unit 7, we discussed financial
                                       statements as a tool for evaluating a company, and those are almost entirely number oriented.
                                       In this unit, we’ll go further by looking at both the overall market and examine some of the
                                       tools that quantitative analysts (known as “quants” in the industry) use to assist them in
                                       making investment decisions. The first place to start is understanding that “time is money.”


                                       Time Value of Money
                                       We’ve all heard the famous saying, “time is money.” The concept certainly applies to
                                       investments. For example, if a person promises to pay a certain sum 10 years from now, what
                                       is it worth to have the money today so that the investor will have use of it over the next 10
                                       years instead of having to wait? If the investor could earn 10% on the money, compounded
                                       annually, having about $38.55 today would be equivalent in value to receiving $100 in 10
                                       years. That is known as the present value of a future sum. The second view of time value relates
                                       to computing the amount necessary to be invested today, using an assumed rate of return, so
                                       that it will have a defined amount in the future. Using the above case, if the investor were to
                                       invest $38.55 today and earn 10% compounded annually, he would have $100 in 10 years.
                                       We call that the future value computation.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     Although this can be proven in less than 10 seconds using a financial calculator,
                                                     you may have to do a compound return computation on the exam but won’t have
                                                     the benefit of such a fancy tool. Using the basic four-function calculator issued at
                                                     the testing center, you would take the initial $38.55 and multiply that by 110% and
                                                     continue to do that for a total of 10 times. We’ll just get you started to show you what it
                                                     looks like:
                                                     38.55 × 110% = 42.405 × 110% = 46.6455 × 110% = 51.31 and so forth, seven more
                                                     times, will get to you approximately 100.00. This is the same concept we will show you
                                                     with the TIPS bond in Unit 22.


                                       Future Value
                                       Future value is the formal term that indicates what an amount invested today at a given rate
                                       will be worth at some period in the future. The future value of a dollar invested today depends
                                       on the:
                                        rate of return it earns (r); and
                                        number of years over which it is invested (n).
                                       The equation to calculate the FV of an investment is expressed as:

                                                                                   FV = PV × (1 + r)n

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              In these two examples, we will demonstrate how these values are calculated. However,
                                              you will not be required to know the formula or how to do these computations.
                                              Assuming we invest $11,348.54 today and expect to earn 12% compounded annually
                                              for five years, what will it be worth then? Its future value is calculated using the above
                                              formula as follows:
                                              FV = $11,348.54 (the PV) × 1.125 = $20,000
                                              The future value expressed here reflects a compound rate of return on the original
                                              $11,348.54 invested. The compound return assumes that the interest earned (12% in
                                              this case) in a given period (five years) is reinvested at the identical rate for the number
                                              of years in which it is invested.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              To find PV, you must already know the FV.
                                              To find FV, you must already know the PV.


                                    Present Value
                                    Present value is the formal term for value today of the future cash flows of an investment
                                    discounted at a specified interest rate to determine the present worth of those future cash
                                    flows.

                                    Intuitively, investors recognize that a dollar in hand is worth more than a dollar in the future.
                                    The difference between the value today and sometime in the future is a function of the time
                                    elapsed and the rate of interest earned.

                                    The formula used to calculate present value is as follows:

                                                                            PV = FV ÷ (1 + r)n
                                    In the formula above, PV stands for the present value, FV stands for the future value, r is the
                                    interest rate, and n is the number of time periods the money is compounded.

                                    This formula says that the present value (PV) of an investment equals the investment’s future
                                    value (FV) discounted at (divided by) an interest rate over a time period specified by n. The
                                    factor (1 + r)n is known as the discount factor.

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              What is the present value of $20,000 that will be received 5 years (n) from today? If the
                                              investor requires a 12% return (r) for the $20,000, the value of that $20,000 today (PV)
                                              to be received in 5 years is calculated as follows:

                                                                                FV      $20, 000
                                                                      PV = ​​___5 ​​= ​​_ ​​= ($11, 348.54)

                                              formula or perform this calculation. You will be expected to understand the concept of

                                                     TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                     When computing present value (or future value), we are using an estimated rate of
                                                     return. What happens if the actual return is different from the estimated? If our actual
                                                     return is less, we don’t make out as well. That means that the present value (the
                                                     required initial deposit) is going to be higher than we computed. On the other hand, if
                                                     the actual return was higher than the present value (we did better than we thought),
                                                     the present value (the amount we would have had to deposit) is less.
                                                     The same logic holds true for future value. If the actual return is higher than projected,
                                                     the future value will be higher (we made more on our money than we thought we
                                                     would). Logically, if the actual return is lower, our future value winds up lower.

                                                     PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                         Present value is a computation that is frequently used to determine the amount of a
                                                         deposit needed now to meet a future need, such as college education. If an investor
                                                         uses an expected return of 8% but the actual return over the period is 10%, the future
                                                         value will be
                                                          A. lower than anticipated.
                                                          B. higher than anticipated.
                                                          C. the same as anticipated.
                                                          D. too varying to tell.
                                                         Answer: B. Present value is the amount deposited to meet a future goal based on an
                                                         expected rate of return. If the return is higher than expected, the ending result will be
                                                         greater (a good thing).


                                       Rule of 72
                                       The rule of 72 is a shortcut method for determining the number of years it takes for an
                                       investment to double in value, assuming compounded earnings. To find the number of years
                                       for an investment to double, simply divide the number 72 by the interest rate the investment
                                       pays. For example, an investment of $2,000 earning 6% will double in 12 years (72 ÷ 6 = 12).

                                       Here is another example of the rule of 72. A savings account with $1,000 in it bearing 4%
                                       compounded per year in interest would double (i.e., the account would be worth $2,000) in
                                       18 years: 72 ÷ 4 = 18.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     Suppose an investment of $1,000 was worth $4,000 in 16 years. Under the rule of 72,
                                                     what is the compounded earnings rate?
                                                     You figure this by realizing that the account has quadrupled—that means it has
                                                     doubled twice. So, if it took 16 years to double twice, it takes 8 years to double one
                                                     time. Dividing 72 by 8 tells us that our account must be earning 9%.

                                       The rule of 72 also works in reverse; that is, if you know the number of years you have, you
                                       can compute the required earnings rate to double by once again using 72 as the numerator
                                       and this time the number of years as the denominator. For example, if you have nine years
                                       before your child is going to enter college, what will you have to earn in order for a deposit
                                       made today to double? Simply divide 72 by 9, and the result is that an 8% earnings rate will
                                       have your money double.

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              An advisory client’s oldest child is 8 years old. With an expected college entry at age
                                              18, a need of $200,000, and a projected earning rate of 7.2%, what is the present value
                                              needed to accomplish the client’s goal?
                                              Using the rule of 72, we divide 72 by the 10 years before the money is needed (child’s
                                              age is 8 and college starts at 18) and see that money will double if the earnings rate is
                                              7.2%. That matches the projected rate, so any deposit today (the present value) will
                                              double by the time the funds are needed. A deposit of $100,000 today will be worth
                                              $200,000 in 10 years. Is this a guarantee? Of course not; but using the rule of 72 is a
                                              quick and easy way to approximate the funds needed for a future event.


                                    Net Present Value (NPV)
                                    Net present value (NPV) is the difference between an investment’s present value and its
                                    contemporaneous cost (current market value, or CMV). A positive NPV of $10 means that an
                                    investment selling for $100 must have a discounted present value (PV) of $110 for an NPV
                                    of $10. Note that the difference between the CMV ($100) and the PV of the investment’s
                                    future returns ($110) equals the NPV ($10). If the PV is $90, there is a negative NPV of $10
                                    because the price is above the present value.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              NPV is expressed in dollar amounts and not as a rate of return.

                                    An investment adviser could use the NPV concept to evaluate a client’s investment in any
                                    investment vehicle with a projected income stream. The adviser would project the cash flows
                                    from the investment and then discount them to their present value at the investor’s required
                                    rate of return. If the NPV is positive, the investment is a worthwhile addition to the investor’s
                                    portfolio.

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              This concept is very important on the exam (at least two or three questions worth), so
                                              let’s try to make it as simple as possible. Don’t worry about how we got the following
                                              numbers—that won’t be tested. What will be tested is understanding what they mean.
                                              Several years ago, the XYZ Corporation issued a bond with a nominal yield (interest
                                              rate) of 5% per year. The bond matures in exactly 20 years. As of the date of this
                                              example, comparable bonds are being issued with nominal rates of 4%. In this type of
                                              computation, the required rate of return = the current market rate (which is 4%). Using
                                              a financial calculator (which, as stated before, you won’t have at the test center), the
                                              present value (PV) of this bond (using these assumptions) is $1,136.78. I hope you are
                                              not surprised that this bond’s expected value is above the $1,000. After all, we learned
                                              in Unit 2 that when interest rates decline, the price of outstanding bonds increases.
                                              Now, here is where we get to the critical test question: If this bond is currently
                                              available from your broker-dealer for $1,100, what is its NPV? The answer is $36.78,

                                                                                                                                                  Unit 20
                                              because NPV is computed by subtracting the market price from the PV ($1,136.78 −
                                              $1,100). In this case, we have a positive NPV, and that means we’re able to buy the
                                              bond for less than what it is theoretically worth. If, on the other hand, the bond was
                                              available for $1,150, it would have a NPV of −$13.22 or a negative NPV and so would
                                              not be one you would likely purchase.

                                       Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
                                       The internal rate of return (IRR) is the discount rate (r) that makes the future value of an
                                       investment equal to its present value. The IRR can be thought of as the r in the present and
                                       future value calculations. The IRR is difficult to calculate directly; it must be determined by a
                                       trial-and-error process called iteration. IRR takes into consideration the time value of money.
                                       IRR is not practical for common stock due to uneven cash flow and no maturity date or price.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     The IRR calculation can be used to determine whether an investment meets the
                                                     investor’s required rate of return. If an investor requires an investment return of 10%
                                                     and the IRR for a proposed investment is 12%, the investor will view that investment as
                                                     attractive because it returns a higher rate than the investor’s required rate.

                                                     TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                     NPV and IRR are far and away the most difficult mathematical concepts you’ll
                                                     encounter on this exam. These are most important points to remember:
                                                      Internal rate of return (IRR) is the method of computing long-term returns that
                                                        takes into consideration time value of money.
                                                      The yield to maturity of a bond reflects its IRR.
                                                      The investment is a good one if it has a positive NPV; stay away if the NPV is
                                                        negative.
                                                      NPV is generally considered more important than IRR.
                                                      When an investment’s IRR is equal to the discount rate (sometimes called the
                                                        required rate of return), the NPV = zero. In an efficient market (Unit 21), bonds
                                                        should be priced so that their NPV is zero.
                                                      The quickest way to identify IRR versus NPV is that IRR is always expressed as a
                                                        percentage, while NPV never is. It is usually shown as a dollar amount. So, one is a
                                                        “rate” (%), while the other is a “value” ($).

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     Let’s go back to that NPV example to show you how IRR fits in. We established that the
                                                     required rate of return was one that equaled the market rate of 4%. If the XYZ bond in
                                                     our question was available from the broker-dealer at a price of $1,136.78, then its PV
                                                     and the market would be the same, giving us an NPV of zero. At that price, the bond’s

             LESSON 20.2: DURATION AND DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW
                                    LO 20.b Evaluate the effect of a bond’s duration on its market price.

                                    In the financial industry, the term duration is used to measure the sensitivity of a debt security
                                    when faced with changes in interest rates. The longer the duration, the greater the market
                                    price movement, and vice versa.

                                    It is a complicated computation, but, to try to simplify things, it is basically a measurement
                                    of the time it takes for the cash flow (interest payments) to repay the invested principal. That
                                    being the case, in general the higher the coupon rate, the shorter the duration, while the lower
                                    the coupon, the longer the duration.

                                    Just remember that there are two components to the computation: the interest rate and the
                                    maturity date. If the maturity dates are about the same (the difference between a 20-year
                                    maturity and a 22-year one is almost insignificant), then the bond paying the highest coupon
                                    rate will always have the shortest duration, and that with the lowest coupon, the longest
                                    duration. However, if the coupon rates are approximately the same, then the bond that will
                                    mature first will have the shortest duration, and the one that will mature last will have the
                                    longest duration.

                                    The way to compute the duration (calculation not tested) is to take the present value of a
                                    bond’s future cash flows (interest and repayment of principal) weighted by length of time to
                                    receipt and divided by the bond’s current market value. We’re talking about that same “present
                                    value” covered in the previous lesson. There, we learned that when a bond’s coupon rate
                                    was higher than the current market rate, the bond’s present value was greater than the face
                                    amount, and it should sell at a premium. Here, the effect of that higher present value results
                                    in a shorter duration and less market volatility.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              One way to keep things straight is to think about the zero-coupon bond. With no
                                              periodic interest payments (that’s why it’s called zero coupon), the duration of a zero-
                                              coupon bond will always equal its length to maturity. In other words, if we’re trying
                                              to compute how long it will take for the income payments to return your principal
                                              without any interest payments, you can’t expect to get your money back until the
                                              maturity date. If that is the case with a zero-coupon bond, then as we find bonds
                                              paying interest, the more they’re paying every six months, the quicker the payback.

                                                                                                                                                 Unit 20

                                                     If you were managing a portfolio of bonds and expected interest rates to decline (bond
                                                     prices would rise), you would lengthen the average duration of the portfolio. On the
                                                     other hand, if you were of the opinion that interest rates were going to rise (bond
                                                     prices would decline), you would want to shorten the average duration.

                                       You might be asked for the average duration of a group of bonds or a bond portfolio. The
                                       correct computation is too complicated for the four-function calculator you are given, but
                                       you’ll get the correct answer if you just find the average of the durations given. For example,
                                       the average duration of a portfolio whose individual bonds have durations of 3, 5, 7, and 17
                                       years is 8 years (3 + 5 + 7 + 17 = 32 divided by 4 = 8).

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     The duration of a bond with coupon payments is always shorter than the maturity
                                                     of the bond. By the same token, the duration of a zero-coupon bond is equal to its
                                                     maturity.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     A five-year zero-coupon bond has a duration of five because it takes five years to make
                                                     the money back; the buyer gets a single payment (par) at maturity five years after
                                                     purchase.

                                                     PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                         Being concerned about price volatility, a bond investor wishes to compute the
                                                         duration of a bond being considered for her portfolio. Which of the following is not a
                                                         necessary component of that calculation?
                                                          A. Coupon rate
                                                          B. Current market price
                                                          C. Rating of the bond
                                                          D. Time until maturity
                                                         Answer: C. Although it is true that lower-rated bonds tend to have greater price
                                                         volatility than high-rated ones, the rating has nothing to do with the calculation
                                                         of the bond’s duration, so our exception here is choice C. Duration is simply the
                                                         weighted average of the cash flows an investor will receive over time discounted to
                                                         the bond’s present value. Those cash flows come from the coupon and the return of
                                                         the par value at maturity.

                                    If you took geometry in school, you learned that curves could be convex (bulging to the
                                    outside) or concave (curving to the inside). It’s been over 65 years, but I still remember the
                                    key to the difference by the statement, “You can hide in a cave.” Now, what does that have to
                                    do with our discussion?

                                    Convexity is the measurement of the curve that results when plotting a bond’s price
                                    movements in response to changes in interest rates. It is a more accurate representation than
                                    duration of what will happen to a bond’s price as interest rates change, especially when the
                                    changes are great. Should you have a question about convexity on your exam, here’s what you
                                    have to know:
                                     Duration is a linear (straight-line) measurement, while convexity follows a curve.
                                     Comparing two bonds, the one with the higher convexity will show a greater price
                                       increase when yields fall and a smaller decrease when yields rise (that is a good thing).
                                     If we find two bonds with the same duration, the one with the higher convexity offers
                                       greater interest rate risk protection.

                                              If you should be asked, “Which of the following is the most useful in determining the
                                              price volatility of a bond to a significant change in interest rates?,” the correct choice is
                                              convexity.



                                    LO 20.c Describe how discounted cash flow is used to estimate the
                                    value of an investment.

                                    One way of assessing the value of a fixed-income security is by looking at the future
                                    expected free cash flow (the interest payments plus the eventual return of the principal) and
                                    discounting it to arrive at a present value. In its simplest iteration, this is nothing more than
                                    taking the all the money you are scheduled to receive over a given future period and adjusting
                                    that for the time value of money. The concept is used as well in some equity projections, such
                                    as the dividend discount and dividend growth models described previously. Therefore, in
                                    order to compute the future value of the cash flow from a bond, you would have to know the:
                                     principal amount;
                                     coupon rate; and
                                     number of interest payments.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              The higher the discounted cash flow (DCF), the more valuable the investment.

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              There will be no computations regarding discounted cash flow, but there is a common
                                              example that may help you understand the concept better. We all wish we could be a
                                              winner of those huge Powerball or Mega Millions jackpots. Winners have the choice of
                                                                                                                                                     Unit 20
                                              receiving a series of payments over a number of years (about 29 currently) or taking
                                              the money in cash. If they take the cash, they’ll receive around 72% of the announced
                                              total prize. Why is there a difference? The cash represents the present value of those
                                              future payments, and that is why you get less by taking it now instead of over time.

                                                     In fact, years ago, when interest rates were higher than they are at the time of this
                                                     printing, the lump-sum payment was only about 60% of the “prize.” That is because
                                                     the higher the market interest rates, the higher the discount rate. This is the same
                                                     concept used in valuing a bond using DCF. When you buy a bond, you are expecting
                                                     semiannual interest payments (cash flow) until the maturity date. When you compare
                                                     those interest rates to the current market rates (the discount rate in the equation), you
                                                     get an idea of the fair value of the bond. To better help you understand, take a look at
                                                     this question.

                                                     PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                         A client interested in fixed income is viewing different bonds with the same rating and
                                                         a coupon of 6%. Using the discounted cash flow method, which bond should have
                                                         the highest market value?
                                                           A. 5-year maturity when the discount rate is 4%
                                                          B. 5-year maturity when the discount rate is 8%
                                                          C. 10-year maturity when the discount rate is 4%
                                                          D. 10-year maturity when the discount rate is 8%
                                                         Answer: C. Remember, the discount rate is just another way of stating the current
                                                         interest rate in the marketplace. If the discount rate is higher than the coupon rate,
                                                         the present value, the expected market price will be below par. Conversely, if the
                                                         discount rate is lower than the coupon rate, the present value will be above the par
                                                         value. Now, there is nothing new for you here—when the current interest rate in the
                                                         marketplace (that is what the discount rate represents) is less than the coupon, the
                                                         bond price is higher (as interest rates go down, bond prices go up). And, if the current
                                                         market interest rate is higher than the coupon rate, the bond’s price will be lower
                                                         (when interest rates increase, bond prices fall). That would narrow the choices to
                                                         the two 4% bonds. That is, a bond with a 6% coupon should sell at a premium when
                                                         current interest rates are at 4%; when interest rates are at 8%, the 6% bond should be
                                                         selling at a discount. Then, as we’ve just learned with duration, when interest rates
                                                         change, the longer the time to maturity, the greater the effect on the market price of
                                                         a bond.

                                                     PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                         An analyst would use the discounted cash flow method in an attempt to find the
                                                          A. fair value of a security.
                                                          B. the current market price of a security.
                                                          C. the current rate of return of a security.
                                                          D. the cash flow from operations.
                                                         Answer: A. DCF uses the present value of future cash flows, based on a specified
                                                         discount (interest) rate, to evaluate the price that a security should be selling for in
                                                         the market. If the current market price of the security is less than this value, it has a
                                                         positive net present value (NPV) and should be a good investment. The opposite is
                                                         true if there is a negative NPV (the market price is higher than that computed under
                                                         the DCF method).

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              Here is something that may help. The current rate of interest (the discount rate) on
                                              new AA rated bonds with a 20-year maturity is 4%. If you have an older AA bond with
                                              20 years until it matures and a coupon of 6%, how does all of this apply?
                                              If the yield to maturity (YTM) on your bond is 4.4%, it has a positive NPV (its yield is
                                              above the market rate of 4%, so this bond is selling at a price below its present value).
                                              If the YTM on your bond is 3.6%, it has a negative NPV (its yield is below the market
                                              rate of 4%, so this bond is selling at a price above its present value).
                                              If the YTM on your bond is 4%, it has a zero NPV (its yield is equal to the market rate of
                                              4%, so this bond is selling at its present value).

                                    One more point should be made on this topic. You might see the following statement as the
                                    definition of a bond’s yield to maturity: The yield to maturity is the discount rate that equates
                                    the present value of the bond’s future cash flows until maturity to its price.

                                    Unlike the other debt securities we’ve discussed, trying to project your client’s cash flow on a
                                    portfolio of mortgage-backed securities has its challenges. Although they do have default risk
                                    (other than GNMAs) as do other debt securities, the specific risk due to the possible (some
                                    would say likely) prepayments complicates the computation.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              When doing cash flow analysis on a mortgage-backed pass-through security, you
                                              would want to know the average maturities.
                                              You might want to go back and review the discussion of present value in Lesson 20.1.

                                       Measures of Central Tendency
                                       We are going to continue this section on quantitative measurements with a discussion dealing
                                       with the method of determining how one might approach figuring the logical outcome
                                       of a securities investment. Central tendency is usually defined as the center or middle of a
                                       distribution. There are many measures of central tendency. Let’s take a look at some of them.


                                       Mean or Arithmetic Mean
                                       When we use the word average, this is what we are really speaking about. Of all the different
                                       measures, this is the one most commonly used to measure central tendency. You’ve been
                                       computing this for years—all you do is take the sum of the variables and divide by the
                                       number of occurrences. For example, if a stock returned 5%, then 8%, then 9%, and then
                                       2%, the mean would be 6% (5 + 8 + 9 + 2 = 24 ÷ 4 = 6). Even though it is the most used
                                       (probably because it is so simple to do), the mean may not be an appropriate measure of
                                       central tendency for skewed distributions. The term mean by itself will always refer to the
                                       arithmetic mean.


                                       Geometric Mean
                                       This one takes some math skills and is, therefore, rarely used (and probably won’t be a correct
                                       choice on the exam and certainly not something you’ll have to compute). The geometric
                                       mean of any given set of numbers (n) is obtained by multiplying all of them together, and
                                       then taking the nth root of them. For example, over the past five years, a stock has annual
                                       returns of 10%, 5%, 15%, 8%, and 12%. Its geometric mean is 9.36%. This is computed by
                                       multiplying 10 × 5 × 15 × 8 × 12, which equals 72,000 and finding the 5th root.

                                       This is not to be confused with the more commonly used arithmetic mean, which, in this
                                       case, is 10 + 5 + 15 + 8 + 12 = 50 ÷ 5 = 10%.

                                                     When comparing the arithmetic mean to the geometric mean, the arithmetic mean
                                                     will always be higher, unless all of the numbers being used are the same (e.g., figuring
                                                     the mean of 6, 6, and 6), in which case they will be equal. The reason is because the
                                                     geometric mean uses imputed compounding.


                                       Median
                                       The median is a midpoint of a distribution—that is, there are as many variables below as there
                                       are above. To find the median of a number of returns, list them in order and then find the
                                       number in the middle. For example, the median of 11, 7, 4, 13, and 8 is 8 (4, 7, 8, 11, and
                                       13). If the number of variables is even, then take the average of the middle two. If we use the
                                       numbers given above for the mean (2, 5, 8, and 9), the average of the middle two is 6.5 (5 +
                                       8 = 13 ÷ 2 = 6.5). Note that the median is not the same number as the mean. The median is
                                       often more appropriate than the mean in skewed distributions or in situations with variables
                                       that fall far outside the normal range (outliers).

                                       Definition: skewed distributions. In a normal distribution, the mean and median are the
                                       same; nothing is skewed. This rarely happens. Most commonly, distributions of returns are
                                       skewed either to the left (the mean is lower than the median) or to the right (the mean is
                                       higher than the median).

                                    Mode
                                    The mode is determined much differently than the prior two. Mode measures the most
                                    common value in a distribution of numbers. For example, the mode of 2, 2, 2, 6, 7, 7, and
                                    9 is 2. The mode is likely to be quite unlike the mean or median. For example, using the
                                    numbers just shown, the mean is 5 (35 ÷ 7) and the median is 6.


                                    Range and Mid-Range
                                    Range is the difference between the highest and lowest returns in the sample being viewed.
                                    When there are many values at either extreme of the range, the results tend to be skewed in
                                    that direction. The simplest way to do this is to reorder the data set from smallest to largest
                                    and then subtract the first element from the last element. Some look at the mid-range value,
                                    which, as the name implies, is the number that is exactly in the middle of the range. That is
                                    calculated by adding the highest number to the lowest number and dividing by 2.

                                    For example, if we look at the numbers we used to determine the median above, we reorder
                                    the numbers: 4, 7, 8, 11, and 13. This makes the range 9 (13 − 4) and the mid-range is 8.5,
                                    close to but not the same as the median. How did we solve for the mid-range? Add the lowest
                                    number and the highest number in the series and divide by two (4 + 13 = 17 ÷ 2 = 8.5). Using
                                    our mode example, the range is 7 (9 −2) and the mid-range is 5.5 (2 + 9 = 11 ÷ 2 = 5.5).

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              Over the past seven years, a security has produced annual returns of 10%, 4%, –5%,
                                              10%, 12%, –2%, and 6%. In this example, the mean return (the average) is 5% (adding
                                              these seven returns totals 35% and dividing by seven results in an average of 5%). The
                                              median return, the one with as many returns above as below, is 6%. The mode, the
                                              return with the most occurrences, is 10%, and the range, the difference between the
                                              lowest and highest returns, is 17% (–5% to 12%).

                                                   An investor is looking at the past performance of a security over the past three
                                                   years. In year one, it returned 10%; in year two, it returned 15%; and in year three,
                                                   it returned –4%. This computes to an average rate of return of 7%. This would be
                                                   properly referred to as the

                                                   Answer: A. When a true average return is shown, that is the arithmetic mean. The
                                                   median return (the number in the middle of the group of three) is 10%, and the range
                                                   is 19% (–4 to 15).

                                                     You may have a question that shows four portfolios listing the mean, the median, and
                                                     the mode for each one. The question will ask: Which one had some investments that
                                                     significantly outperformed the average of the other investments? The answer will be
                                                     the one with the highest mean. To show how that works, let’s say that you have seven
                                                     securities in the portfolio with the following returns: A: 5%; B: 5%; C: 8%; D: 10%; E:
                                                     12%; F: 40%; and G: 60%. The mode (the number that appears the most frequently) is
                                                     5%. The median (the number with the same number of returns above and below it) is
                                                     10%, and the mean (the average of the seven returns) is 20% (140 ÷ 7). The two outliers
                                                     (F at 40% and G at 60%) caused the mean (average) to be significantly higher than the
                                                     mode or the median because those two performed significantly better than the other

                                                          that they have ranged from a high of 24% to a low of negative 2%. That would

          LESSON 20.4: MEASUREMENTS OF RETURN AND VOLATILITY
                                       LO 20.e Identify alpha and beta.


                                       Beta Coefficient
                                       Beta and beta coefficient mean the same thing. In the securities industry, coefficient is ordinarily
                                       dropped for purposes of convenience. Beta is used to measure the variability between a
                                       particular stock’s (or portfolio’s) movement and that of the market in general. A stock with
                                       a beta of 1.00 will tend to have a market risk similar to that of the market as a whole. Most
                                       frequently, beta is measured against the Standard & Poor’s 500 composite index. A stock
                                       with a beta of 1.50 will be considerably more volatile than the market; a stock with a beta of
                                       0.70 will be much less volatile than the market. Although most assets have a positive beta, it
                                       is possible to find some with a negative beta. Assets with a negative beta can be an important
                                       component when diversifying a portfolio. For example, if beta is −1.2, a 10% up move in
                                       the market’s return will cause the stock return to decline by 12%. On the other hand, if the
                                       general market were to suffer a decline, a stock with a negative beta would generally show
                                       positive returns. Know that conservative clients need securities with low positive betas,
                                       whereas aggressive clients will find betas in excess of 1.00 to be quite suitable. In the previous
                                       unit, we mentioned that beta is a measurement of systematic risk—specifically, market risk.

                                               If the S&P 500 rises or falls by 10%, a stock with a beta of 1 rises or falls by about 10%,
                                               a stock with a beta of 1.5 rises or falls by about 15%, and a stock with a beta of .75 rises
                                               or falls by about 7.5%.

                                                    D. cause the portfolio to experience more volatility in times of a declining market.
                                                   Answer: A. A negative beta means that the investment will move in an opposite
                                                   direction from the overall market. Therefore, if the market is declining, then the
                                                   asset should increase in value, thereby increasing the expected performance of the
                                                   portfolio.


                                    Alpha
                                    For portfolio managers, good news is when they can say that they have generated positive
                                    alpha. Basically, that means that their investment performance is better than what would have
                                    been anticipated, given the risk in terms of volatility that was taken. The expected return is
                                    usually determined using the capital asset pricing model (CAPM), which will be covered in
                                    Unit 21. That generally means the manager has been adept at security selection and timing.

                                    You may be asked to compute how much alpha was generated for a particular stock or
                                    portfolio based on the amount of risk taken. Alpha can be positive, negative, or zero. If the
                                    alpha is negative, then the portfolio is underperforming the market; if higher, the portfolio
                                    is outperforming the market (and the manager is doing a good job). Although the general
                                    calculation refers to the market, a deeper view compares the performance to the specific
                                    benchmark that is most similar to the portfolio. For example, a large-cap fund manager would
                                    use the S&P 500, not the Russell 2000 (small-cap index), return as the market return in the
                                    alpha calculation.

                                    The most common formula for computing alpha goes like this:
                                    (Actual portfolio return – risk-free rate) – (portfolio beta × [market return – risk-free rate])

                                    In essence, what is being done is comparing performance after eliminating the risk-free rate.

                                    This is one item it’s easier to understand if we show you the numbers.

                                    Definition: risk-free rate. The risk-free rate used on the exam will always be the 91-day (or
                                    13-week) U.S. Treasury bill. Because their price movements are not generally related to the
                                    stock market, those T-bills are said to have a beta of zero.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     Portfolio return 10%

                                                     Beta 1.2
                                                     The computation of alpha would be:
                                                     (10% – 2%) = 8%. Then (1.2 × [8 – 2]), which is 1.2 × 6 = 7.2. Plug that into the formula,
                                                     which gives us 8 – 7.2 or an alpha of 0.8 (positive alpha).

                                                     PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                         Portfolio return 10%
                                                         Risk-free rate 2%
                                                         Market return rate 8%
                                                         Beta 0.8
                                                         (10% – 2%) – (.8 × 6) = 8 – 4.8 = positive alpha of 3.2
                                                         Let’s review for a moment. Both portfolios earned the same 10%, but the second one
                                                         did it with a much lower beta—we would not have expected that portfolio to do as
                                                         well as the one with the higher beta (remember, more risk, more reward). The fact
                                                         that it did means the portfolio manager(s) did a great job.

                                                     TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                     It is possible on the exam that you will have an alpha computation where the RF (risk-free
                                                     return) is not given. In that case, the computation is the same but without the RF being
                                                     subtracted from both the actual return and the market return. For example, in our first
                                                     case, the computation would be 10% – (1.2 × 8%) or 10% – 9.6% for an alpha of .4.



                                       LO 20.f Recall how standard deviation relates to volatility.


                                       Standard Deviation
                                       Standard deviation is a measure of the volatility of an investment’s projected returns, computed
                                       by using historical performance data. Standard deviation is a statistical term that measures the
                                       amount of variability or dispersion around an average. The larger this dispersion or variability
                                       is, the higher the standard deviation. The higher the standard deviation, the larger the security’s
                                       returns are expected to deviate from its average return, and, hence, the greater the risk.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     This simple example should give you a basic understanding of the concept behind
                                                     using standard deviation as a tool to predict price volatility. Let’s compare the returns
                                                     generated by the common stock of two unrelated companies over the past three years.

                                              For an investor who held shares in Company A for those three years, the mean return
                                              on investment was 10%. This is calculated, just like any other average, by adding
                                              together the three annual returns (8 + 12 +10 = 30) and dividing that by 3.
                                              For an investor who held shares in Company B for those three years, the mean return
                                              on investment was exactly the same: 10% (25 + 9 – 4 = 30 ÷ 3). However, which one of
                                              the shares had a greater dispersion (or variance) from the mean? Clearly, Company B’s.
                                              You will not have to compute it, but you should be able to see from this that Company
                                              B would have a much higher standard deviation (its returns have deviated far greater
                                              from the average) than Company A. If you were asked on your exam to choose which
                                              of these two would be more suitable for the conservative investor (the one who likes
                                              to sleep well at night), you’d better pick Company A, the one with the lower standard
                                              deviation.

                                    Standard deviation is expressed in terms of percentage. It is generally accepted that a
                                    security will vary within one standard deviation about 68% of the time, within two standard
                                    deviations about 95% of the time, and within three standard deviations about 99% of the
                                    time. A standard deviation of 7.5 means that the return of a stock for a given period may vary
                                    by 7.5% above or below its predicted return about two-thirds of the time, within 15% about
                                    95% of the time, and within 22.5% about 99% of the time.

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              A security has an expected return of 12% and a standard deviation of 5%. Investing in
                                              a security with an expected 12% return, an investor can expect returns to range within
                                              7% to 17% about 68% of the time and within 2% to 22% about 95% of the time.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              An investor can use standard deviation to compare the volatility between investments.
                                              Simply put, the higher the standard deviation, the greater the volatility (and the
                                              reverse).

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              If an investor had a choice between an investment that historically returned 12% with
                                              a standard deviation of 6% and another investment that also returned 12% but had a
                                              standard deviation of 10%, the investor would probably choose the first one. In effect,
                                              he would expect to receive an equal return in the future return with less risk.


                                    Beta vs. Standard Deviation
                                    Beta is a volatility measure of a security compared with the overall market, measuring only
                                    systematic (market) risk. Standard deviation is a volatility measure of a security compared
                                    with its expected performance and includes both systematic and unsystematic risk. Another
                                    way to put that is that standard deviation measures the total risk of a security or portfolio.

                                    understanding of these two types of risk.

          LESSON 20.5: THE EFFECTS OF CORRELATION ON A PORTFOLIO’S
          RETURN
                                       LO 20.g Recognize the relationship between correlation and
                                       diversification.


                                       Correlation
                                       Correlation means that securities move in the same direction. A strong or perfect
                                       correlation means two securities prices move in a perfect positive linear relationship with each
                                       other.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     Two securities are correlated if one security’s price rises by 5% and the other security’s
                                                     price then rises by 5%, or if one declines by 4% and the other also declines by 4%.

                                       The correlation coefficient is a number that ranges from –1 to +1. Securities that are
                                       perfectly correlated have a correlation coefficient of +1. Securities whose price movements are
                                       unrelated to each other have a correlation coefficient of 0. If prices move in perfectly opposite
                                       directions, they are negatively correlated or have a correlation coefficient of –1. Generally
                                       speaking, correlation coefficients of .80 and up are considered to be a very high correlation.

                                       As previously mentioned in Lesson 17.3, one of the risks in investing in index funds is
                                       tracking error. When the correlation is no longer close to 1, the fund’s performance is unlikely
                                       to match the benchmark (it could be better or worse; it just is unlikely to match).

                                    Diversification
                                    Throughout this course, we have praised the benefits of diversification. Whether the
                                    discussion was about pooled investment vehicles such as mutual funds and REITs or
                                    alternative investments, spreading the risk among a number of different holdings, especially
                                    with different market characteristics, is a proven way of reducing unsystematic risk.

                                    There are several ways to diversify a portfolio. One of them, typically used in mutual funds,
                                    it to own a number of different securities. For example, a growth fund with be highly
                                    concentrated in common stock in companies in industries that have the potential for greater
                                    than average future growth. In this case, most of the securities in the portfolio will be highly
                                    correlated (they’ll tend to move in the same direction).

                                    Another way is to diversify by owning different types of assets. We have mentioned the topic
                                    of asset allocation previously and will delve further into it in the next unit. By investing in
                                    assets with a low or negative correlation, the investor benefits further from diversification
                                    because when there is a down market for equities, those assets with a negative correlation will
                                    have a tendency to provide positive returns.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              Index funds attempt to achieve perfect correlation (+1) with the index they are
                                              mirroring (e.g., the Standard & Poor’s 500). The goal of an index fund manager is to
                                              come as close as possible to matching the performance of the underlying index. It
                                              is not a goal to exceed the performance, but only to match it. An index fund may not
                                              perfectly track its index. For example, a fund may only invest in a sampling of the
                                              securities in the market index, in which case the fund’s performance may be less likely
                                              to match the index. This is known as tracking error.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              One of the best ways to increase the diversification of a portfolio is to include
                                              investments with a negative correlation. The logic is that those negatively correlated
                                              assets will go up when the rest of the portfolio is going down. One of the best
                                              examples of a negatively correlated asset is an investment in gold stocks. Bonds
                                              frequently have a negative correlation as well, which is one of the reasons for creating
                                              a balanced allocation.

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   Take a look at this example: One of your clients has a portfolio that has a correlation
                                                   of .91 with the overall market. A stock with which correlation coefficient would most
                                                   likely offer the greatest diversification to this client?

                                                   Answer: D. Remember, the best way to diversify is to include securities with a
                                                   negative correlation, and the only one here that meets that requirement is choice D.

                                                           A. The higher the correlation, the more diversified the portfolio.
                                                           B. The lower the correlation, the more diversified the portfolio.
                                                           C. When the correlation coefficient is zero, the portfolio is at its maximum
                                                              diversification.
                                                           D. Correlation is primarily used for individual investments rather than portfolios.
                                                     2.   An investor holds a portfolio in stocks that generally react in similar fashion to

          LESSON 20.6: FINANCIAL STATEMENT CALCULATIONS

                                       LO 20.h Calculate liquidity and valuation ratios of common stock.


                                       Using the Balance Sheet
                                       One of the key tools in fundamental analysis is the corporation’s financial statements. We have
                                       viewed the balance sheet and income statement in Unit 7 and now are going to focus on the
                                       most testable calculations derived from those documents. We will begin with the three ratios
                                       that evaluate liquidity as determined by examining the company’s balance sheet.


                                       Working Capital
                                       Working capital is the amount of capital or cash a company has available. Working capital is
                                       a measure of a firm’s liquidity, which is its ability to quickly turn assets into cash to meet its
                                       short-term obligations.

                                       The formula for working capital is:

                                       current assets – current liabilities = working capital

                                       Factors that increase working capital include increases in cash from:
                                        the sale of securities (long-term debt or equity);
                                        profits from the business operations; and
                                        the sale of noncurrent assets, such as equipment no longer in use.
                                       Factors that decrease working capital include increasing current liabilities such as:
                                        declaring cash dividends;
                                        paying off long-term debt at maturity or, if called, earlier; and
                                        net operating losses.

                                    Current Ratio
                                    Knowing the amount of working capital is useful, but it becomes an even better indicator
                                    when paired together with the current ratio. This computation uses the same two items,
                                    current assets and current liabilities, but expresses them as a ratio of one to the other. Simply
                                    divide the current assets by the current liabilities, and the higher the ratio, the more liquid the
                                    company is.


                                    Quick Asset Ratio (Acid Test Ratio)
                                    Sometimes it is important for the analyst to use an even stricter test of a company’s ability
                                    to meet its short-term obligations (as such, “pass the acid test”). The quick asset ratio uses
                                    the company’s quick assets instead of all of the current assets. Quick assets are current assets
                                    minus the inventory. Then divide these quick assets by the current liabilities to arrive at the
                                    quick ratio.

                                               TAKE NOTE
                                               Liquidity measures a company’s ability to pay the expenses associated with running
                                               the business.

                                               EXAMPLE
                                               As with most arithmetic, there are two ways to get to the correct answer. The standard
                                               formula for the quick asset ratio is the following: Current assets minus inventory
                                               divided by current liabilities. The same result is achieved by adding together all of the
                                               current assets except the inventory and then dividing by the current liabilities.

                                    Here are two additional computations relying on the balance sheet:


                                    Debt-to-Equity Ratio
                                    The best way to measure the amount of financial leverage being employed by the company
                                    is by calculating the debt-to-equity ratio. It is really a misnomer—it should be called the
                                    debt-to–total capitalization ratio because that is what it is. For example, using the numbers
                                    in the capitalization table below, we see that the total capital employed in the business is
                                    $90 million. Of that, $50 million is long-term debt. So, we want to know how much of the
                                    $90 million total is represented by debt capital. The answer is simple: $50 million of the
                                    $90 million, or 55.55%. That is the debt-to-equity ratio.

                                       Book Value Per Share
                                       A fundamental analyst is described as one who focuses on the company’s books. Therefore,
                                       one of the key numbers computed is the book value per share.

                                       In the case of a corporation, this is basically the liquidation value of the enterprise. That is,
                                       let’s assume we sold all of our assets, paid back everyone we owe, and then split what was left
                                       among the stockholders. But remember, before we can hand over anything to the common
                                       shareholders, we must take care of any outstanding preferred stock. So, from the funds that
                                       are left after we pay off all of the liabilities, we give the preferred shareholders back their par
                                       (or stated) value and the rest belongs to the common stockholders.

                                       But there is one more thing. In the case of liquidation, some of the assets on our books
                                       might not really be worth what we’re carrying them at. In particular, those that are known as
                                       intangible assets (goodwill, patents, trademarks, copyrights, etc.). That is why the analyst uses
                                       only the tangible assets, computed by subtracting those intangibles from the total assets.

                                       Expressed as a formula, book value per share is:

                                               Tangible assets ​– liabilities ​– par value of preferred

                                                     Book value reflects the theoretical liquidating value of the company, not its intrinsic
                                                     value. Fixed assets are shown at actual cost (the original purchase price) minus the
                                                     accumulated depreciation; their actual value may be higher or lower.


                                       Using the Income Statement
                                       There are a number of important ratios that can be computed using information from the
                                       income statement. We’ll take a look at several of them.


                                       Earnings Per Share (EPS)
                                       Among the most widely used statistics, EPS measures the value of a company’s earnings for
                                       each common share:

                                                       earnings available to common

                                                       number of shares outstanding
                                       Earnings available to common are the remaining earnings after the preferred dividend has
                                       been paid. Earnings per share relates to common stock only. Preferred stockholders have no
                                       claims to earnings beyond the stipulated preferred stock dividends.

                                    EPS after dilution assumes that all convertible securities, such as warrants and convertible
                                    bonds and preferred stock, have been converted into the common. Because of tax
                                    adjustments, the calculations for figuring EPS after dilution can be complicated and will not
                                    be tested.


                                    Current Yield (Dividend Yield)
                                    A common stock’s current yield expresses the annual dividend payout as a percentage of the
                                    current stock price:

                                                            annual dividends per common share

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              LMN Corporation pays a quarterly dividend on its common stock of $.50 per share. If
                                              the current market price of LMN common stock is $80 per share, what is the current
                                              yield? The first step is to recognize that quarterly dividends of $.50 total $2.00 annually.
                                              Then, we plug the numbers into the formula:
                                              $2.00 = 0.025 or 2.5% current yield
                                              One way to remember this is that we are computing the return on $80.00, your
                                              investment. So, take the return ($2) and put it “on” your investment ($80).

                                       In general, older, well-established companies pay out larger percentages of earnings as
                                       dividends. Utilities as a group have an especially high payout ratio. Growth companies
                                       normally have the lowest ratios because they reinvest their earnings in the businesses.
                                       Companies on the way up hope to reward stockholders with gains in the stock value rather
                                       than with high dividend income.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     Using the simple income statement above, we see that the company paid dividends of
                                                     $1.00 per share out of the earnings of $1.45 per share. That is a ratio of approximately
                                                     68.97%. Simply, the computation is “dividends paid over (divided by) earnings made.”
                                                     It can be shown as total dividends and total net income (in our income statement, that
                                                     would be $1.0 million ÷ $1.45 million) or as dividends per share and earnings per share
                                                     ($1.00 ÷ $1.45). It is the same 68.97% either way.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     In our income statement, we see that the earnings per share are $1.45. If the stock’s
                                                     current market price is $29, what is the P/E ratio? Simply take the price (29) and place
                                                     it “on” the earnings (1.45), and that computes to 20. So, we say the P/E ratio is 20 to
                                                     1, or 20:1. In general, the exam will be looking for the trailing P/E ratio, which means
                                                     the earnings used are the actual results for the past 12 months. Some analysts use the
                                                     forward P/E ratio; that is, using the projected earnings for the coming 12 months.

                                       Growth companies usually have higher P/E ratios than do cyclical companies. Investors
                                       are willing to pay more per dollar of current earnings if a company’s future earnings are
                                       expected to be dramatically higher than earnings for stocks that rise and fall with business
                                       cycles. Companies subject to cyclical fluctuations generally sell at lower P/E ratios; declining
                                       industries sell at still lower P/E ratios. Investors should beware of extremely high or extremely
                                       low P/E ratios. Speculative stocks often sell at one extreme or the other.

                                       If a stock’s market price and P/E ratio are known, the earnings per share can be calculated as
                                       follows:

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              If the price of the stock is $29 and that is 20 times the earnings, the earnings must be
                                              $29/20 or $1.45 per share.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              A company’s stock trades for $30 per share and has earnings of $1.50 per share. It has
                                              a P/E (multiple) of 20 ($30 ÷ 1.5 = 20). If the average P/E of the company’s industry is 11,
                                              this stock is high-priced. If the average P/E is 35, this company is low-priced.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              Some fundamental analysts feel that the company’s sales to earnings ratio is more
                                              valuable than the P/E ratio because different accounting methods can impact earnings
                                              much more than sales.


                                    Price-to-Book Ratio
                                    The price-to-book ratio reflects the market price of the common stock relative to its book
                                    value per share. It is the current market price divided by the book value per share. As stated
                                    previously, the balance sheet is used to calculate book value. The book value is the theoretical
                                    value of a company (stated in dollars per share) in the event of liquidation and bears no
                                    relationship to the stock’s current trading price. When calculating book value, fixed assets are
                                    shown at their cost less accumulated depreciation. That is, a drill press that had an original
                                    cost of $100,000 but has been depreciated by $40,000 would be counted as $60,000 when
                                    calculating the company’s book value.

                                    This ratio is particularly useful when evaluating companies with inconsistent or negative
                                    earnings.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              A quick rundown of the most testable points about ratios follows.
                                               Book value is the company’s theoretical liquidation value expressed on a per
                                                 share basis.
                                               Growth companies have higher P/E ratios than do cyclical or defensive
                                                 companies.
                                               Earnings per share relates only to common stock; it assumes preferred dividends
                                                 were paid.

                                                   RMBN common stock is currently selling for $60, which gives the stock a P/E ratio of
                                                   20:1. Based on that information, the earnings per share are

                                                   Answer: B. This is simply telling us that the price of $60 is 20 times the earnings. That
                                                   would make the earnings 60/20 or $3.00.

             INTRODUCTION
                                    Portfolio managers use a range of investment styles and strategies. Although each style attempts
                                    to generate superior investment returns and reduce investment risks, no single style is suited
                                    to every investor. Often, an investment adviser’s role is to guide clients toward a mutual fund
                                    or private money manager that is consistent with the client’s objectives and temperament. The
                                    unit will conclude with a look at some of the techniques used by the various styles and strategies
                                    discussed.

          LESSON 21.1: ASSET ALLOCATION
                                        LO 21.a Discriminate between the major asset classes used in an
                                        asset allocation program.


                                        The Theory of Asset Allocation
                                        Asset allocation (more accurately, but rarely stated, asset class allocation) refers to the
                                        spreading of portfolio funds among different asset classes with different risk and return
                                        characteristics, based on the investment policy statement (IPS). Proponents of asset allocation
                                        feel that the mix of assets within a portfolio, rather than individual stock selection or
                                        marketing timing, is the primary factor underlying the variability of returns in portfolio
                                        performance. There are three major types (each with subclasses) of asset classes:
                                         Stock (equities), with subclasses based on market capitalization, value versus growth, and
                                           foreign equity
                                         Bonds (debt), with subclasses based on maturity (intermediate versus long term), and
                                           issuer (Treasury versus corporate versus non-U.S. issuers)
                                         Cash (or cash equivalents), focusing mainly on the standard risk-free investment and
                                           the 91-day (13-week) Treasury bill but also including other short-term money market
                                           instruments

                                        Proper asset allocation takes into consideration the investor’s desire for preservation of capital,
                                        income, capital growth, or a combination of all of these.

                                        In some instances, tangible assets, such as real estate (usually in the form of REITs), precious
                                        metals and other commodities, and certain collectibles (think fine art), are part of the asset
                                        allocation because these types of assets tend to reduce inflation risk. Increasingly, institutional
                                        investors (and some very high-net-worth individuals due to the high cost of entry) are using
                                        such alternative investment asset classes as ETNs, private equity, and venture capital. It is
                                        important to understand that asset allocation is not simply spreading the money around
                                        helter-skelter to different asset classes—there is a process as described in the following
                                        question:

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                         Which of the following best describes the steps of the asset allocation process?
                                                          A. Determine the objectives and constraints, create the IPS, determine the asset
                                                              allocation, allocate capital, monitor and evaluate.
                                                          B. Determine the objectives and constraints, determine the asset allocation,
                                                              allocate the capital, create the IPS, monitor and evaluate.
                                                          C. Determine the objectives and constraints, perform asset allocation, create the
                                                              IPS, monitor and rebalance.
                                                          D. Determine the objectives and constraints, determine capital market
                                                              expectations, create the IPS, perform asset allocation, monitor and evaluate.
                                                         Answer: A. Steps in the asset allocation process are:

                                                         Step 1: Determine the objectives and constraints of the asset owner.

                                                         Step 2: Create the investment policy statement (IPS).

                                    LO 21.b Identify the risk reduction benefits of diversification.

                                    The term diversification has been used many times already in this manual. The term is a
                                    common one in our everyday life, not restricted to investing. As a technique in portfolio
                                    management, portfolio diversification (i.e., committing to an array of separate investments)
                                    reduces unsystematic risk, such as business risk, and enhances returns. The securities in a
                                    diversified portfolio are selected, in part, because they do not tend to move up or down in
                                    relation to each other; when some go down, the loss is offset by those that rise. That is the
                                    concept we covered with the correlation coefficient. This kind of diversification is enhanced by
                                    the addition of foreign securities to a portfolio, because they are usually not highly correlated
                                    with domestic equity.

                                    There are many ways to classify investment and financial products. The investment pyramid
                                    (shown below) for example, categorizes products according to their risk and return potential.
                                    Another way is to group similar products into specific classes. These classes are generally
                                    defined as the following:
                                     Cash and cash equivalents—passbook savings and checking accounts, money market
                                       accounts, money market funds, certificates of deposit, T-bills
                                     Fixed-income investments—corporate bonds, municipal bonds, Treasury bonds, bond
                                       funds, mortgage-backed securities
                                     Equities—preferred and common stocks of all kinds, growth and income appreciation,
                                       stock mutual funds
                                     Hard assets—real estate, collectibles, precious metals, and stones
                                    Each of these asset classes as a whole responds differently to different types of risk; therefore,
                                    diversifying or allocating investment resources among these classes is a proven way to reduce
                                    risk overall, dampen volatility, and improve the performance of one’s portfolio. Fixed-income
                                    products, for example, are a hedge against deflation; equities are a hedge against inflation.
                                    To minimize market risk, one could diversify among all four asset categories (with additional
                                    diversification within the equities category). To minimize interest rate risk, one could diversify
                                    within the fixed-income category by staggering bond maturity dates. To minimize business
                                    risk, one could allocate among the four categories and purchase mutual funds. To reduce
                                    liquidity risk, one would keep a sufficient portion of assets in cash or cash equivalent assets.

                                                      Simply adding more securities to a portfolio does not necessarily reduce portfolio
                                                      volatility. For example, if the beta of a portfolio was 1.1, adding which of the following
                                                      stocks would most likely increase the overall portfolio volatility?
                                                      Stock A, beta 1.5
                                                      Stock B, beta 1.1
                                                      Stock C, beta 1.0
                                                      Stock D, beta 0.7
                                                      The addition of a security with a beta higher (Stock A) than that of the current portfolio
                                                      will increase overall portfolio volatility.

                                        Diversification is not a synonym for asset allocation. For example, an aggressive young
                                        professional may invest almost exclusively in common stock. That would be a single asset
                                        class. But within that asset class of common stock, the portfolio might consist of the shares of
                                        a dozen or more different companies in varied industries.

                                    management styles.

                                    Asset Allocation Styles
                                    The two most common forms of asset allocation are tactical and strategic. You may see the
                                    terms active and passive management referring to these two.


                                    Tactical Asset Allocation
                                    Tactical asset allocation refers to short-term portfolio adjustments that adjust the portfolio
                                    mix between asset classes in consideration of current market conditions and investor
                                    sentiment.

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              If the stock market is expected to do well over the near term, a portfolio manager may
                                              allocate greater portions of a portfolio to stocks. If the market is expected to decline,
                                              the portfolio manager may allocate greater portions of the portfolio entirely to bonds
                                              and cash. This is done in an attempt to create positive alpha for the portfolio.

                                    An active (tactical) portfolio manager, using a particular stock selection approach, typically
                                    buys and sells individual securities. Active management relies on the manager’s stock picking
                                    and market timing ability to outperform market indexes. Market timing is the strategy of
                                    making buy or sell decisions, generally regarding stocks, by attempting to predict future price
                                    movements. Usually, the focus is on timing the overall market rather than a specific security.

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              An active portfolio manager may position the portfolio in stocks within a few market
                                              sectors (such as pharmaceuticals and technology), frequently trading in and out of
                                              the stocks. An active manager may change the sector focus to capitalize on relative
                                              performance of different sectors during different stages of the business cycle. The
                                              goal is to successfully “time the market.” The term used to describe this process is
                                              sector rotating, sometimes called sector (or segment) rotation. Different sectors of the
                                              economy are stronger at different points in the economic cycle. Each industry sector
                                              follows its cycle as dictated by the stage of the economy. Portfolio managers attempt
                                              to buy into the next sector that is about to experience a move up. When an industry
                                              sector reaches the peak of its move as defined by the business cycle, it is time to start
                                              to sell the sector.

                                        Strategic Asset Allocation
                                        Strategic asset allocation refers to the proportion of various types of investments composing
                                        a long-term investment portfolio.

                                        A passive portfolio manager believes that no particular management style will consistently
                                        outperform market averages and therefore constructs a portfolio that mirrors a market index,
                                        such as the S&P 500. In many cases, rather than construct a portfolio, those following this
                                        style will simply recommend index funds and/or ETFs. Passive portfolio management seeks
                                        low-cost means of generating consistent, long-term returns with minimal turnover.

                                        When a portfolio is passively managed, it can happen that one asset class or even a single
                                        security can rise or decline in such a manner as to cause the portfolio to no longer mirror
                                        the targeted index (or portfolio balance). When that happens, the manager will rebalance the
                                        portfolio (we’ll demonstrate how in the next LO).

                                                    EXAMPLE
                                                    A standard asset allocation model suggests subtracting a person’s age from 100 to
                                                    determine the percentage of the portfolio to be invested in stocks. According to this
                                                    method, a 30-year-old would be 70% invested in stocks and 30% in bonds and cash;
                                                    a 70-year-old would be invested 30% invested in stocks with the remainder in bonds
                                                    and cash.


                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    You may be asked about the relative commission expense when comparing active
                                                    and passive management. It should be obvious that the more active the portfolio, the
                                                    greater role commissions will play in determining overall portfolio performance. That
                                                    is one reason why this style is more appropriate than strategic allocation for wrap-fee
                                                    accounts.


                                        Rebalancing
                                        A passive portfolio is rebalanced to bring the asset mix back to the target allocations. If
                                        the stock market should perform better than expected, the client’s proportion of stocks to
                                        bonds would be out of balance. So, on some timely basis (perhaps quarterly, but not less than
                                        annually), stocks would be sold and bonds would be purchased (or funds would be placed in
                                        cash) to bring the proportions back to the desired levels.

                                                    EXAMPLE
                                                    Using the 70% equity/30% debt model described above, the investor’s initial
                                                    investment of $100,000 is split $70,000 into equity securities and $30,000 into debt
                                                    securities. Let’s say the account is to be rebalanced semiannually. Because of a bull
                                                    market in stocks, six months later, the account value is $120,000. Analysis of the
                                                    account indicates that the value of the equities is now $90,000, whereas the bonds
                                                    have remained stable at $30,000. To rebalance—that is, to bring the account back to
                                                    the 70/30 ratio—it will be necessary to sell $6,000 of the equity and invest those funds
                                                    into debt. That will make the account $84,000 equity and $36,000 debt, our desired
                                                    70/30 ratio. The effect of this is that stocks are sold in a rising market and purchased in
                                                    a falling market, following the old adage of “buy low and sell high.”

                                    Now, you try one:

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   A conservative client’s portfolio is designed to have a 60/40 ratio of debt-to-equity
                                                                                                                                                  Unit 21
                                                   securities. The initial investment was $250,000. One year later, the value of the
                                                   portfolio is $260,000 with $90,000 of that represented by the equity portion. If the
                                                   portfolio is rebalanced annually, this would require
                                                    A. selling $14,000 of debt and buying $14,000 of equity.
                                                    B. selling $14,000 of equity and buying $14,000 of debt.
                                                    C. selling $6,000 of debt and buying $4,000 of equity.
                                                    D. buying $10,000 of equity and selling $10,000 of debt.
                                                   Answer: A. A 60/40 ratio will require that debt represent $156,000 (60% of $260,000)
                                                   and equity represent the balance ($104,000). Thus, this portfolio will be rebalanced
                                                   by selling $14,000 of debt and purchasing $14,000 of equity, choice A.


                                    Constant Ratio Plan
                                    An investment plan that attempts to maintain the type of relationship shown in our example
                                    between debt and equity securities (or other asset classes) is sometimes called a constant ratio
                                    plan. Periodically, the account is rebalanced to bring it back to the desired ratio.


                                    Constant Dollar Plan
                                    This is another form of rebalancing. Under this investment plan, the goal is to maintain a
                                    constant dollar amount in stocks, moving money in and out of a money market fund when
                                    necessary. Using the last example, if the investor had a goal of a constant dollar amount of
                                    $70,000 in stock, the other $30,000 would be placed into a money market fund. When the
                                    stock value rose to $90,000, $20,000 would be liquidated and placed into the money market
                                    account. At this point, the account would have the desired $70,000 in stock and now have
                                    $50,000 in money markets. If the stock value should drop to $55,000, the money market
                                    fund would be tapped for $15,000 to get back to the $70,000 constant dollar amount.

                                              KNOWLEDGE CHECK 21.2
                                              1.   Which of the following statements is correct regarding a portfolio manager employing
                                                   a tactical style?
                                                     A. The commission expense will likely be higher than one employing a passive
                                                         style.
                                                    B. The portfolio will be rebalanced more often than would be the case with a
                                                         passive style.
                                                    C. The manager is looking to create a positive beta.
                                                    D. The portfolio will contain a high percentage of index ETFs.
                                              2.   A senior client’s IRA $500,000 portfolio is 30/70 equity/debt mix. Six months later, the
                                                   portfolio balance is $520,000, of which $170,000 is equity. If the investment adviser
                                                   recommends semiannual rebalancing, the client will
                                                     A. sell $14,000 of the equity and use the proceeds to purchase $14,000 of debt.
                                                     B. sell $14,000 of the debt and use the proceeds to purchase $14,000 of equity.
                                                     C. stay put because selling now would realize a capital gain.
                                                    D. sell $20,000 of equity and leave the debt unchanged to return to the original
                                                         30/70 mix at $500,000.

          LESSON 21.3: POPULAR MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AND TECHNIQUES
                                        LO 21.d Evaluate the methods used to determine the value of equity
                                        securities.

                                        The two approaches most commonly used to select investments are fundamental and technical
                                        analysis. Both fundamental and technical analysts attempt to forecast prices or values of
                                        securities and markets.


                                        Fundamental Analysis
                                        Fundamental analysts evaluate broad-based economic trends; current business conditions
                                        within an industry; and the quality of a particular corporation’s business, finances, and
                                        management. Technical analysts attempt to predict the direction of prices on the basis of
                                        charts reflecting price and trading volume patterns of specific securities without regard to the
                                        issuer’s profitability. We will begin our discussion with fundamental analysis.

                                        Fundamental analysis is the study of the business prospects of an individual company within
                                        the context of its industry and the overall economy. They do this by examining the company
                                        in detail, including the financial statements and company management. We could compare
                                        this to an individual receiving a full physical examination that, in addition to all kinds of tests,
                                        would include a detailed family medical history. With a company, the financial statement
                                        analysis is like the blood tests, x-rays, stress test, and so forth, and the evaluation of the
                                        company’s management is like the medical history. One of the ways these analysts attempt to
                                        determine the value of common stock is through the use of dividend models.


                                        Dividend Models
                                        Some analysts believe that the value of a stock can be determined based upon current or
                                        anticipated dividends. The models work best with a company with dividends that are paid
                                        with regularity, so it is more popular with larger, well-established organizations than smaller
                                        companies with irregular dividend distributions. Two models used are the dividend discount
                                        model and the dividend growth model.


                                        Dividend Discount Model
                                        This model states that the fair current market value of a stock should be equal to the present
                                        value of all future dividends. There are several methods to use, such as assuming constant or
                                        variable dividends, but the concept is still the same. We take the investor’s expected future
                                        returns (the dividends), and then discount that amount to compute the present value. It is
                                        not necessary to know the formula for the exam; however, it can be calculated by dividing
                                        the annual dividend by the expected return, sometimes referred to as the required rate of
                                        return. For example, if a stock pays a $1.20 dividend and the required rate of return in the
                                        marketplace is 6%, the stock should be worth $20 (1.20/.06). If it is priced above that, it
                                        might be overvalued; if less, it might be undervalued.

                                        This tool may also be used to value preferred stock. Let’s take a look at the following example:

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              If you have a $100 par, 6% preferred stock and the required rate of return is 8%, what
                                              should the current market price of the stock be? You might encounter a question
                                              similar to this on the exam, and you solve it by dividing the $6 dividend (6% of the

                                                                                                                                                Unit 21
                                              $100 par) by the 8% required rate of return: $6.00/.08 = $75. In other words, if this
                                              preferred stock is selling for $75 per share, the $6 annual dividend will produce an 8%
                                              return on your investment.


                                    Dividend Growth Model
                                    This model assumes that the amount of the annual dividend will grow at a constant rate.
                                    Because projections of future growth can be hazy, this model is best used in conjunction
                                    with other forecasting tools. It is not necessary to know the formula for the exam; however,
                                    it should be obvious that the computed value will be higher when dividends are expected to
                                    grow rather than remain the same.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              If you are asked on the exam, “Which model computes a higher current stock price?,”
                                              it should be common sense that the answer that factors in “growth” is the correct one.
                                              Remember, you will never have to do this computation on the test.

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   Among the popular methods of valuing equity securities is the dividend growth
                                                   model. One could expect to see an analyst using this to value any of these except
                                                    A. common stock.
                                                    B. ADRs representing common stock in a foreign company.
                                                    C. preferred stock.
                                                    D. none of these are exceptions.
                                                   Answer: C. In order to use the dividend growth model, there must be a possibility
                                                   of dividend growth. Because preferred stock dividends are fixed, this tool would not
                                                   make any sense.


                                    Technical Analysis
                                    While fundamental analysis looks at the company, technical analysis looks at the market. A
                                    fundamental analyst attempts to measure the business or financial risk inherent in investing
                                    in a particular security, whereas technical analysis is used by an analyst to measure the market
                                    risk assumed when investing in a particular security. You have to know the goal of technical
                                    analysis and several of the more popular technical systems.

                                    Technical analysis is a method of attempting to predict stock price trends over the near term,
                                    generally four to six weeks. The prediction is based on current stock price trends and the
                                    relationship of the present trend to prior trends. These trends are measured through charts of
                                    price movements; therefore, it would be correct to say that a technician uses charts to attempt
                                    to predict future price movements in an effort to reduce timing risk. In using these charts
                                    of price movements, a technician also uses the trading volume of the stock in an attempt
                                    to validate the trends. That is, increasing volume when a stock’s price is rising is a bullish
                                    sign, and increasing volume when the stock’s price is declining is a bearish sign. Let’s start by
                                    defining some key terms.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    A technical analyst charts a stock’s price and volume over a period of time.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    Remember that the market price of a security (the number that is being charted) is
                                                    based on supply and demand.

                                        Trendlines. In an effort to see where the price of stock may be going, the technician charts
                                        where it has been. She attempts to determine from her chart what the trend has been by
                                        drawing a trendline. A popular saying is, “the trend is your friend.”

                                        Support and resistance. Chartists believe that one can understand more about a stock by
                                        studying its chart. Two of the most important conclusions drawn from a chart are the support
                                        levels and resistance levels. The support level is that price where the stock price “bottoms.”
                                        In other words, once it gets that low, there becomes an imbalance between buyers and
                                        sellers (more investors seek to buy than sell) and the price begins to rise. The opposite is the
                                        resistance level, where the stock’s price reaches a high enough level where there are now more
                                        sellers than buyers and the stock no longer rises in price. Just think of the English definitions
                                        of the terms and they make sense—that is, support is where you stop falling and resistance is
                                        where you can’t go any higher.

                                        Breakout. When the price movement penetrates the support level or the resistance level, it is
                                        known as a breakout. The analyst believes that once a breakout has been confirmed, there will
                                        be rapid price movement in the direction of the break until a new support or resistance level
                                        is established. The technician believes that if a breakout through resistance can be spotted, it
                                        represents a good buying opportunity for those quick enough to take advantage. Conversely,
                                        a breakout through the support level would represent a good opportunity for short sellers able
                                        to move quickly.

                                        Moving averages. To avoid the volatility frequently present in stock price trends, analysts
                                        will use the moving average. A moving average attempts to modify the fluctuations of stock
                                        prices into a smoothed trend; the distortions are reduced to a minimum. For example, to plot
                                        a 13-week moving average on a particular stock, take the Friday closing price for each of the
                                        previous 13 weeks, add them together, and divide by 13. That number will be the average
                                        closing price for the last 13 weeks, and that number is plotted. The next week you would
                                        add the new closing price for that week and delete the closing price for the first week used,
                                        14 weeks ago. This average would be plotted on the same chart as the actual current price
                                        movement of the stock. Changes in the trend of the stock being plotted are identified not by
                                        a change in the direction of the moving average but by the price of the security crossing over
                                        the moving average. If the stock price moved below the moving average, it is usually a signal
                                        of a change from a rising market to a declining market. The reverse is also true.


                                        Technical Market Theories
                                        Technical analysts follow various theories regarding market trends.


                                        Short Interest Theory
                                        Short interest refers to the number of shares that have been sold short. Because short
                                        positions must be repurchased eventually, some analysts believe that short interest reflects
                                        mandatory demand that creates a support level for stock prices. High short interest is a bullish
                                        indicator, and low short interest is a bearish indicator.

                                    Odd-Lot Theory
                                    Typically, small investors engage in odd-lot trading, which is transactions of fewer than 100
                                    shares. Odd-lot theorists believe that small investors invariably buy and sell at the wrong
                                    times. When odd-lot traders buy, odd-lot analysts are bearish. When odd-lot traders sell,
                                                                                                                                                Unit 21
                                    odd-lot analysts are bullish.


                                    Advance/Decline Theory
                                    The number of issues closing up or down on a specific day reflects market breadth. The
                                    number of advances and declines can be a significant indication of the market’s relative
                                    strength. When declines outnumber advances by a large amount, the market is bearish even
                                    if it closed higher. In bull markets, advances substantially outnumber declines. Technical
                                    analysts plot daily advances and declines on a graph to produce an advance/decline line that
                                    gives them an indication of market breadth trends.

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  In the assessment of a company’s stock, a technical analyst takes into consideration
                                                  all of the following except
                                                    A. earnings.
                                                    B. market price.

                                                    D. volume.
                                                  Answer: A. A market technician (technical analyst) deals primarily with timing of
                                                  activity and market trends, while a fundamental analyst centers on a particular
                                                  industry or company within an industry and its earnings (choice A), relative health,
                                                  and market potential.

                                                  small investors are generally wrong, making choice C correct.

                                    There are a number of different styles and techniques used by money managers. For the most

                                        Buy and Hold
                                        A buy-and-hold manager rarely trades in the portfolio. This results in lower transaction
                                        costs and capital gains, which are invariably taxed at the lower long-term rate (Unit 15). A
                                        low expense ratio in a mutual fund often may reflect a buy-and-hold approach. This is the
                                        classic passive strategy used by investors for many years and is probably the easiest of all to
                                        implement and follow.

                                        With this strategy, there is always the question, “When do I sell?” As with most investment
                                        strategies, there are varying opinions. On an individual investor level, one of the most
                                        common reasons for unloading a position is a change in objectives. This is certainly true as
                                        one ages, or if one has a windfall, such as an inheritance. Of course, if there is a personal
                                        financial need, the asset will be sold to provide the necessary funds. Portfolio managers using
                                        this style may sell when the stock’s fundamentals have weakened, such as a sharp decrease in
                                        earnings, or there is a change in the competitive arena (think of what digital cameras did to
                                        Kodak). Another case would be when the company’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has reached
                                        levels well above those for its competitors.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    Maybe you’ve owned a car that was, so to speak, a lemon. That generally means that
                                                    you had high maintenance costs. Well, one point to know about the buy-and-hold
                                                    style is that it is just the opposite—it is low maintenance.


                                        Indexing
                                        Investment portfolios constructed to mirror the components of a particular stock index, such
                                        as the S&P 500, will normally perform in line with the index. Because such portfolios are not
                                        actively managed, the costs of managing the portfolio are relatively low. With less frequent
                                        portfolio turnover, these funds have lower transaction costs and tend to be more tax efficient.
                                        Because most professional money managers are unable to consistently outperform market
                                        indexes, indexed mutual fund portfolios are a popular vehicle for investors. With the advent
                                        of index funds and ETFs, this has become a very popular passive strategy.


                                        Growth vs. Value
                                        One of the longest running arguments in investment analysis is, “Which is more successful,
                                        the growth style or the value style?” The father of value investing was Benjamin Graham, and
                                        his text Security Analysis (co-authored with David Dodd) is still widely read today. The exam
                                        won’t ask you about Graham and Dodd but will want you to know the essential features of
                                        both styles.


                                        Growth Style
                                        Portfolio managers using the growth style of portfolio management focus on stocks of
                                        companies whose earnings are growing faster than most other stocks and are expected to
                                        continue to do so. Because rapid growth in earnings is often priced into the stocks, growth
                                        investment managers are likely to buy stocks that are at the high end of their 52-week price
                                        range. Therefore, in the eyes of some, they might be buying stocks that are overvalued.
                                        Because this adds an element of business risk, it is common for growth managers to include
                                        some negatively correlated assets to their portfolios.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              Growth managers are looking for earnings momentum.


                                    Value
                                    Portfolio managers using the value style of management concentrate on undervalued or                         Unit 21
                                    out-of-favor securities whose price is low relative to the company’s earnings or book value and
                                    whose earnings prospects are believed to be unattractive by investors and securities analysts.
                                    In fact, sometimes value managers think they can find a bargain with companies that are
                                    currently operating at a loss (no earnings, hence no P/E ratio). Value investment managers
                                    seek to buy undervalued securities before the company reports positive earnings surprises.
                                    Their primary source of information is the company’s financial statements. Value investment
                                    managers are more likely to buy stocks that are at the bottom of their 52-week price range.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              In addition to the pricing models expressed above, growth managers expect to see
                                              high P/E ratios (price-to-earnings ratios) or high price-to-book ratios with little or no
                                              dividends. On the other hand, value managers expect to see low P/E ratios or low
                                              price-to-book ratios and dividends offering a reasonable yield. Another sign of a value
                                              stock is a large cash surplus, sometimes referred to as a rainy day fund.

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              ABC Co. is a metal processor for parts used in the automotive industry. Earnings per
                                              share have grown by a compounded rate of 8% per year for the past 15 years but are
                                              somewhat susceptible to downturns in the economy. The stock has paid a quarterly
                                              dividend that has increased five times in the past 10 years, and the current market
                                              price of the stock is 6 times the earnings. Conservatively managed, the company owns
                                              assets and cash that exceed the market value of its common stock. ABC would be
                                              attractive to value investors because its intrinsic value is higher than its market value,
                                              it appears to pay liberal dividends, and it is selling for a low earnings multiple.


                                    Other Portfolio Management Styles
                                    In addition to those already described, there are several other styles you should be familiar
                                    with.


                                    Contrarian
                                    A contrarian is an investment manager who takes positions opposite that of other managers or
                                    in opposition to general market beliefs. In essence, these managers buy when everyone else is
                                    selling and sell when everyone else is buying.


                                    Income vs. Capital Appreciation
                                    At first glance, this might appear to be a rehashing of growth versus value and, although there
                                    are some similarities, you should be aware of what each of these styles represents.

                                    Capital appreciation can take several forms, from moderate to aggressive. Although growth
                                    stocks will frequently be found in these portfolios, the hunt for appreciation will also involve
                                    options and/or futures, special situation stocks (potential takeover or merger candidates),
                                    futures, IPOs, and day trading. When recommending a manager using this style, it is critical




21_0-2532_LEM_65E_Unit21.indd 529                                                                                                          28/10/22 3:19 PM

                                        to determine where on the risk scale, from lower to moderate to speculative, this manager’s
                                        philosophy is. Then, and only then, can you attempt to match it with your clients.

                                        As the term implies, the income style focuses on generating portfolio income. When
                                        dividends on common stock offer better income opportunities than interest on debt
                                        securities, the portfolio will be overweighted in that direction. Frequently, the search for
                                        income will lead the portfolio manager to foreign securities and/or high-yield bonds. When
                                        recommending a manager using this style, it is important to evaluate the risks being taken to
                                        provide income. For the most part, an income style relies heavily on debt securities.


                                        Market Capitalization
                                        Another portfolio management style is using market capitalization to influence security
                                        selection. A company’s market capitalization (usually referred to as market cap) is the product
                                        of the number of outstanding shares and the current market price per share. For example, if
                                        a corporation has 100 million shares of common stock outstanding and the market price per
                                        share is $50, the market cap is $5 billion.

                                        Although the boundaries are imprecise, micro-cap companies are generally those with a
                                        market capitalization of less than $300 million; small-cap companies are generally those with
                                        a market capitalization of between $300 million and $2 billion; mid-cap companies are those
                                        with $2 billion to $10 billion; and large-cap companies are those with more than $10 billion.

                                        It is generally assumed that small companies with a short history, small product line, and
                                        limited financial resources represent a larger degree of risk in an economic downturn. As
                                        revenues, product diversification, and financial worth increase, the relative risk the company
                                        carries in a weak economy diminishes. In Unit 22, we will match each level to its appropriate
                                        benchmark index.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    Look out for numbers written in long form. For example, where would you categorize a
                                                    stock with a market capitalization of $5,000,000,000? Were you able to fight through all
                                                    of those zeroes to see that this is $5 billion and is a mid-cap security?

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    In a strong economy, small, fast-moving companies with a concentrated product
                                                    line in a fast-growing sector can dramatically outperform larger, more bureaucratic
                                                    companies.


                                        Monte Carlo Simulations
                                        Stochastic modeling is a method of financial analysis that attempts to forecast how
                                        investment returns on different asset classes vary over time by using thousands of simulations
                                        to produce probability distributions for various outcomes. The term stochastic comes from the
                                        Greek word meaning “to aim or guess.”

                                        When an investment adviser is called upon to provide advice on developing a plan for a
                                        client’s funds to last throughout what might be a 30-year or even longer retirement, all the
                                        adviser can do is make an educated guess.

                                        A popular form of stochastic modeling that uses computer-generated distributions is the
                                        Monte Carlo simulation (MCS). This simulation is an analytic and risk management tool

                                    widely used in finance. MCS incorporates computer programming to generate thousands of
                                    different probabilities.

                                    Consider the uncertainty in retirement planning. Small changes in the projected rate of return
                                    will make a dramatic difference in the outcome. Life expectancy is also another important
                                    variable that may be incorrectly approximated. MCS uses a random number generator to                         Unit 21
                                    provide an output with specific probabilities of outcomes. The simulation provides insight
                                    into the range of outcomes and provides the user (the investor or adviser) with both best-case
                                    and worst-case scenarios.

                                    Advantages:
                                     MCS can clearly display trade-offs of risk and return. The paths can be ranked from best
                                       to worst to assess the probability of any given outcome.
                                     A clearer understanding of short-term and long-term risk can be gained. For example,
                                       reducing the holdings of risky stock would reduce the short-term variability of the
                                       portfolio but increase the long-term risk of running out of money.
                                     MCS can better model the real probability process where return over time depends not
                                       only on the starting value of the period but also on the additions or withdrawals to the
                                       portfolio at each future period.
                                     Points along the timeline can be considered to answer questions such as the following:
                                       “Do savings need to be increased?” “Can I retire earlier?” “Must I retire later?” “Do I need
                                       to reduce my withdrawal rate?” “Can I increase my withdrawal rate?”

                                    Disadvantages:
                                     Simplistic use of historical data, such as expected returns, for the inputs. Returns change
                                       and have a major effect on projected future values of the portfolio.
                                     Models that simulate the return of asset classes but not the actual assets held. Simulating
                                       the return of the Wilshire 5000 or the S&P 500 when a fund with fees will be held could
                                       significantly overstate the future value or time period over which distributions can be
                                       sustained.

                                    For an individual entering retirement, the timing of the cash flows out of the portfolio and
                                    the sequence of returns are critical.

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              Consider two clients, Mr. Jones and Ms. Smith. Both enter retirement with $1 million,
                                              both withdraw $50,000 per year from their portfolios, and both portfolios generate an
                                              average return of 10% over the life of the portfolios. Their yearly results are the same,
                                              but they come in different sequences. Mr. Jones experiences 15 up years followed by
                                              5 down years. Ms. Smith experiences 5 down years followed by 15 up years. Mr. Jones
                                              will be better off than Ms. Smith, because Ms. Smith will deplete her portfolio in the
                                              early years, and hence her portfolio will not benefit fully from the positive return years
                                              down the line.
                                              The concept of ill-timed cash flows may be easy for experienced advisers to grasp,
                                              but it is not one that clients readily understand. Through the use of MCS, advisers can
                                              easily generate charts and graphs to educate clients about sequential return issues.

                                        LO 21.f Compare the three techniques for minimizing interest rate
                                        risk.

                                        Most of the substance of the exam will deal with strategies employed in equity investing, but
                                        you may be asked about several popular strategies used by bond buyers. Primarily, the goal in
                                        all of these strategies is to mitigate the effects of interest rate fluctuations on the value of the
                                        principal, the income received, or both. Three in particular that have appeared on the exam
                                        are:
                                         the barbell strategy;
                                         the bullet strategy; and
                                         the laddering strategy.
                                        All three of these are considered active rather than passive, and we will look at them
                                        individually.


                                        Barbells
                                        Envision a barbell—what do you see? A thin bar with heavy weights of equal size on each
                                        end. That’s what a bond portfolio using the barbell strategy looks like. The investor purchases
                                        bonds maturing in one or two years and an equal amount maturing in 10 (or more) years with
                                        no bonds in between.

                                        Assuming a normal yield curve, the long-term end of the barbell contains bonds offering
                                        the higher long-term interest rates, while the short-term end provides you with soon-to-be-
                                        realized cash (as they mature) that may be reinvested at higher rates if that is the direction the
                                        market takes. This is not a passive strategy like buy and hold—you will be actively buying new
                                        bonds as the old ones get closer to maturity.


                                        Bullets
                                        For what do you use a bullet? You use it to hit a target, and that is the concept behind the
                                        bullet strategy. Let’s say the target is funds for a child’s college education, and the child
                                        is currently 6 years old. This strategy would have the investor purchase bonds today that
                                        mature in 12 years (assuming college will start when the child is 18). Two years from now,
                                        the investor should purchase some more bonds, but those should have a 10-year maturity. In
                                        another 2 years, another purchase is made, this time of bonds that have 8 years to go,
                                        and so forth. A picture of this active strategy would reveal bonds purchased at different times
                                        but all maturing at the same time. This tends to allow the investor to capture current interest
                                        rates as they change rather than having the entire portfolio locked into one rate.


                                        Ladders
                                        Picture a ladder. You see rungs at set intervals going from bottom to top. That is the concept
                                        behind a laddered portfolio. Unlike the bullet strategy described previously, where the bonds
                                        are bought at different times but all mature together, in a laddered strategy, the bonds are all
                                        purchased at the same time but mature at different times (like the steps on the ladder). As the
                                        shorter maturities come due, they are reinvested and now become the long-term ones. This
                                        has also been a very common strategy with those purchasing CDs at their local bank.

                                                   An investor in debt securities might elect to use any one of the following techniques
                                                   to limit interest rate risk except

                                                   Answer: C. The longer the duration, the greater the interest rate risk, so the investor
                                                   would not want to do that. The others are useful strategies for reducing interest rate
                                                   risk.

                                                   below the book value per share is most likely categorized as

                                                    A. A bond ladder strategy involves the purchase of very long-term and very
                                                        short-term bonds.
                                                    B. A laddered portfolio of bonds will provide lower yields than a portfolio
                                                        consisting entirely of short-term bonds.
                                                    C. A bond ladder strategy is generally more aggressive than a bond barbell
                                                        strategy.
                                                    D. A bond ladder strategy is a relatively easy way to immunize a portfolio against
                                                        interest rate risk.


             LESSON 21.4: MODERN PORTFOLIO THEORY

                                    LO 21.g Identify the components of the capital market theory.


                                    Capital Market Theory
                                    Portfolio management theory builds on a foundation of assumptions about investors’ behavior
                                    and was first introduced by Harry Markowitz in 1952. At its core, modern portfolio theory
                                    proceeds from the premise that investors will behave rationally. Pricing models have been
                                    introduced to determine what should be the proper market price for investment assets. The
                                    most familiar and useful of these models is the capital asset pricing model, known as CAPM,
                                    which derives from the work of Markowitz and others, including William Sharpe, after whom
                                    the Sharpe ratio was named.

                                    There are several capital market theories, all with the goal of maximizing returns while
                                    minimizing risks.

                                        The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is a securities market investment theory allowing
                                        the investor to determine an asset’s expected rate of return, a form of risk-adjusted return
                                        encapsulating how much risk the investor should assume to obtain a particular return from an
                                        investment. The CAPM does so solely on the basis of the asset’s systematic (nondiversifiable)
                                        risk.

                                        It was William Sharpe who first formulated the CAPM in the 1960s. The basic premise is
                                        that every investment carries two distinct risks: systematic risk, which cannot be diversified
                                        away, and unsystematic risk, which can be mitigated through appropriate diversification. As a
                                        result of this work and its further refinements, Professor Sharpe was awarded the Nobel Prize
                                        in Economics in 1990 (that isn’t tested). You will see several applications of the CAPM in
                                        upcoming paragraphs.


                                        Modern Portfolio Theory
                                        Modern portfolio theory (MPT) is an approach that attempts to quantify and control
                                        portfolio risk. It differs from a traditional securities analysis in that it emphasizes determining
                                        the relationship between risk and reward in the total portfolio rather than analyzing specific
                                        securities. Under the CAPM, the investor should be rewarded for the risks taken, so it is
                                        proper to assume that the higher the risk, the higher the return.

                                        Instead of emphasizing particular stocks, MPT focuses on the relationships among all the
                                        investments in a portfolio. This theory holds that specific risk can be diversified away by
                                        building portfolios of assets whose returns are not correlated.

                                        MPT diversification allows investors to reduce the risk in a portfolio while simultaneously
                                        increasing expected returns.

                                        Diversification reduces risk only when assets whose prices move inversely, or at different
                                        times, in relation to each other are combined. In other words, decreased correlation leads to
                                        decreased risk.

                                        The theory is that, all factors being equal, the portfolio with the least amount of volatility
                                        would do better than one with a greater amount of volatility.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    The goal is to design the optimal portfolio. An optimal portfolio is one that returns
                                                    the highest rate of return consistent with the amount of risk an investor is willing to
                                                    take. In other words, an optimal portfolio is the portfolio that makes the best trade-off
                                                    between risk and reward for a given investor’s investment profile. Simply stated, given
                                                    a choice between assets with equal rates of expected return, the risk-averse investor
                                                    will always select the asset with the lowest level of risk.

                                                    PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                         Risk aversion means that if two assets have identical expected returns, a risk-averse
                                                         individual will choose the asset with the
                                                           A. lower risk level.
                                                           B. higher standard deviation.
                                                           C. shorter payback period.
                                                           D. higher expected return.

                                                   Answer: A. Risk-averse investors are those with a low tolerance or capacity for risk.
                                                   Given a choice between assets with equal rates of expected return, the risk-averse
                                                   investor will always select the asset with the lowest level of risk, choice A. Standard
                                                   deviation is a way to quantify risk—the higher the standard deviation, the greater the
                                                   volatility. The payback period is used to evaluate capital projects, not investment
                                                   returns.

                                    Capital Market Assumptions
                                    The capital market theory builds upon the Markowitz portfolio model. The main assumptions
                                    of the capital market theory are as follows.
                                    1. All investors can borrow or lend money at the risk-free rate of return.
                                    2. All investors are rational and evaluate investments in terms of expected return and
                                       variability (standard deviation). Therefore, given a set of security prices and a risk-free
                                       rate, all investors use the same information to generate an efficient frontier.
                                    3. The time horizon is equal for all investors: when choosing investments, investors have
                                       equal time horizons for the chosen investments.
                                    4. There are no transaction costs or personal income taxes; investors are indifferent between
                                       capital gains and dividends.
                                    5. There is no inflation.
                                    6. All assets are infinitely divisible: this indicates that fractional shares can be purchased.
                                    7. There is no mispricing within the capital markets: it is assumed that the markets are
                                       efficient and that no mispricings within the markets exist. Another way to state this is that
                                       capital markets are in equilibrium.


                                    Capital Market Line
                                    One of the offshoots of the CAPM is the capital market line (CML). The CML provides an
                                    expected return based on the total level of risk as measured by the standard deviation. The
                                    equation for the CML uses the:
                                     expected return of the portfolio;
                                     risk-free rate;
                                     return on the market;
                                     standard deviation of the market; and
                                     standard deviation of the portfolio.

                                               TAKE NOTE
                                               Note that the CML, like Markowitz’s efficient frontier, uses standard deviation as the
                                               measure of risk.

                                               TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                               Please note that alpha and beta are not used in the CML equation, while standard
                                               deviation is used.

                                        Efficient Portfolios/Efficient Frontier
                                        The goal of modern portfolio theory is to construct the most efficient portfolio. One selects
                                        the efficient set from the feasible set. The feasible set of portfolios represents all portfolios that
                                        can be constructed from a given set of equities. An efficient portfolio is one that offers:
                                         the most return for a given amount of risk; or
                                         the least risk for a given amount of return.
                                        The collection of efficient portfolios is called the efficient set or efficient frontier. The
                                        universe of these portfolios is, in turn, plotted on a risk-return parabola known as the efficient
                                        frontier. Specifically, this curve represents that set of portfolios that has the maximum rate of
                                        return for every given level of risk. The objective is for the portfolio to lie on the curve. Then,
                                        by being on the efficient frontier, the optimal portfolio has been created. Any portfolio that is
                                        below the curve (not an efficient one) is said to be taking too much risk for too little return.
                                        A portfolio above the efficient frontier is impossible. In pictorial terms, the efficient frontier is
                                        depicted as follows:

                                                                   A                       C

                                        Every portfolio residing on the efficient frontier has either a higher rate of return for equal
                                        risk or lower risk for an equal rate of return than another portfolio below (under­neath) the
                                        frontier. For example, in the previous graphic, Portfolios A and B are both equally efficient
                                        and are more efficient than Portfolio C because:
                                        1. Portfolio A has an equal expected rate of return as Portfolio C but with a significantly
                                           lower level of assumed risk; and
                                        2. Portfolio B has an equal level of assumed risk as Portfolio C but with a significantly higher
                                           expected rate of return.

                                        Therefore, Portfolio C is inefficient; it is attainable but not optimal.

                                        Portfolio D is unattainable because it resides above the efficient frontier. As the graphic
                                        indicates, the expected rate of return is unattainable because it is located outside the universe
                                        of available portfolios.

                                        In the figure, Portfolios A and B are both efficient, but Portfolio C is not.

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   According to modern portfolio theory, the optimal portfolio is one that
                                                    A. lies above the efficient frontier.
                                                    B. lies below the efficient frontier.

                                                                                                                                                   Unit 21
                                                    C. lies on the efficient frontier.
                                                    D. provides the lowest return for the highest risk.
                                                   Answer: C. The efficient frontier is a curve representing the amount of return for a
                                                   specified risk. Portfolios residing on that curve provide the highest return for that
                                                   level of risk and are considered optimal or efficient portfolios. A portfolio below the
                                                   efficient frontier is inefficient, and a portfolio cannot lie above the curve.


                                    LO 21.h Calculate the expected return using the security market line.

                                    The CML provides an expected return for a portfolio based on the expected return of the
                                    market, the risk-free rate of return, and the standard deviation of the portfolio in relation
                                    to the standard deviation of the market. The CML is generally used to evaluate diversified
                                    portfolios. The security market line (SML), which is derived from the CML, allows us to
                                    evaluate individual securities for use in a diversified portfolio based on:
                                     The expected return for the asset
                                     The risk-free rate
                                     The return on the market
                                     The beta of the asset
                                    The security market line determines the expected return for a security on the basis of its beta
                                    and the expectations about the market and the risk-free rate. Basically, we want to determine
                                    how much over the risk-free rate we should earn for taking the investment risk. You may be
                                    asked to compute the expected return using the SML. It is done like this:

                                    We start by comparing the market’s return to the RF rate (expecting it will be higher because
                                    of the risk). Then we multiply that difference by the stock’s beta and add that number to the
                                    RF rate. Here is the formula:

                                    ([Return of the market - the risk-free rate] × beta) + RF rate

                                    It is much easier to follow with the numbers.

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              If the beta of ABC Company is 1.2 and the market return is expected to be 13% with a
                                              risk-free return of 3%, then the expected return of ABC is 15%, as follows:
                                              Let’s follow the formula we just showed you. We begin with the difference between
                                              the risk-free rate and market rate (13% − 3) = 10%. Then we multiply the expected
                                              return in excess of the RF rate by the stock’s beta, (10% × 1.2) = 12%. Finally, we add
                                              the RF rate (3%) to the 12% and arrive at 15%. Therefore, on the basis of the level of
                                              systematic risk of ABC Company, it should earn a return of 15%. The SML helps identify
                                              how the characteristics of a portfolio will be impacted when a security is added to the
                                              portfolio. You should note that the SML accounts for the impact of systematic risk (as
                                              measured by beta) only and does not take into consideration unsystematic risk, which
                                              is assumed to have been diversified away.

                                                    The CML measures the risk through standard deviation (total risk). The SML measures
                                                    the risk through beta (systematic risk only).


                                        LO 21.i Identify the three forms of the efficient market hypothesis.

                                        The efficient market hypothesis (EMH) maintains that security prices adjust rapidly to new
                                        information, with security prices fully reflecting all available information. In other words,
                                        markets are efficiently priced as a result. This is sometimes referred to as the random walk
                                        theory. The random walk theory would suggest that “throwing darts” at the stock listings is as
                                        good a method as any for selecting stocks for investment.

                                        Eugene F. Fama, professor at the University of Chicago, coined the term in a 1965 Financial
                                        Analysts Journal article entitled “Random Walks in Stock Market Prices.”

                                        There are three versions of the EMH based upon the level of available information. The more
                                        information available, the more likely it is that you should be able to beat the market. But,
                                        as we will see, under this theory the conclusion is that under all circumstances, there is no
                                        way to accurately predict stock prices, and a passive strategy is probably the most suitable for
                                        investment success.


                                        Weak Form Market Efficiency
                                        The weak form holds that current stock prices have already incorporated all historical market
                                        data and that historical price trends are, therefore, of no value in predicting future price
                                        changes. Although fundamental analysis and insider information may produce above-market
                                        returns under the weak form, technical analysis is of no value. Indeed, none of the forms of
                                        EMH attributes any value to technical analysis.


                                        Semi-Strong Form Market Efficiency
                                        The semi-strong form holds that current stock prices not only reflect all historical price data but
                                        also reflect data from analyzing financial statements, industry, or current economic outlook.
                                        Thus, even fundamental analysis is of no value in this form, and only insider information may
                                        produce above-market returns. Technical analysis is also of no value.


                                        Strong Form Market Efficiency
                                        The strong form of the EMH states that security prices fully reflect all information from both
                                        public and private sources. The strong form includes all types of information: past security
                                        market, public, and private (inside) information. This means that no group of investors has
                                        monopolistic access to information relevant to the formation of prices, and none should be
                                        able to consistently achieve positive abnormal returns.

                                        Although some would disagree, the prevailing opinion is that the only thing that will work in
                                        this case is the random walk—just throwing darts, because the market is totally efficient, with
                                        market prices quickly adjusting to reflect new information.

                                             TAKE NOTE
                                             According to the EMH, if a financial market is weakly efficient, technical analysis will
                                             be useless, but it is still possible to use fundamental analysis to seek out mispriced
                                             investments. On the other hand, if a financial market is semi-strongly efficient, there

                                                                                                                                                   Unit 21
                                             is no point in using any fundamental analysis tools—all of that information is already
                                             in the hands of all investors. If a financial market is strongly efficient, then everything,
                                             including information generally only available to insiders, is known and, without an
                                             edge, there is no benefit to be gained by using any analytical tools.

                                             TAKE NOTE
                                             As a base level knowledge of the EMH, you should know that the weak form is based
                                             on past security market information; the semi-strong form is based on all public
                                             information (including market information); and the strong form is based on both
                                             public information and inside or private information.

                                             You may have to know that there is no such term as semi-weak EMH. We can’t
                                             imagine what would be weaker than weak anyway.

                                             PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                  Followers of the efficient market hypothesis believe that
                                                   A. following the business cycle is the best way to maximize returns.
                                                   B. concentration, rather than diversification, will produce superior returns.
                                                   C. by following the pundits on TV, you’ll wind up rich.
                                                   D. an efficient market is one that produces random results.
                                                  Answer: D. EMH is really just an extension of the random walk theory, which states
                                                  that “throwing darts” at the stock market page is as good as any way to select
                                                  investments. If the market is truly efficient, no one has an edge.

                                             1.   The capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is a securities market investment theory
                                                  allowing the investor to determine an asset’s expected rate of return, a form of
                                                  risk-adjusted return encapsulating how much risk the investor should assume to
                                                  obtain a particular return from an investment. The theory includes a number of
                                                  assumptions. Which of the following is not one of those assumptions?
                                                    A. All investors can borrow or lend money at the risk-free rate of return.
                                                    B. The time horizon is equal for all investors.
                                                    C. There are no transaction costs or personal income taxes other than those on
                                                        capital gains.
                                                    D. There is no inflation.

          LESSON 21.5: AVERAGING AND HEDGING TECHNIQUES

                                        LO 21.j Illustrate how dollar cost averaging results in lowering an
                                        investor’s average cost per share.

                                        One common fear of investors is buying at the top of the market. One can never know when
                                        a bull market will reverse its course. Conversely, we all want to get in at the bottom, but how
                                        do you know when the bear market is over? Because no one knows all of the answers, one
                                        popular technique is time-based investing to average your cost. The most tested time-based
                                        investment program used by investors is dollar cost averaging.

                                        Investors use dollar cost averaging as a means to invest consistent amounts of money in a
                                        mutual fund or stock at regular periodic intervals, such as monthly or quarterly. This form of
                                        investing allows the individual to purchase more shares when prices are low and fewer shares
                                        when prices are high. This has the effect of reducing timing risk, the risk that all of your
                                        money will be invested at a market top. In a fluctuating market, the average cost per share is
                                        lower than the average price per share.

                                                    EXAMPLE
                                                    The following table illustrates how average price and average cost may vary with dollar
                                                    cost averaging.

                                                     Total              $2,400             $114               90

                                                    The average cost per share equals $2,400 (the total investment) divided by 90 (the total
                                                    number of shares purchased), or $26.67 per share, whereas the average price per share
                                                    is $28.50 ($114 ÷ 4). With any market fluctuations, this strategy will produce a lower
                                                    cost ($26.67) than average price ($28.50). This average cost of $26.67, not the average
                                                    price paid of $28.50, is the investor’s cost basis when the shares are subsequently sold.

                                              Although it is unlikely that you will have to compute the average price or average cost
                                              per share, a question may ask the purpose of dollar cost averaging. The purpose of
                                              dollar cost averaging is to reduce the investor’s average cost to acquire a security over

                                    LO 21.k Describe the use of put and call options to hedge positions.


                                    Hedging Strategies
                                    The final strategy discussed in this unit is using options to hedge a position. In the real world,
                                    these are very popular tools to limit risk, and the exam usually contains one question on their
                                    use. An investor with a long position in a stock (she owns it) can use options to hedge the
                                    position’s risks. Remember the term hedge, used in this context, means to protect.


                                    Long Stock and Long Puts
                                    What if the investor is concerned about a potential drop in the price of her stock? An investor
                                    who owns a stock can protect against a decline in market value by buying a put. Doing so
                                    allows the investor to sell the stock by exercising the put if the stock price declines before
                                    expiration, which will offset the decline in the stock price. This strategy is called portfolio
                                    insurance or the purchase of a protective put. Any profits in the stock are offset by the cost
                                    of the put premiums.

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              A concerned (afraid) investor who owns 100 shares of stock with a current market
                                              value of $50 purchases a 50 put at $2.50 for protection. If the stock goes down to $40
                                              per share, the investor has the ability to exercise the put, deliver the stock, and receive
                                              $50 per share. The only cost for this protection is the premium of $2.50 paid for the
                                              put. So, instead of losing $1,000, the loss was held to only $250.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              This strategy is also useful for managers of large portfolios, such as pension funds.
                                              If the portfolio consisted of large-cap stocks, a way to hedge against a down market
                                              would be to purchase put options on an index that mirrors the portfolio. In the case
                                              of large-cap stocks, that would generally be the S&P 500 index (more about that in
                                              Unit 22).


                                    Long Stock and Short Calls (Covered Call Writing)
                                    A covered call is a call written (sold) on a stock an investor owns. The covered call writer
                                    reduces the risk of that long stock position and generates income with the dollars received in
                                    premiums from selling the call. If the call is not exercised, the call writer keeps the premium.
                                    If the call is exercised, the covered call writer can deliver the stock owned. The covered call
                                    writer limits potential gain in exchange for the partial protection against a loss.

                                    Partial protection. By writing a covered call and receiving the premium, an investor, in effect,
                                    reduces the stock cost by the premium amount. If the stock price falls below the purchase
                                    price minus the premium received, the investor incurs a loss. Should the stock price rise
                                    dramatically, the stock will likely be called.

                                                    EXAMPLE
                                                    An investor buys 100 shares of RST at 53 and writes 1 RST 55 call for 2. The premium
                                                    offsets the stock price by the $2 per share premium received. The maximum gain
                                                    equals $400: if the stock price rises above 55, the call will be exercised; thus, the
                                                    investor will sell the stock for a gain of $200, in addition to the $200 premium received.
                                                    The $200 premium initially received lowers the true cost of the stock to $51 per share,
                                                    so the investor is protected against loss for the first 2 points of market decline. The
                                                    maximum loss is $5,100 (instead of $5,300) should the stock become worthless.

                                                    TAKE NOTE
                                                    A covered call provides partial protection that generates income but reduces the
                                                    stock’s potential gain. Buying puts provides nearly total loss protection that costs
                                                    money yet does not reduce the stock position’s potential gain. The benefit of the
                                                    covered call is that it does offer some hedging with no cost. In fact, the investor
                                                    actually receives income in the form of the premium.


                                        Short Stock and Long Calls
                                        An investor who sells a stock short sells borrowed stock, expecting the price to decline. The
                                        short seller must buy stock to repay the stock loan and hopes to do so at a lower price. A short
                                        seller can buy calls to protect against a price rise. If you are not familiar with the concept of
                                        short selling, it will be covered in Unit 23.

                                                    EXAMPLE
                                                    An investor sells short 100 shares of RST at 58 and buys an RST 60 call for 3. The
                                                    maximum loss is no longer unlimited as it would normally be for a short sale. Instead,
                                                    it is $500: no matter how high the stock price rises above $60, the investor will exercise
                                                    the call to buy the stock for 60, incurring a $200 loss on the short sale, in addition to
                                                    the $300 paid for the call.

                                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                    The majority of our students report a question on protecting against loss on a short
                                                    sale. As shown above, the best way to hedge is to buy a call option on the stock
                                                    underlying the short sale. This strategy offers full protection against loss. Please notice
                                                    that in protecting the long or short position, the investor buys an option. It is useful
                                                    to remember that “you buy protection; you don’t sell it.” The same logic is true with
                                                    futures contracts. The way to hedge is to buy. That creates what is called a long hedge.

             LEARNING OBJECTIVES
                                    When you have completed this unit, you will be able to accomplish the following.
                                    ❯❯ LO 22.a   Calculate the investment return measurements most commonly found on the exam.
                                    ❯❯ LO 22.b   Match the appropriate benchmarks for various portfolios.
                                    Your exam will include approximately four questions from the topics covered in Unit 22.


             INTRODUCTION
                                    Ultimately, the judge of the value of an investment adviser is the performance of the client’s
                                    account. There are a number of different ways to measure the performance, and one must always
                                    keep in mind that it is how well the account meets the investor’s objectives that counts. For
                                    example, an account that appreciated 10% in one year while distributing an income return of
                                    1% is not meeting the goals of a client needing current income.


             LESSON 22.1: INVESTMENT RETURN MEASUREMENTS
                                    LO 22.a Calculate the investment return measurements most
                                    commonly found on the exam.

                                    There will probably be two computations on your exam dealing with different types of
                                    returns. We’ll cover all of them and indicate which are the most (and least) likely to appear
                                    on your test.

                                       less any capital depreciation) over a given time period, usually one year. As such, total return
                                       is considered to be the best measure of how a security has performed for an investor.

                                                  EXAMPLE
                                                  A common stock purchased for $20 with an annual dividend of $1 is sold after one
                                                  year for $24. The total return on the investment is $5: $1 in dividends plus $4 in capital
                                                  appreciation. The total return, then, is 25% ($5 ÷ $20 = 25%).

                                                  TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                  The exam may require you to know how to calculate total return. Keep in mind that
                                                  the total annual return on an investment includes income and capital appreciation. In
                                                  the case of bonds held to maturity, this is the YTM. Otherwise, it is the coupon income
                                                  plus any appreciation or less any price depreciation. In the case of stocks, one would
                                                  use the dividend income plus or minus the appreciation or depreciation.


                                       Mutual Fund Returns
                                       Unlike other securities, an investor’s total return from a mutual fund investment may include,
                                       in addition to income distributions in the form of dividends, distribution of realized capital
                                       gains. They are all added together, along with unrealized appreciation (or mutual funds must
                                       separate their total return from their current return). The SEC requires that current return
                                       calculations be based only on income distributions for the past 12 months divided by the
                                       current per-share price: annual dividend ÷ current price = current yield.

                                                  PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                       The KAPCO Income Fund has a current public offering price of $10.50 and a net
                                                       asset value per share of $10.00. During the past 12 months, the fund has made four
                                                       quarterly distributions from net investment income of $.15 and one distribution from
                                                       capital gains in the amount of $.25. What would the fund’s current yield be?
                                                        A. 1.5%
                                                        B. 5.7%
                                                        C. 6.0%
                                                        D. 1.1%
                                                       Answer: B. It is computed by dividing the annual income (4 × $.15 = $.60) by the POP
                                                       (not the NAV) of $10.50. Only the dividends are used for current yield.

                                    Holding Period Return
                                    The length of time an investor owns an investment is called the holding period. The return
                                    for that period is called the holding period return (HPR). HPR is the total return, income
                                    plus capital appreciation, of an investment over a specified period, the holding period. It is
                                    essentially the same as the total return, but, whereas the total return is usually computed on
                                    an annual basis, the holding period return can be for any period.

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              An investment purchased for $100 and sold three years later for $120 ($20 capital
                                              appreciation) after paying a total of $30 ($10 per year) in dividends has a holding
                                              period return of 50% ($120 + $30 = $150). The total gain is $150 − $100 = $50. A $50
                                              return on a $100 investment is 50% ($50 ÷ $100 = 50%).

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              Holding period return is not an annualized return. It is the percentage return over a            Unit 22
                                              defined period.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              We tend to focus on looking at the total return and the holding period return
                                              for equities, but it is also a valid measurement for bond returns. In this case, we
                                              combine the interest received and any appreciation or depreciation. However, there
                                              is one other factor that is sometimes considered: the rate at which the coupons are
                                              reinvested. If we assume the bondholder will keep the bond until maturity date, in a
                                              period of rising interest rates, the bondholder should be able to reinvest the coupons
                                              at a higher rate than the current coupon, thus causing the holding period return
                                              to exceed the yield to maturity. If, on the other hand, interest rates are falling, the
                                              coupons will only be able to be reinvested at a lower rate, causing a holding period
                                              return that is less than the bond’s YTM.


                                    Annualized Return
                                    Annualized return is the return an investor would have received had he held an investment
                                    for one year. Annualized return is determined by multiplying the actual return by an
                                    annualization factor. The annualization factor is the number of months in the year divided
                                    by the number of months an investment is held.

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              An investor receives $5 on a $100 investment held for 6 months. The annualized
                                              return is determined by multiplying the 5% return by the annualization factor of 2
                                              (12 months ÷ 6 months = 2) for an annualized return of 10%. Another investor has a
                                              capital gain of 30% from an investment held for 18 months. The annualized return is
                                              20%, calculated as follows: 30 × (12 ÷ 18) = 20.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              The formula we’ve shown you is only approximate (the computation has never been
                                              asked on the exam). In reality, because of compounding, the annualized return would
                                              actually be a bit different. In the first example shown, it would be about 10.2% instead
                                              of 10%. In the second example (the 18-month holding period), it would be about
                                              19.1% instead of 20%.

                                       Inflation-Adjusted Return (Real Return)
                                       Because inflation reduces the buying power of a dollar, investment performance measurements
                                       are often adjusted to provide a measure of the buying power earned from a given investment.
                                       Returns that have been adjusted for inflation are called real rates of return. This is a
                                       frequently required computation on the exam.

                                       To determine the inflation-adjusted rate of return of a debt security, reduce its nominal return
                                       by the inflation rate as reflected in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

                                       To determine the inflation-adjusted rate of return of an equity security, reduce the total
                                       return (as taught above) by the inflation rate as reflected in the CPI.

                                                  EXAMPLE
                                                  A bond with an 8% coupon has a nominal return of 8%. If inflation (as measured by
                                                  the CPI) is 3%, then the inflation-adjusted return of the bond investment is 8% − 3%,
                                                  or 5%.

                                                  EXAMPLE
                                                  Let’s revisit the total return example from a couple of pages ago:
                                                  A common stock purchased for $20 with an annual dividend of $1 is sold after one
                                                  year for $24. The total return on the investment is $5: $1 in dividends plus $4 in capital
                                                  appreciation. The total return, then, is 25% ($5 ÷ $20 = 25%). If the question asked for
                                                  the “real rate of return” and told you that the CPI increase for the period was 6%, you
                                                  would subtract that from the 25% total return to arrive at an inflation-adjusted return
                                                  of 19%.

                                                  EXAMPLE
                                                  For fixed-income investors, inflation and taxes reduce the buying power of their
                                                  dollars. For an investor in the 25% tax bracket in a 2.5% inflationary environment,
                                                  an investment that yields 10% before taxes provides the investor with a 5% after-tax
                                                  inflation-adjusted return. To calculate the 5% after-tax inflation-adjusted return, first
                                                  determine the after-tax return. In this case, 10% less 25% for taxes results in a 7.5%
                                                  after-tax return.
                                                  The easiest way to compute the real rate of return is to reduce the return by the
                                                  amount of inflation during the period. In this case, 7.5% less 2.5% inflation results in
                                                  a 5% after-tax inflation-adjusted return. Even though a calculation of this type might
                                                  not be on your exam, you need to understand the concept that your final returns are
                                                  reduced by both taxes and inflation.

                                                  TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                  The exam will require you to know how to calculate the approximate
                                                  inflation-adjusted return by merely subtracting the CPI from the total return. What
                                                  we’ve shown you is only an approximation—the correct formula is “the sum of one
                                                  plus the nominal rate divided by the sum of one plus the inflation rate, which then is
                                                  subtracted by one,” but we’ve never heard of that being asked on the exam.

                                    Calculating the Return on a TIPS Bond
                                    We covered the basics of TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) in Unit 2. You
                                    might have to compute the value of a TIPS bond after several years, or the amount of an
                                    interest payment. There are two key points to remember:

                                    Every six months, the principal value is adjusted by the change to the cost of living as
                                    measured by the CPI.

                                    Every six months, the semiannual interest payment is calculated by multiplying one-half of
                                    the annual coupon times the adjusted principal. We’ll show you the steps in an example (and
                                    then show you a short cut that will always work on the exam).

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              If you have a TIPS bond with a 3% coupon and the annual inflation rate is 4% for the

                                                                                                                                                 Unit 22
                                              next two years, here is what happens:
                                              Each six months, you will receive 1.5% (half of the annual 3% coupon) of the principal
                                              value as adjusted for the inflation rate. If the inflation rate is 4% per year, that is 2%
                                              each six months. So, after the first semiannual period, the principal value of the bond
                                              is now $1,020 ($1,000 + 2% of $1,000, or 102% × $1,000). Therefore, the first interest
                                              check will be 1.5% × $1,020, or $15.30. Six months later, the adjusted principal value is
                                              $1,040.40 (102% × $1,020), so that interest check will be for $15.61 ($1,040.40 × 1.5%).
                                              As we continue into the next year, the principal will increase to $1,061.21 ($1,040.40
                                              × 102%) and the interest check will be for $15.92. Because we’re only looking at two
                                              years, the ending principal value will be $1,082.43 with the final interest check of
                                              $16.24. As you can see, both the income from the TIPS and its principal value are
                                              increasing at a compounded rate based upon inflation.
                                              We know that some of you may be mathematically challenged, so here is a shortcut
                                              that will always work. The key to the increased principal value of the TIPS is that the
                                              interest is compounding. But you don’t have to do that. In this example, the inflation
                                              rate is 4%. Using just simple interest would mean that the principal would increase
                                              by $40 (4% of $1,000) per year. After two years, that would be $80 or a new principal
                                              amount of $1,080. However, we know that compounding will give us slightly more, so
                                              we choose the first number given in the answers that is above $1,080. The same “trick”
                                              can be used to determine the final interest payment. We take 1.5% of $1,080 ($16.20)
                                              and look for an answer choice that is slightly higher.

                                              Because of the built-in inflation adjustment, the real rate of return on a TIPS bond is
                                              always equal to the coupon rate.


                                    After-Tax Return/Yield
                                    Capital gains and income are generally taxable; thus, taxes reduce the return of an investment.
                                    The after-tax return, also known as the adjusted return, is determined by reducing the
                                    investment’s return by the client’s tax rate.

                                                  EXAMPLE
                                                  The after-tax return of an investment that yields 10% for an investor in the 25% tax
                                                  bracket is calculated by multiplying the return by (1 − .25), or .75. The investor retains
                                                  75% of the 10% yield for a 7.5% after-tax return. Likewise, an investment that returns
                                                  45% over three years provides an after-tax return of 33.75% (.75 × 45%).

                                       The importance of the after-tax return is realizing that any investor’s return is going to be
                                       reduced by the effects of taxation, whether it is the favorable capital gains tax or the higher
                                       ordinary income rate. That is the beauty of programs such as the Roth IRA or Section 529
                                       plan, where it is possible to have totally tax-free returns. Remember, even though the interest
                                       on a municipal bond may be tax free, any capital gains are not.


                                       Probable Return
                                       Unlike historical or actual rates of return, probable returns are estimates of the likely
                                       returns an investment may yield. To determine the probable return of an investment, the
                                       adviser assigns a probability to each return that the investment is likely to earn and then
                                       multiplies that return by the probability of it occurring. The sum of those probable returns
                                       is the expected return for that investment. The formula is as follows: expected or probable
                                       return = (probability of return #1 × possible return #1) + (probability of return #2 × possible
                                       return #2).

                                                  EXAMPLE
                                                  The probable (expected) return of an investment with a 30% probability of returning
                                                  15% and a 70% chance of returning 10% has a total expected return of 11.5%,
                                                  calculated as follows: (.30 × 15% = 4.5%) + (.70 × 10% = 7.0%), or 4.5% + 7.0% = 11.5%.

                                       In effect, this return reflects the arithmetic (mean) return of the portfolio. When one
                                       constructs a portfolio, there are usually securities with different grades of risk and, hence,
                                       different expectations of reward. Investors view the portfolio as a whole, looking to maximize
                                       returns for each level of risk. This overall view, or mean, of the entire portfolio is the expected
                                       or probable return of the portfolio.

                                                  Don’t be surprised to get a question similar to our example above, but with one of
                                                  the possibilities being a negative. Suppose our example had said there was a 30%
                                                  probability of returning 15%, a 40% chance of returning 10%, and a 30% chance of
                                                  losing 8%. The expected return would be (.30 × 15% = 4.5%) + (.40 × 10% = 4.0%) +
                                                  (.30 × –8% = –2.4%) for a total of 6.1% expected return.


                                       Risk-Adjusted Return (Sharpe Ratio)
                                       Securities practitioners have developed many measures to quantify the risk characteristics of
                                       a portfolio. One such measure that may show up on the exam is called the Sharpe ratio. The
                                       ratio is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate (e.g., the 91-day Treasury bill rate) from
                                       the overall return of the portfolio. This result, which is the portfolio’s risk premium, is then
                                       divided by the standard deviation of the portfolio. This ratio measures the amount of return
                                       per unit of risk taken. The higher the ratio, the better or more return per unit of risk taken.

                                              The Sharpe ratio measures risk-adjusted return. The exam might state this as, “The
                                              Sharpe ratio looks at the return compared to the risk.” A high ratio means that the
                                              investor is getting “more bang for the buck.” That is, based on the risk taken, the return
                                              is higher than what would be expected.

                                              You must know that the three components of the Sharpe ratio are:
                                               the actual return, minus
                                               the risk-free rate (the 91-day T-bill rate), divided by
                                               the standard deviation.
                                              Beta is not a part of this ratio.

                                                   91-day T-bill rate: 1.5%

                                                   Answer: B. Any question asking about risk-adjusted return is going to be referring to
                                                   the Sharpe ratio. This is shown as a simple number and is calculated by subtracting
                                                   the risk-free rate (91-day T-bill) from the actual return and dividing that remainder by
                                                   the standard deviation. In this example, 13.5% − 1.5% = 12% divided by 4 = 3%. As
                                                   will often be the case on the exam, there is unnecessary information supplied in the
                                                   question (beta and CPI).


                                    Risk Premium
                                    It should be clear that in order to have a positive Sharpe ratio, our actual return on an
                                    investment must exceed the risk-free return. Therefore, any investor would surely expect to
                                    achieve that higher return, or the investment would not be made. This return is known as the
                                    risk premium.

                                    The required rate of return on any investment is a combination of the risk-free rate plus a risk
                                    premium. For equity investments, the risk premium can be determined by using the capital
                                    asset pricing model (CAPM) discussed in Unit 21.


                                    Internal Rate of Return (IRR)
                                    IRR has been discussed previously, in Unit 20. We’re just going to list a few of the points that
                                    are important for the exam:
                                     IRR is the preferred method of measuring the return on a DPP;

                                        IRR takes into consideration the time value of money; and
                                        IRR is the way the yield to maturity of a bond is computed.


                                       Time-Weighted Returns
                                       Although time-weighted returns and dollar-weighted returns are both methods of
                                       determining a rate of return, they have very different purposes. A time-weighted return is
                                       determined without regard to any subsequent cash flows of the investor. As such, it measures
                                       the performance of the investment over a period of time (and not of the investor, as in a
                                       dollar-weighted approach). Most returns reported on mutual funds are time-weighted because
                                       the portfolio manager does not have any control over the future cash flows to the fund with
                                       respect to investor dollars.


                                       Dollar-Weighted Returns
                                       In contrast, a dollar-weighted return considers subsequent contributions to and withdrawals
                                       from an investment, including sales of, for example, stock. As a result, the dollar-weighted
                                       approach focuses on the return of the investor (not the investment, as in the time-weighted
                                       approach) over a period of time, and usually results in a rate of return different than the
                                       time-weighted method.

                                              The dollar-weighted return reflects the internal rate of return (IRR); the time-weighted
                                              return does not.

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   If you wanted to evaluate the performance of a portfolio manager, you would
                                                   calculate the portfolio’s

                                                     D. time-weighted return.
                                                   Answer: D. Because portfolio managers have no control over the deposits and
                                                   withdrawals made by clients, the time-weighted return (choice D) is a more
                                                   appropriate measure of performance.

                                                   is most likely the adviser would calculate

                                                   share in early May. During the year, XYZ paid $0.50 quarterly dividends on a January,
                                                   April cycle. If the market price of the XYZ stock on December 31 is $54 per share, this
                                                   investor’s total return is

             LESSON 22.2: PORTFOLIO BENCHMARKS

                                    LO 22.b Match the appropriate benchmarks for various portfolios.

                                    Tens of thousands of stocks trade in the stock markets. Stock indexes, such as the S&P 500
                                    or the Utility Index, are smaller groups of stocks that serve as a benchmark for measuring the
                                    performance of the overall market or sectors of the market.

                                    Indexes are generally weighted for the capitalization (number of outstanding shares times the
                                    market price per share) of the companies included. Therefore, a large company’s stock price
                                    changes will have a greater effect on the index. Indexes are often used as benchmark portfolios
                                    against which managed portfolios are measured in order to gauge the performance, or added
                                    value, of the fund manager. In addition, index mutual funds and ETFs will invest in the
                                    securities that compose an index to specifically mirror the index’s performance. Following is a
                                    listing of indexes or averages that may appear on the exam.

                                       Dow Jones Industrial Average
                                       The best known of all of the market indexes are those published by Dow Jones & Company.
                                       There are probably two reasons why the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) is so well
                                       known: first, because the 30 industrial stocks are among the 30 best-known corporations
                                       in the world; and second (and some would say more important), because Dow Jones &
                                       Company also publishes The Wall Street Journal, the nation’s leading financial newspaper.
                                       Because it is price weighted, the Dow Jones is truly an average. Originally it was computed
                                       by adding together the prices of one share for each of the 30 different companies and then
                                       dividing by 30. That had to be changed as soon as the first one of those 30 companies had a
                                       2:1 stock split. Because a stock split will cause the market price of the stock to drop—that is,
                                       the average would be distorted by continuing to divide the 30 current market prices by 30—
                                       an adjustment had to be made to the 30 (called the divisor). Over the years, stock splits and
                                       other distributions have caused that original divisor of 30 to be adjusted. There are three other
                                       Dow Jones Averages: the 20 transportation companies, the 15 utilities, and the composite of
                                       all 65. On November 1, 1999, history was made when non-NYSE stocks were included in the
                                       DJIA for the first time. Added to the average were Microsoft and Intel, which are both listed
                                       on Nasdaq.


                                       Standard & Poor’s 500
                                       The composition of the Standard & Poor’s 500 (S&P 500) Composite Index includes four
                                       main groups of securities: 400 industrials, 20 transportation companies, 40 public utilities,
                                       and 40 financial institutions. The S&P 500 is a cap-weighted index using a base period of
                                       1941–1943 equal to 10. Although most of the stocks in the S&P 500 are listed on the NYSE,
                                       many of the highest-priced issues—Alphabet (Google), Amazon, and Booking Holdings
                                       (Priceline)—are traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market.


                                       New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Index
                                       The NYSE publishes a composite index that covers all of the common stocks listed on the
                                       NYSE, more than 3,000 different companies. This index provides the most comprehensive
                                       measure of market activity on the NYSE. The NYSE index is cap weighted, similar to the
                                       S&P 500, but the base is December 31, 1965, and the index for the base is 50.


                                       Nasdaq Composite Index
                                       The over-the-counter market is represented by the Nasdaq Composite Index, which covers
                                       more than 3,000 over-the-counter companies. The Nasdaq Composite Index is calculated in a
                                       manner similar to those used for the S&P and NYSE indexes, with a base period of February
                                       5, 1971, and an index number of 100. These indexes, their subgroups, and several other
                                       popular indexes are quoted daily in The Wall Street Journal. As with the others (except for the
                                       Dow Jones), this is also a cap-weighted index.


                                       Russell 2000 Index
                                       The Russell 2000 index measures the performance of the small-cap segment of the U.S. equity
                                       universe. It includes approximately 2,000 of the smallest securities, based upon their
                                       market capitalization (minimum market cap of $300 million). Like most of the others,
                                       it is market-cap weighted, with the median market cap being something approximating
                                       $600 million.

                                    The EAFE, sometimes referred to as the MSCI EAFE (it was developed by Morgan Stanley
                                    Capital International), is an index of foreign stocks. The index is market capitalization
                                    weighted. The EAFE acronym stands for Europe, Australasia, and the Far East.

                                    The index includes a selection of stocks from 21 developed countries outside of the
                                    United States and Canada. The index has been calculated since the end of 1969, making it the
                                    oldest truly international stock index. It is probably the most common benchmark for foreign
                                    stock funds.

             INTRODUCTION
                                    By this time in the course, you’re probably itching to go out and try some of these great
                                    strategies and techniques and get active in the market. In this unit, we’ll cover the first thing you
                                    have to do—decide what type of account you’re going to open. Then, we’ll discuss where the
                                    securities you wish to purchase or sell are traded. It isn’t like you can visit your local Walmart
                                    and pick up a few hundred shares of stock. Nor can you go online to Amazon and, even if you
                                    have Prime, order some bonds and have them delivered in two business days.


             LESSON 23.1: CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS
                                    LO 23.a Compare cash and margin accounts.

                                    Customers can open either cash accounts or margin accounts, depending on how they choose
                                    to pay for securities. In cash accounts, customers pay the full purchase price of securities by
                                    the transaction settlement date. In margin accounts, customers may borrow part of a security’s

                                        purchase price from the broker-dealer under terms set by Regulation T of the Federal Reserve
                                        Board (FRB). That power was given to the FRB in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.


                                        Cash Accounts
                                        A cash account is the basic investment account, and anyone eligible to open an investment
                                        account can open one. In a cash account, a customer must pay in full for any securities
                                        purchased. Although, there are exceptions, as with almost everything in this course, for exam
                                        purposes, certain accounts may only be opened as cash accounts, including:
                                         personal retirement accounts, such as IRAs;
                                         corporate retirement accounts;
                                         custodial accounts, such as Uniform Transfer to Minors Act accounts (UTMAs); and
                                         Coverdell ESAs.


                                        Margin Accounts
                                        Margin accounts allow customers to control investments for less money than they would
                                        need if they were to buy the securities outright, because a margin account allows a customer
                                        to borrow money for investing. The term margin refers to the minimum amount of cash or
                                        marginable securities a customer must deposit to buy securities.

                                        Margin also is a potential source of cash. If a customer has fully paid securities in an account
                                        and needs cash, a broker-dealer is permitted to lend money against those securities up to the
                                        margin limit that the FRB has set.

                                        Customers who open margin accounts must meet certain minimal suitability requirements.
                                        The customer may then buy securities on margin and pay interest on the borrowed funds. The
                                        securities purchased are held in street name as collateral for the margin loan.

                                        When buying on margin, investors are using financial leverage—that is, they are increasing
                                        the potential for gain (and for loss as well) by using borrowed funds. Leveraging can be
                                        beneficial when the security is moving up, but it can result in a loss greater than the original
                                        investment if the security goes against the investor.


                                        Marginable Securities
                                        In addition to prescribing the loan value of securities, Regulation T also identifies which
                                        securities are eligible for purchase on margin and which may be used as collateral for loans for
                                        other purchases. These are known as marginable securities. The following should be helpful.

                                        Securities that may be purchased on margin/used as collateral:
                                         Exchange-listed stocks and bonds
                                         Stocks traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market
                                         Warrants traded on either of the above
                                        Securities that cannot be purchased on margin/used as collateral:

                                    Securities that cannot be purchased on margin, but may be used as margin collateral once
                                    owned at least 30 days:
                                     Mutual funds
                                     New issues
                                    Finally, although they are exempt from Regulation T, the self-regulatory organizations,
                                    primarily FINRA, have established margin requirements for government and municipal
                                    securities. That means that they can also be purchased on margin and have value as collateral.


                                    Documenting a Margin Account
                                    Opening a margin account requires more documentation than opening a regular cash
                                    account. The customer signs a margin agreement, which includes the required credit
                                    agreement, the hypothecation agreement, and an optional loan consent. Under NASAA
                                    policies, it is an unethical business practice to execute any transaction in a margin account
                                    without securing from the customer a properly executed written margin agreement promptly
                                    after the initial transaction in the account.

                                    Credit          Discloses the terms under which credit is extended, including the use of the
                                    Agreement       client’s securities as collateral for the margin loan. SEC Rule 10b-16 requires
                                                    firms to disclose the method of computing interest and the conditions under
                                                    which interest rates and charges will be changed. Firms must send customers an
                                                    assurance that statements accounting for interest charges will be sent with the
                                                    same frequency that interest is charged (monthly or quarterly).

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              Although NASAA does not have one, FINRA rules (which most states view as
                                              practices to be followed by broker-dealers under their jurisdiction) do have a risk
                                              disclosure requirement for margin accounts. As part of opening a margin account,
                                              the broker-dealer must provide customers with a risk disclosure document. Unlike
                                              the “promptly after the initial trade” requirement that NASAA has for its required
                                              documentation, FINRA requires this document to be delivered prior to or at the time
                                              of opening the account. This information must also be provided to margin customers
                                              on an annual basis. The document discusses the risks associated with margin trading,

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     One of the agreements described above is the hypothecation agreement. In order to
                                                     finance the loan that the broker-dealer makes to the client, the firm takes the newly
                                                     purchased security and hypothecates (pledges) it to a bank to collateralize a loan
                                                     made by the bank to the BD. The broker call loan rate is the interest rate banks
                                                     charge broker-dealers on money they borrow to lend to margin account customers.
                                                     The broker call loan rate is also known as the call loan rate or call money rate. The
                                                     broker call loan rate usually is slightly higher than other short-term rates. Broker call
                                                     loans are callable on 24-hour notice. Invariably, call loan appears on the exam as one
                                                     of the incorrect choices.


                                        LO 23.b Compute the margin account calculations.

                                        The term margin call is properly defined as the initial call for funds when making a margin
                                        transaction. For example, with the margin requirements of the Federal Reserve Board’s
                                        Regulation T at 50% (as they have been since 1974), a purchase of $12,000 of stock will
                                        result in a margin call of $6,000. The broker-dealer lends the client the other $6,000, creating
                                        a debit balance in the account. The equity in the account is 50%, and the client’s debt is the
                                        other 50%.


                                        Maintenance
                                        The self-regulatory organizations (SROs) (e.g., FINRA and the NYSE), rather than the
                                        Fed through Regulation T, have established minimum levels of equity in a margin account
                                        below which a call will go out for additional funds. This is properly referred to as margin
                                        maintenance or a maintenance call. Current SRO levels are 25% for long margin accounts.
                                        For example, if, in the above purchase, the stock’s price were to drop to $8,000, there would
                                        only be $2,000 of equity in the account (market value of $8,000 minus debit balance of
                                        $6,000 equals $2,000). At this point, the equity represents 25% of the current market value
                                        ($2,000 / $8,000). If the stock should drop any further, a maintenance margin call would be
                                        sent with a request for immediate funds. You will not have to do any of these computations,
                                        but you will need to know the term. If the maintenance call is not met, the broker-dealer will
                                        liquidate enough securities in the account to bring the equity back to the maintenance level.
                                        If there is more than one security in the account, the firm can select which to sell—it does not
                                        have to be one whose decline triggered the call.


                                        House Maintenance
                                        This is the term used to describe stricter limits imposed by the broker-dealers themselves.
                                        Typically, instead of relying on the SRO maintenance level of 25%, the individual firm may
                                        require a minimum of 35% or even higher.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     This should help you remember the three terms we’ve just discussed:
                                                     Margin call: Set by the Federal Reserve Board under Regulation T, this is the initial
                                                     deposit required when purchasing securities on margin (the broker-dealer lends
                                                     the balance of the purchase price). For most equity securities, the initial margin
                                                     requirement is 50% of the purchase price.

                                                                                                      Unit 23   Trading Securities   563


                                              Minimum maintenance: Set by the SROs, this is the minimum equity that must be
                                              maintained in a margin account. Should the equity fall below the minimum required,
                                              a maintenance call (sometimes called maintenance margin) will go out demanding
                                              an immediate deposit of enough equity to bring the account above the required level.
                                              Currently, the minimum maintenance level for long positions is 25%.
                                              House maintenance: Set by the individual broker-dealer firm; as a cushion, and to
                                              reduce the possible sellout caused by failure to meet a maintenance call, most firms
                                              set a minimum equity level above the SRO minimum. A common house requirement is
                                              35%. Falling below triggers a house call.
                                              None of these numbers will be tested, only the concepts.


                                    Mixed Margin Account
                                    Later in this unit, we’ll describe the short sale. Short sales must take place in a margin
                                    account. When the margin account contains both long and short positions, it is said to be a
                                    mixed margin account. Computing the equity, sometimes called net equity, in one of these
                                    accounts is done by calculating the equity for both the longs and shorts and then combining
                                    them.

                                    In a long account, the equity is what you own, minus what you owe. That would be the
                                    current market value of the long stock minus the debit balance. In the case of the short
                                    position, it is basically the same, except the terms are different. What you owe in a short
                                    position is the cost to buy back the stock you’ve borrowed. What you own is the credit
                                    balance representing what you received when you sold the stock in the first place. So, the
                                    equity in a short account is the credit balance minus the current market value of the short
                                                                                                                                              Unit 23
                                    stock. Perhaps the following will make it a bit easier:

                                         CMV long – debit balance = long equity

                                         Credit balance – CMV short = short equity

                                    We have two positive numbers: the stock we own and the credit balance (you know that when
                                    you get a bill and there is a credit balance, it means they owe you money—that’s yours). On
                                    the other side, we have two negative numbers: the cost to buy back the stock we’re short and
                                    the debit balance. If we add the two positives and then subtract the two negatives, we’ve got
                                    our net equity.

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              A client’s mixed margin account shows the following information: the current market
                                              value of the long positions is $50,000, while the current market value of the short
                                              positions is $25,000. There is a debit balance of $20,000 and a credit balance of
                                              $40,000. What is the combined, or net, equity in the account?
                                              Find the equity in each account, long: $50,000 – $20,000 = $30,000 and short: $40,000 –
                                              $25,000 = $15,000, so the total is $45,000. Or take the two positive numbers, $50,000 +
                                              $40,000, which equal $90,000, and subtract the two negative numbers, $20,000 +
                                              $25,000, which equal $45,000, and you get the same: $45,000.


                                    Positive (Negative) Margin
                                    The term positive margin simply means that your returns are higher than the cost of the
                                    borrowed money to carry the positions in a margin account.

                                        of that purchase price from the broker-dealer. If, over the holding period, you pay $400 in
                                        interest and sell the stock for $11,000, you’ve made a profit of $1,000 against the cost of $400
                                        for net “winnings” of $600. That would be considered positive margin.

                                        If, however, you sold the stock for $10,300, your interest cost would have exceeded the profit
                                        by $100, and that would be considered negative margin.

                                        There is one more fact we need to cover about margin accounts. Margin interest is a
                                        tax-deductible expense. The one exception is interest expense incurred in the purchase of
                                        municipal securities. Because municipal interest income is federally tax exempt, the IRS does
                                        not allow taxpayers to deduct the margin interest expenses for municipal securities. Investors
                                        can deduct interest expenses incurred when borrowing money to purchase other securities
                                        to the extent those interest expenses do not exceed their portfolio income, which includes
                                        interest income, dividends, and all capital gains.

          LESSON 23.2: TYPES OF SECURITIES MARKETS

                                        LO 23.c Contrast stock exchanges and the over-the-counter market.


                                        Securities Markets
                                        There are two terms used to describe the market for securities. The primary market is the
                                        market in which the proceeds of sales go to the issuer of the securities sold. The secondary
                                        market is where previously issued securities are bought and sold. This unit will focus on
                                        secondary market trading.

                                        After the initial offering, many stocks and bonds are bought and sold on exchanges in
                                        a two-way auction process. The major exchanges include the New York Stock Exchange
                                        (NYSE), NYSE American LLC (formerly known as the American Stock Exchange [AMEX]),
                                        the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE), and the Nasdaq Stock Market. Other trades
                                        take place in the nationwide network of broker-dealers known as the over-the-counter (OTC)
                                        market.

                                    Exchange Market
                                    The exchange market is composed of the NYSE and other exchanges on which listed
                                    securities are traded. Listed security refers to any security listed for trading on an exchange.
                                    Each stock exchange requires corporations to meet certain criteria before it will allow their
                                    stock to be listed for trading on the exchange. In order to operate in the United States, an
                                    exchange must be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as called for in
                                    the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under that act, the SEC has many powers, including
                                    enforcement of the laws. Two specific actions that the SEC can take that might be tested are:
                                     to suspend trading in any nonexempt security for up to 10 days without prior notice; and
                                     to suspend trading on an entire exchange for up to 90 days (in order to do this, the SEC
                                       must give prior notification to the president of the United States).

                                    Location. Most stock exchanges, such as the NYSE, maintain central marketplaces and
                                    trading floors. Some, such as the Nasdaq Stock Market, are strictly electronic markets. As of
                                    the date of this printing, there are 21 exchanges registered as national stock exchanges with
                                    the SEC. At one time, there were a number of regional stock exchanges, but they have either
                                    been closed or merged into the national ones.

                                    Pricing system. Historically, listed markets operated as auction markets. Floor brokers
                                    competed to execute trades at the most favorable prices. That process still exists on some
                                    exchanges.

                                    Specialist. The specialist maintains an orderly market and provides price continuity. He fills
                                    limit and market orders for the public and trades for his own account to either stabilize or
                                    facilitate trading when imbalances in supply and demand occur.

                                    The specialist’s chief function is to maintain a fair and orderly market in the stocks for which        Unit 23
                                    he is responsible. An additional function is to minimize price disparities that may occur at the
                                    opening of daily trading. He does this by buying or selling, as a dealer, stock from his own
                                    inventory only when a need for such intervention exists. Otherwise, the specialist lets public
                                    supply and demand set the stock’s price.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              The term specialist has been replaced with designated market maker (DMM), but it is
                                              possible to still see specialist on your exam.


                                    Over-the-Counter (OTC) Market
                                    The OTC market functions as an interdealer market in which unlisted securities—that is,
                                    securities not listed on any exchange—trade.

                                    In the OTC market, securities dealers across the country are connected by computer and
                                    telephone. Thousands of securities are traded OTC, including stocks, corporate bonds, and all
                                    municipal and U.S. government securities. One of the best-known of the OTC markets are
                                    those operated by the OTC Markets Group. An example of them is the Pink Market, which
                                    for many years was known as the Pink Sheets because the quotes were printed on pink-colored
                                    paper. These tend to include those stocks that are thinly traded (little trading activity) with
                                    higher than normal spreads.

                                    Location. No central marketplace facilitates OTC trading. Trading takes place over the
                                    phone, over computer networks, and in trading rooms across the country.

                                        compete to post the best bid and ask prices. The OTC market is a negotiated market.

                                        the minimum trading unit, usually 100 shares (or any larger amount they have indicated), in
                                        each stock in which they have published bid and ask quotes. Market makers, acting in a dealer
                                        (principal) capacity, sell from their inventory at their asking price and buy for their inventory
                                        at the bid price.

                                        acting as a dealer.

                                        Most securities firms act as both brokers and dealers, but never in the same transaction. Let’s
                                        examine the differences between these two terms.

                                    Brokers
                                    When a broker-dealer acts in the capacity of a broker, it is said to be acting in an agency capacity.
                                    That is, the firm represents clients who wish to buy a security by finding a seller, or finding a
                                    buyer for those clients with a security to sell. For this service, they charge a commission.

                                    Brokers do not buy shares for inventory but facilitate trades between buyers and sellers.

                                    When a broker-dealer acts in the capacity of a dealer, it is said to be acting as a principal in the
                                    trade. Just as with any transaction, there are always two principals: the buyer and the seller.
                                    Dealers, acting as principals, buy and sell securities for their own account. When they receive
                                    a customer order to buy a security, they sell that security out of their inventory in the same
                                    manner as an automobile dealer sells you a car off the lot. When they receive a customer order
                                    to sell, dealers buy that security for their inventory, once again similar to an automobile dealer
                                    who buys your old clunker from you.

                                               TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                               Disclosure of the capacity in which the broker-dealer acted is always required on the
                                               trade confirmation.

                                    Trading Costs
                                    Commissions
                                    Buying and selling securities is not without cost. As described above, there are two ways in
                                    which broker-dealers function: as brokers or as dealers. As brokers, they are acting as their
                                    client’s agents, and, as is typical in any business, agents charge a commission for their service.

                                    In other words, when an investor buys a security, the broker’s commission will be added to the
                                    investor’s purchase price. Likewise, when an investor sells a security, the broker’s commission
                                    will be deducted from the investor’s proceeds.


                                    Markup and Markdown
                                    When selling from their inventories, dealers charge the buying customers a markup rather
                                    than a commission. When buying for their inventory, dealers charge the selling customers a
                                    markdown (they buy for less than they can sell it for—think about what happens when the
                                    auto dealer buys your used car from you and what it sells for on the lot a week later after
                                    they’ve cleaned it up).

                                               TAKE NOTE
                                               The term principal has several meanings in the securities industry. A broker-dealer acts as a
                                               principal in a dealer transaction. A principal of a firm is a person who acts in a supervisory
                                               capacity. Principal can also mean the face value of a bond or an asset in a trust.
                                               A firm cannot act as both a broker and a dealer in the same transaction.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     A firm cannot make a market in a stock, mark up that stock, and then add an agency
                                                     commission. If the firm acts as a broker, it may charge a commission. If it acts as
                                                     a dealer, it may charge a markup or markdown. Violation of this practice is called
                                                     making a hidden profit.

                                                                     Broker                                          Dealer

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     An easy way to remember these relationships is to memorize the following letters.
                                                     BAC/DPP—Brokers act as Agents for Commissions/Dealers act as Principals for
                                                     Profits.
                                                     ABCD—Agents that are Brokers for Commissions that must be Disclosed.

                                                     PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                         When viewing several of your client’s trade confirmations, you notice that a recent
                                                         purchase was made of ABC stock where there was no commission indicated, while
                                                         a sale took place of DEF stock in which the commission listed was $55. From this
                                                         information you could determine that
                                                            I. ABC was purchased in an agency transaction.
                                                           II. ABC was purchased in a principal transaction.
                                                          III. DEF was sold in an agency transaction.
                                                          IV. DEF was sold in a principal transaction.
                                                           A. I and III
                                                           B. I and IV
                                                           C. II and III
                                                           D. II and V
                                                         Answer: C. Whenever a trade is made without a commission indicated on the
                                                         confirmation, it means that a markup or markdown was charged. That makes it
                                                         a dealer or principal transaction. Commissions are always disclosed on agency
                                                         transactions. Therefore, we know that ABC (II) was purchased in a principal
                                                         transaction and DEF (III) was sold in an agency transaction, so the correct match is
                                                         choice C.


                                        Bids, Offers, and Quotes
                                        A firm quote is a market maker’s current bid and offer on a security. The current bid is the
                                        highest price at which the dealer will buy, and the current offer is the lowest price at which
                                        the dealer will sell. The difference between the bid and ask is known as the spread. A general
                                        rule is: “The more active the stock, the narrower the spread.” This concept plays out in our
                                        everyday life because those products that move off the shelves quickly (think about milk,
                                        eggs, and bread in the grocery store) tend to have a lower retail markup than items that move

                                    slowly, such as antiques and fine art. We have mentioned earlier that higher markups or
                                    commissions on thinly traded (not highly active) securities would generally not be in violation
                                    as long as they are properly disclosed.

                                    In most cases, a market maker’s quote will also include the size—that indicates the number of
                                    shares the quote is good for. For example, a quote of 45 – 45.20 8 × 10 means that the dealer
                                    is offering 1000 shares for sale at 45.20 and is ready to buy 800 shares at 45. If not stated,
                                    the quote is firm for a single round lot (100 shares). Remember, when acting in a principal
                                    capacity, there are no commissions added.

                                    This should help you regarding the prices received or paid by BDs and investors:

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   If WXYZ is quoted as 43.25 to .50, it means that the bid price (the price that a customer
                                                   would receive for her shares) is $43.25, and the ask price (the price that the customer
                                                   would pay to buy shares) is $43.50. The $.25 difference is the dealer’s spread.
                                                   Alternatively, the exam might put it like this:
                                                   A broker-dealer quotes a stock 42 to a half. The difference between these two
                                                   numbers is known as

                                                    B. the dealer’s markup.
                                                    C. the profit margin.
                                                    D. the spread.
                                                   Answer: D. The dealer’s quote represents the bid and the offer (ask) prices. This
                                                   quote is 42 bid and 42.50 offered. The difference between these two is the spread.
                                                   Markup is added to the higher price (the ask or offering price).

                                              If a client has U.S. Treasury bonds she wishes to sell and receives a quote of 104.22,
                                              which represents the bid price, don’t select an answer choice that says “a premium”.
                                              It is a premium, but that is not as good an answer.

                                        Many types of orders are available to customers. The type will be indicated on the order ticket.
                                        SEC rules require preparation of order tickets before order entry. Required disclosures include:
                                         the account number;
                                         whether the order is solicited, unsolicited, or discretionary (including time or price);
                                         if a sale, whether long or short;
                                         the terms and conditions of the order (market, limit, or stop);
                                         the number of shares if a stock, and if a bond, aggregate par value (but not rating or

                                         the time of order entry (execution time and execution price will be added); and
                                         the name of the broker-dealer and identity of the registered individual who accepted the
                                           order or is responsible for the account.

                                                   Which of the following types of orders does not restrict the price at which an order is
                                                   executed?

                                                   Answer: C. A market order does not reflect or restrict the price at which a security is
                                                   executed. A limit order limits the amount to be paid or received for securities. A stop
                                                   order becomes a market order if the stock reaches or goes through the stop price.
                                                   A stop limit order becomes a limit order if the stock hits or goes through the trigger
                                                   price.


                                    Market Orders
                                    A market order is sent immediately to the floor for execution without restrictions or limits.
                                    It is executed immediately at the current market price and has priority over all other types of
                                    orders. A market order to buy is executed at the lowest offering price available; a market order

                                                                                                                                                   Unit 23
                                    to sell is executed at the highest bid price available. Those prices are usually referred to as
                                    the inside market or inside quote. As long as the security is trading, a market order guarantees
                                    execution.


                                    Limit Orders
                                    In a limit order, a customer limits the acceptable purchase or selling price. A limit order
                                    can be executed only at the specified price or better. Better means lower in a buy order and
                                    higher in a sell order. If the order cannot be executed at the market, the order is left with the
                                    specialist (now called the DMM), who records the trade in the order book and executes the
                                    order if and when the market price meets the limit order price.

                                    A customer who enters a limit order risks missing the chance to buy or sell, especially if the
                                    market moves away from the limit price. The market price may never go as low as the buy
                                    limit price or as high as the sell limit price.

                                               TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                               If any part of an order can be filled at the limit price, it is done. For example, if a day
                                               limit order to buy 400 shares at $22.45 is turned in and all that can be executed at that
                                               price or better is 200 shares before the market closes, that sale is confirmed and the
                                               order for the balance is canceled.

                                        Short Sales
                                        Selling short is a technique to profit from the decline in a stock’s price. The short seller
                                        initially borrows stock from a broker-dealer to sell at the market. The investor expects the
                                        stock price to decline enough to allow him to buy shares at a lower price and replace the
                                        borrowed stock at a later date. Unless the stock price declines to zero, the short seller is
                                        obligated to buy the stock and replace the borrowed shares to close the short position. Because
                                        of this “borrowing,” a margin deposit is required. Therefore, short sales can only take place in
                                        a margin account.

                                        Short sales are risky because if the stock price rises instead of falls, an investor still must buy
                                        the shares to replace the borrowed stock—and a stock’s price can rise without limit. Therefore,
                                        the position has unlimited risk.


                                        Stop Orders
                                        A stop order, also known as a stop loss order, may be entered to protect a profit or prevent a
                                        loss if the stock begins to move in the wrong direction.
                                        The stop order becomes a market order once the stock trades at or moves through a certain
                                        price known as the stop price. Stop orders for listed stocks are usually left with and executed
                                        by the specialist (DMM).

                                        A trade at or through (lower in the case of a sell stop; higher in the case of a buy stop) the stop
                                        price triggers the order, which then becomes a market order. As a market order, there is no
                                        assurance of any specific price. The order may wind up being executed at, above, or below the
                                        stop price.

                                        A stop order takes two trades to execute:
                                         Trigger—the trigger transaction at or through the stop price activates the trade
                                         Execution—the stop order becomes a market order and is executed at the market price,
                                           completing the trade


                                        Stop Limit Order
                                        A stop limit order is a stop order that, once triggered, becomes a limit order instead of a
                                        market order.

                                                     EXAMPLE
                                                     An order that reads “sell 100 COD at 52 stop, 51.50 limit” means that the stop will be
                                                     activated at or below 52. Because a 51.50 limit applies, the order to sell cannot be
                                                     executed below 51.50.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     The uses of buy and sell stop orders are summarized below.

                                                   (i.e., stock prices decline below low level)


                                    Mechanics of a Stop Order
                                    As stated above, it takes more than one trade for a stop order to be executed. The first of
                                    those, the trigger, occurs whenever the subject security trades at or through the stop price. In
                                    the case of a buy stop order, through means at a higher price. In the case of a sell stop order,
                                    through means at a lower price.

                                    Then, once the order has been triggered, unless it is a stop limit order, the next price in the
                                    market is the one at which the trade is executed. It will probably be easier to follow if we
                                    display an example.

                                              EXAMPLE
                                              A client enters a buy stop order for 100 shares of XYZ at 40. Trades then occur at 38, 39,
                                              39.90, 40.05, 40.10, and 39.78. What price did the client pay for the stock? The order
                                              will be triggered as soon as the price gets to 40 or higher. That would be the trade at
                                              40.05. At that time, a market order is entered and the client pays the next price (which
                                              could be more or less than 40). In this case, the next price is 40.10, and that is the price
                                              per share paid by the client (we’re ignoring any commissions).
                                              How is this different for a stop limit order? If we change the above example to make                    Unit 23
                                              the order, buy stop at 40, limit 40, then the client is stating that once the order has
                                              been triggered, enter a limit order and do not pay any more than 40 for the stock.
                                              Once again, the order is triggered with the trade at 40.05, but now, because a limit
                                              order has been placed, we can’t buy on the next trade—40.10 is too high. However, the
                                              following trade at 39.78 allows us to meet the client’s limit of paying no more than 40
                                              for the stock.

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   A client order is received with the following instructions: Buy stop 100 shares ABC
                                                   at 34, limit 34.20. After the order is submitted, trades occur at 33, 33.90, 34.10, 33.85,
                                                   34.05, and 34.25. More than likely, the client paid
                                                    A. 33.85.
                                                    B. 34.05.
                                                    C. 34.10.
                                                    D. 34.25.
                                                   Answer: A. This is two orders in one. The first does not become triggered until
                                                   the price gets as high as 34 or higher. That happens at 34.10. Once triggered, a buy
                                                   limit order at 34.20 is entered (pay 34.20 or less), and the trade at 33.85 meets that
                                                   requirement.

                                        Capping: This is the act of entering sell orders in a stock for the purpose of keeping the
                                        stock from rising above the sale price when one is short the stock. If successful, the stock will
                                        stay below the strike price and the short position will be profitable. The opposite of this is
                                        supporting, where purchase orders are entered in an attempt to keep the price of a stock from
                                        falling when one has a long position.

                                        Pegging: This is a generic term that applies to any activity intended to keep the price of a
                                        stock from moving. This can involve entering either buy or sell orders or both. For example, a
                                        short straddle writer will profit most if the stock price and strike prices of the position are the
                                        same at expiration—that is, the short options are right at-the-money.

                                                     TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                     There is a danger in using stop orders in that once they are triggered, the marketplace
                                                     receives an increase of sell orders in a falling market and buy orders in a rising market.
                                                     This can have the tendency to accelerate the direction of the market: sell stops in a
                                                     bearish market, or buy stops in a bullish one.

                                                     TAKE NOTE
                                                     An interesting legal question arises when an agent becomes aware of MNPI after a stop
                                                     order is triggered, but prior to execution. Unless the agent has reason to suspect that
                                                     the client was acting on that information, the order can proceed as normal because it
                                                     was received prior to the agent becoming aware of the information.


                                        Block Trade
                                        NYSE Rule 72 defines a “block” as at least 10,000 shares or $200,000 USD, whichever is
                                        less. Thus, for stocks priced at less than $20, a 10,000-share trade can be a block, but in
                                        higher-priced stocks even a 1,000-share trade could constitute a block.


                                        LO 23.g Describe high frequency trading (HFT) and dark pools.


                                        High Frequency Trading
                                        Over the past 10 years, high frequency trading (HFT) has gone from a small, niche strategy
                                        in financial markets to the dominant form of trading. It currently accounts for well over half
                                        of the trading volume in U.S. equity markets and 40% in European equity markets, and
                                        is quickly growing in Asian, fixed-income, commodity, foreign exchange, and nearly every
                                        other market. Although a precise definition of HFT does not exist, it is generally classified
                                        as autonomous computerized trading that seeks quick profits using high-speed connections
                                        to financial exchanges. The objective of HFT is to take advantage of minute discrepancies in
                                        prices and trade on them quickly and in huge quantities. As computers get more technically
                                        advanced, trading practices have increased in size, and algorithms have become more
                                        sophisticated. The trades are done at close to the speed of light. In fact, HFT firms have
                                        moved their servers to be near an exchange computer to further increase trading speeds.

                                        Regulators across the globe are spending considerable effort deciding if and how to regulate
                                        HFT. On the one hand, HFT appears to make markets more efficient. Algorithmic trading
                                        in general, and HFT specifically, increases the accuracy of prices and lowers transaction costs.

                                    On the other hand, HFT appears to make the financial system as a whole more fragile. The
                                    rapid fall and subsequent rise in prices that occurred in U.S. markets on May 6, 2010 (known
                                    as the Flash Crash, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged about 1,000 points in a
                                    matter of minutes) was, in part, due to HFT. Because HFT firms do not openly disclose their
                                    trading activities, it has so far been unclear how and why HFT produces these outcomes—a
                                    circumstance that has greatly increased the controversy surrounding its existence.

                                    A typical objective of high frequency traders is to identify and capture minute price
                                    discrepancies present in the market. They do so with no human intervention, using computers
                                    to automatically capture and read market data in real time, transmit thousands of order
                                    messages per second to an exchange, and execute, cancel, or replace orders based on new
                                    information on prices or demand. In most cases, the trades are executed before individual
                                    investors know the quotes of prices or that the trades happened at all. For example, a computer
                                    recognizes when one exchange quotes an ask price of one cent more than the quote on another
                                    exchange. This computer then trades in extraordinarily large volumes on this information,
                                    taking advantage of the arbitrage opportunity in a split second. Before individual and other
                                    investors who do not possess the same sophisticated technology realize it, the one-cent spread
                                    between the two exchanges is erased and the stock price trades at the same level.


                                    Benefits of HFT
                                     Increased liquidity in the markets, especially for more active stocks
                                     Market efficiency—price differences are arbitraged away, leading to narrower spreads
                                     Reduced costs, especially for institutional purchasers such as mutual funds

                                                                                                                                               Unit 23
                                    Negatives of HFT
                                     Market manipulation—with the huge volume that can be generated, HFT traders
                                       entering phony trades that are later canceled can prompt market activity that would not
                                       have happened had these HFT traders not manipulated the market to their advantage
                                     Harm to small investors—they do not have access to the same trading information
                                       anywhere near as soon as the HFT traders
                                     “Snowballing” effect of HFT—for years, one of the problems with stop orders was the
                                       acceleration of a downward move when sell stop orders were triggered. With HFT, the
                                       volume is so much greater that this movement, as we saw in the Flash Crash, has been
                                       magnified.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              HFTs rely on very low latency for their algorithmic trading schemes. Low latency is just
                                              a fancy way of saying quick trading. It’s not unusual nowadays to have a DMA (direct
                                              market access) customer enter and have executed 5,000 or 6,000 orders or more in
                                              one second. Trades are being executed and reported in microseconds. HFT customers
                                              are the most likely customers to be provided by their broker-dealers with DMA, which
                                              bypasses the firm’s trading desk. This kind of DMA trading is called low or “no-touch.”
                                              No-touch doesn’t mean no obligation; the broker-dealers still have an obligation to
                                              monitor their DMA customer’s behavior. No broker-dealer can throw its hands up and
                                              say to the regulators, “We didn’t know what they were doing.”

                                        Dark pools, sometimes referred to as dark pools of liquidity or simply dark liquidity, are
                                        trading volume that occurs or liquidity that is not openly available to the public. The bulk of
                                        this volume represents trades engaged in by institutional traders and trading desks away from
                                        the exchange markets. Generally, these are large-volume transactions that occur on crossing
                                        networks or alternative trading systems (ATS) that match buy and sell orders electronically
                                        for execution without routing the order to an exchange or other market where quote, last sale
                                        price, and volume information is displayed.

                                        Institutional trading desks that choose to use dark pools are able to execute large block orders
                                        without impacting public quotes or price, or revealing their investment strategy regarding
                                        any of their holding accumulations or divestitures. Additionally, orders can be placed
                                        anonymously so that the identity of the entity placing the order is unknown to the general
                                        investing public, along with the volume and price for the transaction. The concern with
                                        dark pools is that some market participants are left disadvantaged because they cannot see
                                        the trades, volume, or prices agreed upon within the pools, and thus market transparency is
                                        darkened.

                                        Dark pools account for about 17% of the trading volume in the U.S. stock market. Here are
                                        some points you should try to remember about dark pools:


                                        Benefits of Dark Pools
                                        Orders entered can’t be seen by other market participants before the trade occurs; there is no
                                        risk of information leakage.
                                         An execution venue with high pre-trade transparency is called a lit venue (e.g., national
                                           stock exchanges).


                                        Negatives of Dark Pools
                                        Traders can’t see orders on the other side of the trade, so they do not know the pre-trade
                                        likelihood of execution.

             INTRODUCTION
                                    In Unit 3, we discussed a number of different pooled investment vehicles. In this unit, we’re
                                    going to cover two more: variable annuities and variable life insurance. But those are not the
                                    only insurance-based products that are relevant to this exam. Even though the others we’ll
                                    discuss are not securities, understanding what they are and their basic features are testable items.


             LESSON 24.1: WHAT ARE ANNUITIES?
                                    Although many products offered by insurance companies are not securities, the securities
                                    professional should be aware of the features of both securities and nonsecurities offerings.

                                        LO 24.a Contrast fixed and variable annuities.


                                        Annuities
                                        An annuity is generally a contract between an individual and a life insurance company,
                                        usually purchased for retirement income. An investor, the annuitant, pays the premium
                                        in one lump sum or in periodic payments. At a future date, the annuitant can either elect
                                        to surrender the policy and receive a lump-sum payout or begin receiving regular income
                                        distributions that will continue for life.

                                        Because all earnings are tax deferred, many individuals looking to accumulate additional funds
                                        for retirement find annuities to be a valuable tool. Unlike IRAs and qualified retirement plans
                                        (covered in Unit 18) that limit the amount that can be contributed, there is no legal limit
                                        to the amount that can be invested in an annuity (the insurance company may place a limit,
                                        generally in the range of $1–$3 million, that it will accept).

                                        Annuity contracts are classified into two major types (depending on the guarantees offered):
                                         fixed annuities; and
                                         variable annuities.

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   For exam purposes, every annuity is nonqualified (contributions are made with
                                                   after-tax dollars) unless stated otherwise.


                                        Fixed Annuities
                                        A fixed annuity guarantees a fixed rate of return. When the individual elects to begin
                                        receiving income, the payout is determined by the account’s value and the annuitant’s life
                                        expectancy based on mortality tables. A fixed annuity payout remains constant throughout
                                        the annuitant’s life. Although principal and interest are not at risk, a fixed annuity risks loss of
                                        purchasing power because of inflation.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   Because the insurance company guarantees the return and the annuitant bears no
                                                   risk, a fixed annuity is an insurance product and not a security. A salesperson must
                                                   have a life insurance license to sell fixed annuities but does not need to be securities
                                                   licensed.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   An individual who annuitized a contract in 1990 may have been guaranteed a monthly
                                                   payout of $800. Decades later, this amount may prove insufficient to live on.


                                        Variable Annuities
                                        Instead of purchase payments being directed to the insurance company’s general account,
                                        money deposited in a variable annuity is directed into one or more subaccounts of the
                                        company’s separate account. Although the options include money market securities and
                                        bonds, purchase payments are frequently invested in a stock portfolio, which has a better
                                        chance of keeping pace with inflation than fixed-income investments.

                                    The greater potential gain of a variable annuity involves more potential risk than a fixed
                                    annuity because it invests in securities rather than accepting the insurance company’s
                                    guarantees. Payouts may vary considerably, because an annuity unit’s worth fluctuates with the
                                    value of the selected subaccount(s).

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   The key difference between a fixed annuity and a variable annuity is that the fixed
                                                   annuity
                                                    A. offers a guaranteed return.
                                                    B. offers a monthly payment that may vary in amount.
                                                    C. will always pay out more money than a variable annuity.
                                                    D. attempts to offer protection to the annuitant from inflation risk.
                                                   Answer: A. If an annuity is fixed, it means the return to the investor is guaranteed,
                                                   whereas with a variable annuity, there are no guarantees as to the amount of return.
                                                   It is the variable annuity whose annuity payment will vary and, because of the growth
                                                   opportunity, offers potential inflation protection.


                                    Separate Account
                                    The contributions that investors make to a variable annuity are kept in a separate account
                                    from the insurance company’s general funds. Some insurance company’s separate accounts
                                    offer 25, 30, or even more subaccounts, from the most aggressive to the most conservative.

                                                                                                                                                Unit 24
                                    Investors determine the subaccounts into which their money will be placed.

                                    Because the investor rather than the insurance company bears the risk, a variable annuity is
                                    considered to be a security. As a consequence, variable annuity salespersons must have both a
                                    securities license (registered with a broker-dealer member of FINRA and the applicable state
                                    or states) and an insurance license issued by the appropriate state(s).

                                              It is the performance of the specific subaccount(s) selected by the investor that
                                              determines the investment return.

                                        LO 24.b Compare variable annuities and mutual funds.

                                        In the eyes of many novice investors, there doesn’t seem to be very much difference between
                                        a mutual fund and a variable annuity. Although there are many similarities, there are critical
                                        differences. The following chart is a good place to begin.

                                        Looking at the above chart, there doesn’t seem to be much difference other than one being an
                                        insurance product with some guarantees and the other not. The following discussion applies
                                        to nonqualified annuities—those which are not included in a qualified retirement plan such as
                                        the 403(b) plan covered in Unit 18. Let’s look a bit deeper:


                                        Advantages of Investing in Variable Annuities Compared to
                                        Mutual Funds
                                         Tax-deferred growth: All income and capital gains generated in the portfolio of the
                                           separate account are free from income tax until the money is withdrawn. Over time, this
                                           tax-deferred compounding can make a significant difference in the value of the account.
                                         Guaranteed death benefit: Most variable annuities offer an option stating that if the
                                           investor dies during the accumulation period, the beneficiary will receive the greater of
                                           the current value of the account or the amount invested. Therefore, the estate is assured of
                                           getting back at least the original investment.
                                         Lifetime income: Although a variable annuity cannot guarantee how much will be paid,
                                           choosing a payout option with lifetime benefits gives assurance that there will be a check
                                           every month as long as the annuitant is alive. This benefit protects against longevity risk,
                                           the uncertainty that one will outlive one’s money. Be sure that you don’t refer to this as
                                           guaranteed income—that would be an incorrect statement on the exam, because the
                                           income is variable.
                                         IRS Section 1035 exchanges: If you don’t like the annuity you’re in, you can exchange
                                           into another one without any tax consequences. However, it is possible there will be a
                                           surrender charge. This is unlike mutual funds, for which use of the exchange privilege is a
                                           taxable event.
                                         No age restrictions or requirements: Unlike traditional retirement plans that have required
                                           minimum distributions after the age of 72, an investor can delay withdrawals as desired
                                           and, in fact, can continue to contribute. Please note that annuities are always nonqualified
                                           unless something in the exam question indicates otherwise.
                                         No contribution limits: Unlike retirement plans, where the annual contribution is
                                           limited, no IRS ceiling is placed on the amount that may be invested into a fixed or
                                           variable annuity.

                                     Tax-free transfer between subaccounts: Unlike mutual funds, where the exchange between
                                       funds is a taxable event, the investor can transfer from one subaccount to another without
                                       any current tax liability.
                                     No probate: Because the annuity calls for direct designation of a beneficiary, upon death,
                                       the asset passes directly without the time and expense of probate.


                                    Disadvantages of Investing in Variable Annuities Compared to
                                    Mutual Funds
                                     Earnings are taxed as ordinary income. Even though it is possible that the majority of the
                                       increase in value is generated through long-term capital gains, all earnings will be taxed at
                                       the higher ordinary income rate.
                                     The administrative and insurance-related expense fees are typically much higher than the
                                       fees incurred by owning a mutual fund.
                                     Withdrawals made before age 59½ will generally incur a 10% penalty, in addition to the
                                       ordinary income tax on that portion of the withdrawal representing the earnings.
                                     Most variable annuities carry a conditional deferred (surrender) sales charge. Therefore,
                                       surrender in the early years will usually involve additional costs.

                                              TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                              A variable annuity offers an investor the opportunity to have tax-deferred participation
                                              in the equity markets, albeit with expenses that are generally higher than for a mutual
                                              fund with a similar objective.

                                              PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   The Test Topic Alert shown above represents an idea that is commonly tested. It
                                                   could look something like this:
                                                   When comparing mutual funds and variable annuities, it would be correct to state
                                                   that
                                                     A. both offer tax-deferred growth of earnings.
                                                    B. both require that the salesperson possess a securities license and an
                                                        insurance license.
                                                    C. the surrender charges on a mutual fund are usually higher than on a variable
                                                        annuity.
                                                                                                                                               Unit 24
                                                    D. the expense ratio of the variable annuity is usually higher than that of a
                                                        comparable mutual fund.
                                                   Answer: D. It is generally correct to state that variable annuities offer a way to
                                                   accumulate funds on a tax-deferred basis, although generally with operating
                                                   expenses somewhat higher than mutual funds with the same investment objective.
                                                   There is no tax deferral with mutual funds, and an insurance license is not required to
                                                   sell them. Only Class B and C shares have back-end fees, a form of surrender charge,
                                                   and they are invariable lower and/or run for fewer years than annuity surrender
                                                   charges.

          LESSON 24.2: INDEX ANNUITIES
                                       LO 24.c Calculate the account return for an index annuity.


                                       Index Annuity
                                       In an effort to overcome the purchasing power risk of fixed annuities, but without the market
                                       risk of the variable annuity, the industry developed the index annuity (IA). This product is
                                       sometimes called an equity index annuity or a fixed index annuity.

                                       Indexed annuities (IAs) are currently popular among investors seeking market participation
                                       with a guarantee against loss. Unlike a traditional fixed annuity, an index annuity credits
                                       interest to the owner’s account using a formula based on the performance of a particular stock
                                       index, such as the S&P 500. If the index does well, the annuitant is credited with a specified
                                       percentage of the growth of the index—typically 80% or 90% of the growth. This is known as
                                       the participation rate. If, over the life of the annuity, the index does poorly, the annuitant may
                                       receive the IA’s minimum guaranteed return—typically 1 to 3%.

                                       In addition to the participation rate, there is usually a cap rate. A typical cap might be 8%.
                                       This means that if your annuity was pegged to the S&P 500 and that index increased 20%
                                       during the year, your gain would be capped at 8%. One other negative characteristic of these
                                       products is that they tend to have longer surrender charge periods (as long as 15 years) than
                                       other annuities, especially if there is a front-end bonus.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   To give you an idea of how an index annuity might work, consider one with a
                                                   participation rate of 80%, a cap rate of 8%, and a minimum guarantee of 2%. If the
                                                   index shows growth of 9% during the index annuity’s measurement period, the
                                                   annuitant would be credited with 7.2% growth (80% of 9%, which is less than the cap
                                                   of 8%). However, if the index grew at a rate of 12%, the participation rate of 80% would
                                                   yield 9.6%, but, because that is over the 8% cap, the account would only be credited
                                                   with 8%. In any year where the index declines, the annuitant’s account is not credited

                                    with any earnings, but—and this is the real benefit—the account does not lose any
                                    value either. The 2% guaranteed rate would apply if, over the term of the annuity,
                                    performance was less than 2%.

                                    TAKE NOTE
                                    Although index annuity is the preferred term in the industry, your exam may refer to
                                    this product as an equity index annuity.

                                    TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                    In NASAA’s never-ending battle to try to baffle potential investment adviser
                                    representatives with questions about products they will most likely never handle, we
                                    are hearing from students that you should know the different crediting methods used
                                    for index annuities.
                                    Without going into the technicalities (it seems all you have to know is the different
                                    types, not a lot about how they work), the purchaser can be offered the following
                                    choices as to how growth in the underlying index will be credited in the form of
                                    interest to the account:
                                    1.   Annual reset. In this method, the interest to be credited to the account is
                                         computed by comparing the index value at the end of the year to the value at the
                                         beginning of the year (hence the term annual). Annual reset generally has a lower
                                         participation rate than point-to-point.
                                    2.   High-water mark. In this method, the highest value reached by the index between
                                         anniversary dates of the annuity is compared to the value at the beginning of the
                                         year. This option can provide the greatest gain.
                                    3.   Point-to-point. In this method, the interest is computed based on the value of the
                                         index at the end of the contract compared to the beginning.
                                    4.   Averaging. The most common is a monthly average, and this can be the best
                                         option when markets are expected to be highly volatile.

          LESSON 24.3: PURCHASING AND WITHDRAWING FROM ANNUITIES
                                       LO 24.d Compare the different purchase and settlement options for
                                       annuities.


                                       Purchasing Annuities
                                       Insurance companies offer a number of purchase options to make it easy for annuity owners
                                       to accumulate money.


                                       Deferred Annuity
                                       An annuity may be purchased with a single lump-sum investment (with payout of benefits
                                       deferred until the annuitant elects to receive them). This type of investment is referred to as a
                                       single-premium deferred annuity.


                                       Periodic Payment Deferred Annuity
                                       A periodic payment deferred annuity allows a person to make periodic payments. The
                                       contract holder can invest money on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis (with payout of
                                       benefits deferred until the annuitant elects to receive them).


                                       Accumulation Stage
                                       The pay-in period for a deferred annuity is known as the accumulation stage (there is no
                                       accumulation period for an immediate annuity). During the accumulation stage of an annuity
                                       contract, the contract terms are flexible. An investor who misses a periodic payment is in no
                                       danger of forfeiting the preceding contributions.

                                       The contract holder can terminate the contract at any time during the accumulation stage,
                                       although the contract holder is likely to incur surrender charges on amounts withdrawn in the
                                       first 5 to 10 years after issuance of the contract.


                                       Accumulation Units
                                       An accumulation unit is an accounting measure that represents an investor’s share of
                                       ownership in the separate account. An accumulation unit’s value is determined in the same
                                       way as the value of mutual fund shares. The unit value changes with the value of the securities
                                       held in the separate account.


                                       Immediate Annuity
                                       An investor may purchase an immediate annuity contract by depositing a single lump
                                       sum. The insurance company begins to pay out the annuity’s benefits immediately—usually
                                       within 60 days. Unlike deferred annuities, there is no accumulation stage, so there are no
                                       accumulation units. The deposit acquires annuity units only.

                                       The names of various purchase options are quite descriptive of how they operate and should
                                       not be difficult to follow. Just to be sure, let’s try the following question:

                                                     B. Single-premium deferred annuity—an annuity with a lump-sum investment,
                                                         with payment of benefits deferred until the annuitant elects to receive them
                                                     C. Periodic payment deferred annuity—allows a person to make periodic
                                                         payments over time; the contract holder can invest money on a monthly,
                                                         quarterly, or annual basis
                                                     D. Immediate annuity—allows an investor to deposit a lump sum with the
                                                         insurance company; payout of the annuitant’s benefits starts immediately,
                                                         usually within 60 days
                                                   Answer: A. Accumulation does not refer to a purchase option. The pay-in period for
                                                   an annuity is known as the accumulation stage. A single-premium deferred annuity is
                                                   an annuity with a lump-sum investment, with payment of benefits deferred until the
                                                   annuitant elects to receive them. Periodic payment deferred annuities allow a person
                                                   to make periodic payments over time. Immediate annuities allow an investor to
                                                   deposit a lump sum with the insurance company payout of the annuitant’s benefits
                                                   starting immediately, usually within 60 days.


                                    Bonus Annuities
                                    It is not uncommon for index annuities (and variable annuities) to offer a “bonus” on top
                                    of the investor’s initial contribution. For example, investing $60,000 into a single premium
                                    annuity with a 5% bonus would result in an account balance of $63,000. Usually, bonus
                                    annuities have surrender charges lasting longer than those without the bonus.


                                    Receiving Distributions from Annuities
                                    The payout period for an annuity is known as the annuity stage. It happens when the owner
                                    of the annuity annuitizes.


                                    Annuity Payout Options
                                    It is now time for the contract holder to decide on the settlement option. An annuity offers                Unit 24
                                    several payout options for amounts accumulated in the annuity contract. The investor can let
                                    the money accumulate in the annuity, withdraw the accumulated funds in a lump sum, or
                                    withdraw the accumulated funds periodically by annuitizing the contract. Annuitizing occurs
                                    when the investor converts from the accumulation (pay-in) stage to the distribution (payout)
                                    stage.

                                    The decision to annuitize the contract locks in the specified payout option. The contract
                                    holder may not change it. At that time, the death benefit provision terminates. Annuity
                                    payout options, in order from largest monthly payout to smallest monthly payout, follow.

                                    Life Annuity/Straight Life/Pure Life. Under this option, the payout is structured so that
                                    the annuitant receives periodic payments (usually monthly) until death. No added options or
                                    benefits exist; therefore, for a given amount of funds, this option provides the largest periodic
                                    payment.

                                       Life Annuity with Period Certain. Under the life annuity with period certain payout option,
                                       an annuitant receives payments for life, with a certain minimum period guaranteed. If the
                                       annuitant dies before the period certain expires, payments continue to the annuitant’s named
                                       beneficiaries for the period certain. If the annuitant lives beyond the period certain, payments
                                       continue until the annuitant’s death.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   A client purchases a life annuity with a 10-year period certain payout. The insurance
                                                   company guarantees payments for the life of the annuitant or 10 years, whichever
                                                   is longer. If the annuitant lives for only one year after payments begin, the company
                                                   continues to make payments to the annuitant’s beneficiaries for 9 more years. If the
                                                   annuitant dies after receiving payments for 13 years, payments cease at death.

                                       Joint Life with Last Survivor Annuity. With this option, the annuity covers two or more
                                       people, and the payout is conditioned on both (all) lives.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   A married couple owns an annuity jointly with a last survivor clause. The contract pays
                                                   benefits as long as one of the annuitants remains alive. The payment may be the same
                                                   as when both were alive, or it may be reduced for the surviving annuitant, depending
                                                   on the contract. If this option includes more than two annuitants, payments cease at
                                                   the last survivor’s death.

                                       Refund Annuity. Sometimes referred to as a unit refund annuity, under this settlement
                                       option, payments will continue after death of the insured until the full value of the initial
                                       premium (principal) has been returned. In some cases, the payment to the beneficiary will be
                                       a lump sum of cash, and in others, a series of monthly payments.


                                       Mortality Guarantee
                                       Annuity companies guarantee payments for as long as annuitants live. If a change occurs in
                                       life expectancy and annuitants live longer than originally anticipated, the insurance companies
                                       assume the increased mortality cost—the mortality guarantee.

                                                           Which of the following types of annuity settlement options provides a lifetime
                                                           income to the annuitant regardless of how long he lives, and the highest monthly

                                                             D. Joint and survivor annuity
                                                           Answer: A. A straight life annuity provides a lifetime income to the owner/annuitant
                                                           regardless of how long he lives. If the annuitant is fortunate to outlive his anticipated
                                                           life expectancy, he has made a wise distribution choice. However, if he dies shortly
                                                           after beginning distribution, he has made an imprudent choice because, after the
                                                           annuitant dies, the issuer makes no further payments. Nevertheless, for a given
                                                           purchase price, a single life annuity provides the highest monthly payment amount
                                                           because the annuity provides no guarantees beyond the annuitant’s life.

                                    Annuity Units
                                    When a variable annuity contract is annuitized, accumulation units are exchanged for annuity
                                    units. An annuity unit is a measure of value used only during an annuitized contract’s payout
                                    period. It is an accounting measure that determines the amount of each payment to the
                                    annuitant during the payout period.

                                    The number of annuity units is calculated when an owner annuitizes the contract. The
                                    number of annuity units liquidated each month does not change—it is fixed at the time of
                                    annuitizing, based on the value of the contract when the payout period begins and on other
                                    variables (such as the payout option selected, the individual’s age and sex, and assumed
                                    interest rate). The payment the annuitant will receive each month varies, because each unit’s
                                    value fluctuates with the separate account portfolio’s value. This is, after all, a variable annuity.


                                    Assumed Interest Rate (AIR)
                                    The assumed interest rate (AIR) is a basis for determining distributions from a variable
                                    annuity. The rate, usually estimated conservatively, provides an earnings target for the separate
                                    account. Simply put, if the actual earnings exceed the AIR, the annuity payments increase; if
                                    they fall short of the AIR, the payments decrease.

                                               EXAMPLE
                                               An investor who annuitized a variable annuity in 1990 and began with a monthly
                                               payout of $375 might now be receiving $2,275 per month because of an increase in the
                                               value of the annuity unit.



                                    LO 24.e Calculate the tax on an early withdrawal from an annuity.


                                    Premature Withdrawal
                                    Contributions to an annuity that is not part of an employer-sponsored retirement plan
                                    (qualified annuities) are made with after-tax dollars (nonqualified). Because contributions
                                    have been taxed already, when the account is annuitized, the portion of each payment

                                                                                                                                             Unit 24
                                    representing a return of the original principal is not taxed. As with other investments, the
                                    money invested in an annuity represents the investor’s cost basis.

                                    The primary advantage of an annuity as an investment is that the tax on interest, dividends,
                                    and capital gains is deferred until the owner withdraws money from the contract. On
                                    withdrawal, the amount exceeding the investor’s cost basis is taxed as ordinary income.


                                    Partial or Full Withdrawals
                                    One of the rights of the holder of an annuity contract is the ability to withdraw funds. A
                                    partial withdrawal is, as the term implies, when the policy holder requests part of the value of
                                    the account. A full withdrawal is when the request is to terminate the contract and receive all
                                    of the available funds.




24_0-2532_LEM_65E_Unit24.indd 589                                                                                                      28/10/22 3:31 PM

                                       Random and full withdrawals from annuity contracts (remember, all annuities are
                                       nonqualified unless stated to the contrary) are taxed under the last in, first out (LIFO)
                                       method. Earnings are presumed by the IRS to be the last monies to hit the account. The
                                       earnings are considered to be withdrawn first from the annuity and are taxable as ordinary
                                       income plus a 10% penalty if the investor has not reached 59½. After the withdrawal of all
                                       earnings, contributions representing cost basis may be withdrawn without tax.

                                       The penalty does not apply if the funds are withdrawn after age 59½, are withdrawn because
                                       of death or disability, or are part of a life-income option plan with fixed payouts (the contract
                                       is annuitized).

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   A contract with a $100,000 value consists of $40,000 in contributions and $60,000 in
                                                   earnings. If the investor withdraws all $100,000 at once, the $60,000 in earnings is
                                                   taxed as ordinary income and the $40,000 cost basis is returned tax free. If the investor
                                                   is at least 59½, there is no 10% tax penalty; if younger, the 10% tax penalty applies.
                                                   However, the penalty only applies to the taxable portion ($60,000)—there is never a
                                                   penalty tax on money that is not taxable. If the investor withdraws $10,000 (or any
                                                   amount up to $60,000), under the LIFO rule, it is considered a withdrawal of earnings
                                                   and will be taxed as ordinary income.
                                                   If a partial withdrawal of $50,000 is made, the entire withdrawal consists of earnings
                                                   and is taxable. There is never a capital gain with an annuity.

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   Yes, it is true: Even when the distribution is from a nonqualified annuity, if it is made
                                                   before the age of 59½, it is subject to the 10% additional tax (unless it meets one of the
                                                   exceptions listed above).


                                       Annuitizing
                                       Annuitized payouts are typically made monthly and are taxed according to an exclusion ratio.
                                       The exclusion ratio expresses the percentages of the annuity’s value upon annuitization of
                                       contribution basis to the total.

                                       Under certain circumstances, the annuitant’s life expectancy may also factor in the exclusion
                                       ratio, but that is unlikely to be tested—we’re just keeping it simple.

                                                   EXAMPLE
                                                   If $50,000 in after-tax dollars was contributed to an annuity contract worth $100,000 at
                                                   annuitization, 50% of each payment will be treated as ordinary income, whereas the
                                                   other 50% of each payment will be treated (for tax purposes) as nontaxable return of
                                                   basis.

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   Upon annuitization, there is never a 10% tax penalty, even if annuitization commences
                                                   prior to age 59½.

             LESSON 24.4: LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES
                                    LO 24.f Compare the major types of life insurance.

                                    A life insurance policy is a contract between an insurance company and an individual that
                                    is designed to provide financial compensation to the named beneficiaries in the event of the
                                    insured’s death. In exchange for payment of premiums, the insurance company agrees to pay
                                    the proceeds of the policy (the death benefit) upon the death of the insured.

                                    Many types of life insurance contracts are available; each type serves a different need. We will
                                    focus more attention on those contracts that use separate accounts to fund the death benefits
                                    and those that are considered securities, as defined by the Securities Act of 1933.


                                                                                                                                           Unit 24
                                    Term Insurance
                                    Term insurance is protection for a specified period; hence the description “term.” Term
                                    insurance provides pure protection and is the least expensive form of life insurance.

                                    The important facts about term life insurance policies include the following:
                                     They provide temporary insurance protection for a specified period of time (the policy
                                       term). For example, the term may be 1 year, 5 years, 10 years, 30 years, or to a specified
                                       age (such as age 65).
                                     They pay the death benefit only if the insured dies during the term of coverage. For
                                       example, a person buying a 20-year term policy at age 35 who dies at 56 will receive
                                       nothing.
                                     They do not accumulate cash value.

                                        The death protection and premium remain level for the specified term; e.g., a $100,000
                                          5-year term policy provides a death benefit of $100,000 anytime during that 5-year term.
                                        If renewed at the end of the term, the face amount remains the same, but, because the
                                          new premium is based upon the insured’s attained age, renewal premiums always increase.

                                       Term insurance has a variety of useful applications. One of the most common uses for term
                                       is to provide a substantial amount of coverage at a minimum cost. Because term insurance
                                       provides pure protection, it allows a person with a limited income to purchase more coverage
                                       than might otherwise be affordable. This is particularly important when there is a clear need
                                       for additional protection, particularly in the case of younger people who are married with
                                       children.

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   For test purposes, younger people with children are better off purchasing term
                                                   insurance because the lower premiums allow significantly more protection. For those
                                                   age 60 and older, the rates are generally prohibitive.


                                       Whole Life Insurance (WLI)
                                       A type of permanent or cash value insurance, whole life insurance (WLI) provides protection
                                       for the whole of life. Coverage begins on the date of issue and continues to the date of the
                                       insured’s death, provided the premiums are paid. The benefit payable is the face amount, or
                                       face value, of the policy, which remains constant throughout the policy’s life. The premium is
                                       set at the time of the policy’s issue and it, too, remains level for the policy’s life. As with all life
                                       insurance policies, the insured can choose how to spread out the premium payments (known
                                       as the mode). Premiums can be paid annually, semiannually, quarterly, or monthly. Please note
                                       that ordinary life or straight life are synonyms for whole life.


                                       Cash Values
                                       Unlike term insurance, which provides only a death benefit, whole life insurance combines
                                       a death benefit with an accumulation, or a savings element. This accumulation, commonly
                                       referred to as the policy’s cash surrender value, increases each year the policy is kept in force.
                                       In traditional whole life insurance, the insurer invests reserves in conservative investments
                                       (e.g., bonds, real estate, mortgage loans).

                                       Because of the low risk of such investments, the insurer can guarantee the policy’s cash value
                                       and the nonforfeiture options that are based on that cash value. Traditional life insurance
                                       reserves are held in the insurer’s general accounts.


                                       Policy Loans
                                       Once an insured has accumulated cash value, it cannot be forfeited. An insured may cash in
                                       a policy at any time by surrendering it in exchange for its cash value. An insured may also
                                       borrow a portion of the cash value in the form of a policy loan, but this must be paid back
                                       (with interest) in order to restore policy values. When a policyowner takes a cash value loan,
                                       the amount borrowed and any accumulated interest due on the loan become an indebtedness
                                       against the policy. If the insured dies before the loan has been repaid, any indebtedness will
                                       reduce the face amount of the policy accordingly—it will be subtracted from any death
                                       benefit.

                                    Policy Dividends
                                    Some whole life policies, known as participating policies, may pay dividends to the
                                    policyowner. These are not the same kind of dividends as we’ve covered throughout this
                                    course. Simply put, they are a return of the excess premiums charged on these policies.
                                    Because policy dividends are a return of premium, they are not taxable.


                                    Uses of Whole Life
                                    The principal advantage of whole life is that it is permanent insurance and accordingly can
                                    be used to satisfy permanent needs such as the cost of death, dying, and final burial expenses.
                                    The level premium allows the policyowner to always know exactly what the cost of insurance
                                    will be, and basically offers a form of forced savings. Whole life builds a living benefit through

                                    loans) for emergencies, as a supplemental source of retirement income, and for other living
                                    needs. The principal disadvantages of whole life insurance are that the premium paying period
                                    may last longer than the insured’s income-producing years, and it does not provide as much
                                    protection per dollar of premium as term insurance.

                                                   Answer: B. In almost all circumstances, certainly for short-to-immediate time
                                                   periods, term life will be the least expensive form of insurance. A 20-pay life is a
                                                   permanent policy where the premiums are paid in a 20-year period rather than until
                                                   death. Variable annuities are not life insurance policies even though they are issued
                                                   by life insurance companies.

                                    If the policyowner decides to stop paying the premiums, the policyowner may:
                                     surrender the policy for its cash value;
                                     take a reduced paid-up policy where the death benefit is decreased and future premiums
                                       are no longer required; or
                                     take extended term insurance, which pays the beneficiaries the full face amount if death
                                       occurs within a specified time period.

                                       Universal Life Insurance
                                       Universal life insurance was developed in the late 1970s in response to the relatively low
                                       interest rates (generally 3.5–5%) earned by traditional whole life insurance cash values,
                                       which made the whole life product less attractive during periods of high inflation. In order
                                       to be more competitive, insurers introduced universal life policies that might pay higher
                                       interest rates (such as 8%, 10%, or even 12%) during inflationary times. These policies also
                                       provide greater flexibility, because they allow policyowners to adjust the death benefits and/or
                                       premium payments based on their current needs assessment.

                                       A universal life policy is similar to a whole life policy in the sense that it has the same
                                       two components—death protection and cash value. However, instead of being fixed and
                                       guaranteed amounts, the death protection resembles one-year renewable term insurance, and
                                       the cash value grows according to current interest rates.


                                       Characteristics of Universal Life
                                        Premium payments are separated with the first being paid toward the insurance protection
                                          and the remaining balance being used to build the cash value (with interest).
                                        The policyowner may increase or decrease the death benefit during the policy term,
                                          subject to any insurability requirements.
                                        Premium amounts may be changed as long as enough premium is paid to maintain the
                                          policy. This is why universal life is known as flexible premium life. In fact, it is even
                                          possible to skip premium payments as long as there is sufficient cash value in the policy to
                                          keep it in force.
                                        The interest earned by the cash account will vary, subject to a guaranteed minimum.
                                        Universal life is not a security. Variable universal life (VUL) or universal variable life
                                          (UVL)—two ways of saying the same thing—is a security because of the variable.


                                       Universal Life Interest Rates
                                       Universal life contracts are actually subject to two different interest rates: the current annual
                                       rate and the contract rate.
                                        The current annual rate varies with current market conditions and may change every year.
                                        The contract rate is the minimum guaranteed interest rate, and the policy will never pay
                                          less than that amount.

                                       For example, if the guaranteed contract rate is 5% and the current rate is 8%, the cash
                                       account would grow by the higher 8% during that year. But if the current rate falls below 5%,
                                       the cash account would still grow by the minimum rate of 5% during that year.


                                       Universal Life Death Benefits
                                       Generally, there are two options available regarding the death benefit payable under a
                                       universal life policy.
                                        Option 1 (also known as option A) provides a level death benefit equal to the policy’s face
                                          amount. As the policy’s cash value increases, net death protection actually decreases over
                                          the life of the policy, which makes the policy structure similar to a whole life contract. The
                                          major advantage of option 1 is that the premiums are lower for the same face amount of
                                          death coverage. The trade-off is that the level death benefit will not keep pace with inflation.

                                                                                                 Unit 24   Insurance-Based Products   595


                                     Option 2 (also known as option B) provides for an increasing death benefit equal to the
                                       policy’s face amount plus the cash account. In terms of policy structure, this contract is
                                       more like a combination of level term insurance and increasing cash value than whole life
                                       insurance. The primary advantage of universal life insurance option B is that cash values
                                       grow more quickly over time. The cash values accumulate more quickly because of the
                                       higher initial premiums and lower initial death benefit. Because the premiums are higher
                                       and the death benefit is initially lower, a greater portion of the premium is added to the
                                       policy cash value, which then grows interest free inside the contract.

                                               TAKE NOTE
                                               With the original universal life policies, it was common that the flexibility of premium
                                               payments caused policies to lapse, with the result that one could not truly say
                                               there was a guaranteed death benefit. Because of this, most insurers today offer
                                               a guaranteed death benefit universal life, where the policy is guaranteed not to
                                               lapse if the sum of the premiums paid (less any loans or partial withdrawals and
                                               partial withdrawal fees) is greater than or equal to the sum of the minimum monthly
                                               premiums required. As a result, one can say that a universal life insurance policy has at
                                               least some guaranteed death benefit.


                                    Universal Life Policy Loans
                                    Universal life provides for cash value loans in the same manner that whole life or any
                                    permanent plan of insurance does. If a loan is taken, it is subject to interest and, if unpaid,
                                    both the interest and the loan amount will reduce the face amount of the policy.


                                    Uses of Universal Life
                                    This is a form of permanent insurance that can build cash values, hopefully at a rate greater
                                    than with traditional whole life. There is typically a guaranteed minimum interest rate
                                    stated in the policy (usually around 2%), which means that, no matter how the investments
                                    perform, there will be a known minimum return on the investment. The unique feature
                                    is the flexibility to adjust the death benefit as needs change, as well as the flexibility to
                                    pay smaller or larger premiums as financial conditions dictate. However, if the premium
                                    payments are reduced to the point where they can no longer support the policy, a lapse
                                    could occur. Another use of the flexibility of the premium payments is to “overfund” the
                                    policy, particularly when option 2 has been chosen—that is, pay premiums in excess of those                  Unit 24
                                    required, with that excess going into the savings portion of the policy. This can have the effect
                                    of greatly increasing the cash value: money that may be borrowed out of the policy without
                                    tax consequences if done properly. (This is beyond the coverage of this course.)

                                               PRACTICE QUESTION
                                                   All of the following are advantages of universal life insurance except
                                                    A. the ability to adjust the amount of premium payments.
                                                    B. the policy is guaranteed never to lapse.
                                                    C. the ability to change the death benefit amount.
                                                    D. when the cash value is sufficient, no premium payment is required.
                                                   Answer: B. A universal life policy may lapse if the accumulation fund drops below
                                                   a specified level and an additional premium is not paid. Universal life has flexible
                                                   premiums and, when there is sufficient cash value in the policy, premiums may be
                                                   skipped (with the premium payments taken from that cash value).

                                       Variable Life Insurance
                                       Variable life insurance differs from whole life insurance with regard to where the premium is
                                       invested. In the case of whole life insurance, the premiums are invested solely in the insurance
                                       company’s general account. On the other hand, in a variable life insurance (VLI) policy, the
                                       general account receives an amount equal to the actual cost of the life insurance, and the
                                       portion in excess of that is invested in a separate account. The separate account has a number
                                       of subaccounts with varying objectives, giving the insured some choice from highly aggressive
                                       (think mostly common stock) to highly conservative (think bonds and money market
                                       instruments).

                                       The purpose is to let the customer assume some investment risk in an attempt to get inflation
                                       protection for the policy’s death benefit.

                                       Cash value in the policy fluctuates with the performance of the chosen subaccounts in the
                                       separate account and is not guaranteed. Variable life policies provide policy owners with a
                                       minimum guaranteed death benefit. The benefit may increase above this minimum amount,
                                       depending on investment results, but may never fall below.

                                       Also, remember what was said earlier about variable annuities being securities requiring those
                                       who sell them to be dually licensed (insurance and securities); the same is true for those who
                                       wish to sell variable life insurance.


                                       Flexible Premium Variable Life (Universal)
                                       Universal variable life insurance (UVL or VUL) is a type of variable life insurance with
                                       flexible premiums (and thus a flexible death benefit). Premiums are invested only in a separate
                                       account, and there is only a variable death benefit. The insured has the option to increase,
                                       skip, or reduce premium payments, though he must maintain a minimum cash value, and the
                                       death benefit is adjusted appropriately.


                                       Scheduled (Fixed)-Premium Variable Life
                                       A scheduled-premium (or fixed-premium) VLI contract is issued with a minimum
                                       guaranteed death benefit. (The premiums for some variable life contracts are flexible; this
                                       is discussed next under variable universal life.) A scheduled-premium VLI contract’s death
                                       benefit is determined at issue, and evidence of insurability is required.

                                       The premium is calculated according to the insured’s age and sex and the policy’s face amount
                                       (guaranteed amount) at issue. Once the premium has been determined and the expenses
                                       have been deducted, the net premium is invested in the separate account’s subaccount(s) the
                                       policyowner selects.


                                       Deductions from the Premium
                                       Deductions from the gross premium normally reduce the amount of money invested in the
                                       separate account. The greater the deductions, the less money available for the investment base
                                       in the separate account. Charges deducted from the gross premium include:
                                        the administrative fee;
                                        the sales load; and
                                        state premium taxes (if any).

                                    The administrative fee is normally a one-time charge to cover the cost of processing the
                                    application.

                                    The maximum allowable sales load on variable life insurance is the equivalent of an average of
                                    9% of premium per year, computed over a 20-year period. The sales charge may be front-end
                                    loaded to 50% of the first year’s premium, but must average out to 9% over a 20-year period.
                                    Because of the front-end loading, there are special sales charge refund rights for the first two
                                    years, spelled out in the Investment Company Act of 1940.


                                    Deductions from the Separate Account
                                    Deductions from the separate account normally reduce the investment return payable to the
                                    policy owner. Charges deducted from the separate account include:
                                     mortality risk fee (cost of insurance);
                                     expense risk fee; and
                                     investment management fee.
                                    The mortality risk fee covers the risk that the insured may live for a period shorter than
                                    assumed. The expense risk fee covers the risk that the costs of administering and issuing the
                                    policy may be greater than assumed. And, of course, the investment management fee is the
                                    cost of the management of the chosen separate account’s subaccounts.

                                              TAKE NOTE
                                              The exam may ask you which charges are deducted from the gross premium and
                                              which are deducted from the separate account (the net premium). Remember the
                                              acronym SAS to make it simple. The charges deducted from the gross premium are:

                                               administrative fee; and
                                               state premium taxes.
                                              Any other charges, such as cost of insurance, expense risk fees, and investment
                                              management fees, are deducted from the net premium, which is invested in the
                                              separate account.

                                    Variable Life Insurance Death Benefit
                                    The death benefit payable under a variable life insurance policy consists of two parts: a
                                    guaranteed minimum provided by the portion of funds invested in the general account and
                                    a variable death benefit provided by those invested in the separate account. The guaranteed
                                    minimum does not change, but total benefit, including the variable portion of the death
                                    benefit, must be recalculated at least annually.

                                    The effect that a change in earnings has on the contract’s variable death benefit depends on
                                    a comparison of actual account performance and the performance assumed by the insurance
                                    company. If the separate account returns are greater than the assumed interest rate (AIR),
                                    additional funds are available to the insured. These extra earnings are reflected in an increase
                                    in the death benefit. If the separate account returns equal the AIR, actual earnings meet
                                    estimated expenses, resulting in no change in benefit levels. Should the separate account
                                    returns be less than the AIR, the contract’s death benefit may decrease; however, it may never
                                    fall below the amount guaranteed at issue.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   If a variable life insurance policy has a minimum (stated) death benefit, the premiums
                                                   necessary to fund this part of the death benefit are held in the insurer’s general
                                                   account. Any policy benefit that is guaranteed is invested in the insurer’s general
                                                   account.
                                                   Any premium above what is necessary to pay for the minimum death benefit is
                                                   invested in the separate account. This portion of the premium is subject to investment
                                                   risk. The death benefit will grow above the minimum guaranteed amount if the
                                                   separate account performs positively. The death benefit will never be less than the
                                                   minimum guarantee, even if the separate account performs poorly.

                                                   TAKE NOTE
                                                   With positive performance in the separate account, the death benefit will increase. If
                                                   this is followed by several periods of performance that fails to equal the AIR, the death
                                                   benefit will decline (but never below the minimum guarantee). If the decline has been
                                                   steep enough, it may take several periods of positive results before the death benefit
                                                   increases again.


                                       Variable Life Insurance Cash Value
                                       The policy’s cash values reflect the investments held in the separate account. Unlike the death
                                       benefit, the individual policy’s cash value must be calculated at least monthly.

                                       The cash value, like the death benefit, may increase or decrease depending on the separate
                                       account’s performance. However, because the cash value is not based on any assumed interest
                                       rate (AIR), any positive performance will result in cash value growth. If performance has been
                                       negative, the cash value may decrease to zero, even if the contract has been in force for several
                                       years. The cash value cannot be negative, but the insurance company keeps track of negative
                                       performance. Therefore, like the death benefit, the cash value may not increase until prior
                                       negative performance has been offset.

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   The AIR has no effect on cash value accumulation in a variable life policy. The cash
                                                   value will grow whenever the separate account has positive performance. The AIR,
                                                   however, does affect the death benefit.

                                                   You may see a question that asks about the frequency of certain calculations
                                                   associated with variable life insurance policies. Know that:

                                      It must be emphasized that variable life insurance must be sold as life insurance, not as an
                                      investment. However, the ability to commit a portion of the premium to investor selected
                                      separate account subaccounts makes this form of insurance unique. There is a guaranteed
                                      minimum death benefit, but if separate account performance merits such, the death benefit
                                      can increase to keep pace with inflation. Cash values, although not guaranteed, can also
                                      increase based upon that performance. As with any variable product, the investor bears the
                                      investment risk rather than the insurance company.

                                      Variable Life Policy Loans
                                      Like traditional whole life insurance, a VLI contract allows the insured to borrow against the
                                      cash value that has accumulated in the contract. However, certain restrictions exist. Usually,
                                      the insured may only borrow a percentage of the cash value. The minimum percentage that
                                      must be made available is 75% after the policy has been in force for three years. If the death
                                      benefit becomes payable during any period that a loan is outstanding, the loan amount is

                                                   Several testable facts about policy loans are as follows.
                                                    A minimum of 75% of the cash value must be available for a policy loan after the
                                                      policy has been in force for three years.
                                                    The insurer is never required to loan 100% of the cash value. Full cash value is
                                                      obtained by surrendering the policy to the insurer.
                                                    If the insured dies with a loan outstanding, the death benefit is reduced by the
                                                      amount of the loan.
                                                    If the insured surrenders the contract with a loan outstanding, cash value is
                                                      reduced by the amount of the loan.


                                       Variable Life Insurance Contract Exchange
                                       A unique feature of variable life insurance is the ability for the insured to have a change of
                                       heart. During the early stage of ownership, you have the right to exchange a VLI contract
                                       for a form of permanent insurance issued by the company with comparable benefits (usually
                                       whole life). The length of time this exchange privilege is in effect varies from company to
                                       company, but under no circumstances may the period be less than 24 months (federal law).

                                       The exchange is allowed without evidence of insurability. If a contract is exchanged, the new
                                       permanent policy has the same contract date and death benefit as the minimum guaranteed
                                       in the VLI contract. The premiums equal the amounts guaranteed in the new permanent
                                       contract (as if it were the original contract).

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   Three testable facts about the contract exchange provision are listed here.
                                                    The contract exchange provision must be available for a minimum of 24 months
                                                      (it could say 2 years on the exam).
                                                    No medical underwriting (evidence of insurability) is required for the exchange.
                                                    The new policy is issued as if everything were retroactive; that is, the age of the
                                                      insured as of the original date is the age used for premium calculations for the
                                                      new policy.


                                       Variable Life Insurance Voting Rights
                                       Unlike any other type of life insurance, variable life contract holders have voting rights.
                                       Contract holders receive one vote per $100 of cash value funded by the separate account.
                                       As with other investment company securities, changes in investment objectives and other
                                       important matters may be accomplished only by a majority vote of the separate account’s
                                       outstanding shares or by order of the state insurance commissioner.

                                                   TEST TOPIC ALERT
                                                   Do not confuse the voting rights of variable annuities and variable life. Variable
                                                   annuities and mutual funds are the same: one vote per unit (share). Variable life is one
                                                   vote per $100 of cash value.

                                         of $30,000. If the client wanted to borrow as much as possible, the insurance

                                      Covered Advisers (with Review Annotation Notes)
                                      The North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) has adopted a Model
                                      Rule on unethical business practices of investment advisers and their representatives. This
                                      Model Rule is reproduced here, with review notes included.

                                      An investment adviser is a fiduciary and has a duty to act primarily for the benefit of its
                                      clients. While the extent and nature of this duty varies according to the nature of the
                                      relationship between an investment adviser and its clients and the circumstances of each case,
                                      an investment adviser shall not engage in unethical business practices, including the following:
                                      1.   Recommending to a client to whom investment supervisory, management, or consulting
                                           services are provided the purchase, sale, or exchange of any security without reasonable
                                           grounds to believe that the recommendation is suitable for the client on the basis of information
                                           furnished by the client after reasonable inquiry concerning the client’s investment objectives,
                                           financial situation and needs, and any other information known by the investment adviser.
                                           Review Note: An investment adviser providing investment supervisory, management, or
                                           consulting services has a fundamental obligation to analyze a client’s financial situation
                                           and needs before making any recommendation to the client. Recommendations made to
                                           a client must be reasonable in relation to the information that is obtained concerning the
                                           client’s investment objectives, financial situation and needs, and other information known
                                           by the investment adviser. By failing to make reasonable inquiry or by failing to make
                                           recommendations that are in line with the financial situation, investment objectives, and
                                           character of a client’s account, an investment adviser has not met its primary responsibility.
                                      2.   Exercising any discretionary power in placing an order for the purchase or sale of securities
                                           for a client without obtaining prior written discretionary authority from the client, unless the
                                           discretionary power relates solely to the price at which, or the time when, an order involving a
                                           definite amount of a specified security shall be executed, or both.
                                           Review Note: This rule pertains only to investment advisers that place orders for client
                                           accounts. Before placing an order for an account, an investment adviser exercising
                                           discretion should have written discretionary authority from the client. In most cases,
                                           discretionary authority is granted in an advisory contract or in a separate document
                                           executed at the time the contract is executed. The rule permits oral discretionary authority
                                           to be used for the initial transactions in a customer’s account within the first 10 business
                                           days after the date of the first transaction. An investment adviser is not precluded from
                                           exercising discretionary power that relates solely to the price or time at which an order
                                           involving a specific amount of a security is authorized by a customer because time and
                                           price do not constitute discretion.
                                      3.   Inducing trading in a client’s account that is excessive in size or frequency in view of the
                                           financial resources, investment objectives, and character of the account.
                                           Review Note: This rule is intended to prevent an excessive number of securities
                                           transactions from being induced by an investment adviser. There are many situations
                                           where an investment adviser may receive commissions or be affiliated with a person that
                                           receives commissions from the securities transactions that are placed by the investment
                                           adviser. Because an adviser in such situations can directly benefit from the number of
                                           securities transactions effected in a client’s account, the rule appropriately forbids an

                                           excessive number of transaction orders to be induced by an adviser for a customer’s
                                           account.
                                      4.   Placing an order to purchase or sell a security for the account of a client without authority to do
                                           so.
                                           Review Note: This rule is not new to either the securities or investment advisory
                                           professions. An investment adviser must have authority to place any order for the account
                                           of a client. The authority may be obtained from a client orally or in an agreement
                                           executed by the client giving the adviser blanket authority.
                                      5.   Placing an order to purchase or sell a security for the account of a client upon instruction of a
                                           third party without first having obtained a written third-party trading authorization from the
                                           client.
                                           Review Note: It is sound business practice for an investment adviser not to place an order
                                           for the account of a customer at the instruction of a third party without first knowing
                                           that the third party has obtained authority from the client for the order. For example,
                                           it would be important for an investment adviser to know that an attorney had power of
                                           attorney over an estate whose securities the adviser was managing before placing any order
                                           at the instruction of the attorney. Placing orders under such circumstances could result in
                                           substantial civil liability besides being an unethical practice.
                                      6.   Borrowing money or securities from a client unless the client is a broker-dealer, an affiliate of
                                           the investment adviser, or a financial institution engaged in the business of loaning funds.
                                           Review Note: Unless a client of an investment adviser is engaged in the business of
                                           loaning money, is an affiliate of the investment adviser, or is an institution that would
                                           engage in this type of activity, an investment adviser must not take advantage of its
                                           advisory role by borrowing funds from a client. A client provides a substantial amount
                                           of confidential information to an investment adviser regarding the client’s financial
                                           situation and needs. Using that information to an investment adviser’s own advantage
                                           by borrowing funds is a breach of confidentiality and may create a material conflict of
                                           interest that could influence the advice rendered by the adviser to the client.
                                      7.   Loaning money to a client unless the investment adviser is a financial institution engaged in
                                           the business of loaning funds or the client is an affiliate of the investment adviser.
                                           Review Note: Like borrowing money from a client, loaning funds to a client by an
                                           investment adviser should not be an allowable practice unless the investment adviser is a
                                           financial institution normally engaged in the business of loaning funds or unless the client
                                           is affiliated with the adviser. Loaning funds may influence decisions made for a client’s
                                           account and puts the investment adviser in a conflict of interest position because the
                                           client becomes a debtor of the adviser after a loan is made.
                                      8.   To misrepresent to any advisory client, or prospective advisory client, the qualifications of the
                                           investment adviser or any employee of the investment adviser, or to misrepresent the nature of
                                           the advisory services being offered or fees to be charged for such service, or to omit to state a
                                           material fact necessary to make the statements made regarding qualifications, services, or fees,
                                           in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.
                                           Review Note: When an investment adviser offers its services to a prospective client or
                                           when it provides services to an existing client, the qualifications of the investment adviser
                                           or any employee of the investment adviser and the nature of the advisory services and
                                           the fees to be charged must be disclosed in such a way as to not mislead. Overstating
                                           the qualifications of the investment adviser or disclosing inaccurately the nature of the
                                           advisory services to be provided or fees to be charged are not ethical ways to either acquire
                                           or retain clients.
                                      9.   Providing a report or recommendation to any advisory client prepared by someone other than
                                           the adviser without disclosing the fact. (This prohibition does not apply to a situation where




25_0-2532_LEM_65E_Appendix.indd 607                                                                                                            03/11/22 1:20 PM

                                          the adviser uses published research reports or statistical analyses to render advice or where an
                                          adviser orders such a report in the normal course of providing service.)
                                          Review Note: If an investment adviser provides a report to a client that is prepared by a
                                          third party, the adviser has a responsibility to disclose the fact to the client. By entering
                                          into an investment advisory agreement, the client relies on the expertise of the adviser
                                          to provide the advisory service. Thus, if the advice is provided by a third party, it is
                                          imperative that the adviser disclose this fact to the client so the client is not misled. The
                                          prohibition does not apply when an investment adviser gathers and uses research materials
                                          before making its recommendation to a client.
                                      10. Charging a client an unreasonable advisory fee.
                                          Review Note: This rule is intended to prohibit an investment adviser from charging an
                                          excessively high advisory fee. Unreasonable as used in this rule means unreasonable in
                                          relation to fees charged by other advisers for similar services. Although no two advisory
                                          services are exactly alike, comparisons can be drawn. In those instances where an advisory
                                          fee is out of line with fees charged by other advisers providing essentially the same
                                          services, an investment adviser should justify the charge. It would be very difficult for a
                                          client to compare various advisory services to evaluate those services and the fees charged.
                                          This rule will allow state Administrators to research the competitiveness of an adviser’s
                                          services and fees and to determine whether the fees being charged are unreasonably high.
                                      11. Failing to disclose to clients in writing, before any advice is rendered, any material conflict of
                                          interest relating to the adviser or any of its employees which could reasonably be expected to
                                          impair the rendering of unbiased and objective advice, including:
                                          a.   compensation arrangements connected with advisory services to clients which are in
                                               addition to compensation from such clients for such services, and
                                          b.   charging a client an advisory fee for rendering advice when a commission for executing
                                               securities transactions pursuant to such advice will be received by the adviser or its
                                               employees.
                                          Review Note: This rule is designed to require disclosure of all material conflicts of interest
                                          relating to the adviser or any of its employees that could affect the advice that is rendered.
                                          The two examples cited in the rule pertain to compensation arrangements that benefit the
                                          adviser and are connected with advisory services being provided. However, full disclosure
                                          of all other material conflicts of interest, such as affiliations between the investment
                                          adviser and product suppliers, is also required to be made under the rule.
                                      12. Guaranteeing a client that a specific result will be achieved (gain or no loss) with advice that
                                          will be rendered.
                                          Review Note: An investment adviser should not guarantee any gain or against loss in
                                          connection with advice that is rendered. By doing so, the adviser fails to maintain an
                                          arms-length relationship with a client and puts himself in a conflict of interest position by
                                          having a direct interest in the outcome of the advice rendered by the adviser.
                                      13. Publishing, circulating, or distributing any advertisement which does not comply with the
                                          Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
                                          Review Note: An investment adviser should not publish, circulate, or distribute
                                          any advertisement that is inconsistent with federal rules governing the use of
                                          advertisements. The SEC amended the rules for investment adviser advertising in 2020,
                                          and NASAA has not yet updated their Model Rule to reflect the changes, such as certain

                                          Review Note: An investment advisory firm has a responsibility to ensure that all
                                          information collected from a client be kept confidential. The only exception to the rule
                                          should be in those instances where the client authorized the release of such information,
                                          or when the investment advisory firm is required by law to disclose such information.
                                      15. Taking any action, directly or indirectly, with respect to those securities or funds in which any
                                          client has any beneficial interest, where the investment adviser has custody or possession of
                                          such securities or funds when the adviser’s action is subject to and does not comply with the
                                          requirements of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
                                          Review Note: In instances where an investment adviser has custody or possession of a
                                          client’s funds or securities, it should comply with the regulations under the Investment
                                          Advisers Act of 1940 designed to ensure the safekeeping of those securities and funds.
                                          The rules under the act specifically provide that securities of clients be segregated and
                                          properly marked, that the funds of the clients be deposited in separate bank accounts, that
                                          the investment adviser notify each client as to the place and manner in which such funds
                                          and securities are being maintained, that an itemized list of all securities and funds in
                                          the adviser’s possession be sent to the client not less frequently than every three months,
                                          and that all such funds and securities be verified annually by actual examination by an
                                          independent CPA on a surprise basis. The rule establishes very conservative measures to
                                          safeguard each client’s funds and securities held by an investment adviser.
                                      16. Entering into, extending, or renewing any investment advisory contract unless such contract is
                                          in writing and discloses, in substance, the services to be provided, the term of the contract, the
                                          advisory fee, the formula for computing the fee, the amount of prepaid fee to be returned in the
                                          event of contract termination or non-performance, whether the contract grants discretionary
                                          power to the adviser, and that no assignment of such contract shall be made by the investment
                                          adviser without the consent of the other party to the contract.
                                          Review Note: The purpose of this rule is to ensure that clients have a document to refer
                                          to that describes the basic terms of the agreement that the client has entered into with an
                                          adviser.

                                      The conduct set forth previously is not inclusive. Engaging in other conduct such as
                                      nondisclosure, incomplete disclosure, or deceptive practices shall be deemed an unethical
                                      business practice.
