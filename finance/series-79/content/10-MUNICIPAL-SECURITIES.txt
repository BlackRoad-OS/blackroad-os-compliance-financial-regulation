                                        The SEC defines electronic communications as graphic communications. These include
                                        ROMs, and mass voicemail messages. Graphic communications are considered written
                                        communications under SEC rules.

                                                     investors, the presentation would then constitute a graphic communication.
                                        recorded and rebroadcast, it would fall under the definition of a graphic communication and
                                        not viewed as a graphic communication or prospectus by the SEC.
                                                     While an oral presentation itself is not a written communication, all handouts given in
