                                       Filing the Registration Statement

                                       Form S-1
                                       To register a new issue with the SEC, a first-time issuer generally files a registration statement
                                       using Form S-1. Included in the statement are the following:
                                       Form S-3 is a short-form registration statement available to domestic issuers who are either

                      LO 7.b    Recall the elements of a prospectus.
                      A prospectus, as defined by the Securities Act of 1933, is any “notice, circular, advertisement,
                      Communications Not Deemed a Prospectus
                      The definition of a prospectus is intentionally broad. The SEC, however, has ruled that there
                       Communication sent after the effective date and a prospectus has been delivered at, or
                       Notice indicating where a prospectus may be obtained, identifies the security, gives the               Unit 7
                                considered a prospectus. Care must be taken, however, to ensure that the
                                or else it would fall under the definition of a prospectus.
                      Types of Prospectuses
                      Free Writing Prospectuses
                      A free writing prospectus is any written communication that is an offer to buy or sell securities
                      related to a registered offering. It can be considered a supplement to the prospectus and may
                      not use a free writing prospectus.
                                Free writing prospectuses may take the form of many types of communications such
                      When a seasoned or unseasoned issuer distributes a free writing prospectus, it must be
                      preceded by a copy of the prospectus. This requirement implies that the registration statement
                      must first be filed with the SEC, before any free writing prospectuses may be used. WKSIs,
                      however, do not have the same restriction. WKSIs may issue a free writing prospectus
                      regardless of whether the registration statement has been filed or not.
                                A free writing prospectus can contain information beyond what is found in the
                                registration statement, but it cannot conflict with the registration statement.

                                        not viewed as a graphic communication or prospectus by the SEC.
                                        While road shows may be considered free writing prospectuses, they are only required to make
                                        the same filings as other free writing prospectuses during an IPO of common or convertible
