                                        is one in which the issuer selects an underwriter and negotiates the terms of the offering. A

                     Firm Commitment
                     The firm commitment is the most widely used type of underwriting contract. Under its terms,
                     the underwriter contracts with the issuing corporation, selling stockholders, or both, to buy
                     a given date—all of which is spelled out in a letter of intent signed by both the underwriter
                     Although this letter of intent is conditional, for all practical purposes, the underwriter is
                     committing to buying securities from the issuer and paying the underwriting proceeds to the
                     company. The underwriter does this without full assurance that the securities can be resold to
                     the public at a profit. If part of an issue that is being distributed under a firm commitment
                     contract goes unsold, any losses incurred are borne by the syndicate members.
                                In firm commitment offerings, underwriters will often use a commitment committee
                     Best Efforts
                     A best efforts arrangement calls for the underwriter to sell the securities from the issuer
                     as agent, not as principal. The underwriters are not committed and, therefore, are not at
                     risk. The underwriters will use their best efforts to sell all of the issue but will not give
                     any assurances that they will sell any of the securities. A best efforts offering is usually
                     nonexclusive, meaning other underwriters can freely participate in the issue.
                                but—after exerting best efforts—the underwriter is able to distribute only 80,000
                                shares, the extent of the underwriter’s commitment is limited to 80,000 shares and not

                                        Standby underwritings come into play when a publicly held corporation proposes to issue
                     shares. To ensure that all the additional issues will be sold, a standby underwriter is engaged.
                     This firm unconditionally agrees (firm commitment) to buy all shares not subscribed to by

                                       The letter of intent will also address the risks the underwriter is willing to assume and the risks
                                       that will be assumed by the issuer. One risk the underwriter never assumes is the risk that an

                                       The investment bank that negotiates with the issuer is the managing underwriter. To reduce
                                       risk, the manager will form a syndicate, inviting other member firms into the underwriting
                                       group. Once formed, the syndicate members will sign an agreement, called the agreement
                                       among underwriters, which details the responsibilities and obligations of each syndicate
                                       The syndicate manager in a firm commitment underwriting is often referred to as the
                                       statutory (or lead) underwriter. Another term by which the lead underwriter has been called is

                                       group. These members are the selling group—firms that help the syndicate sell the new issue.
                                       Unlike syndicate members, selling group firms assume no risk. They act solely as agents in the

                     Agreement Among Underwriters
                     LO 6.c    Define the agreement among the underwriters.
                     The topics addressed in this agreement, which is signed by all syndicate members, include the
                     Participation of Each Syndicate Member
                     The level of participation of each syndicate member is essentially what percentage of the
                     offering each syndicate member is obligated to buy from the issuer.
                     The manager’s fee is the amount, expressed in cents per share, which the syndicate manager

                     If the syndicate is unable to sell all the securities purchased from the issuer, the unsold
                     securities remain in the syndicate account. The liability for these unsold shares rests with the
                     syndicate members on either a divided (Western account) or undivided (Eastern account)
                     The agreement among underwriters must state that, consistent with Regulation M, the book-
